is a cinematic marvel its nostalgia meticulousness and joy captured my heart and earned itself the title of one of the best musicals of all timealmost every aspect of is close to perfect making this not only one of the best movies in recent history but also one of the best looking films and a very memorable cinematic experience the cinematography is lively with phenomenal long takes different location and gorgeous colours thanks to the production design ryan gosling and emma stone make a wonderful musical duo with serious chemistry as if the roles were made for them the music feels alive at any moment and the sound track is definitely consistent after whiplash the stakes were high for damien chazelle and undoubtedly lands him a spot on hollywoods best directors pulling of two films of the same genre and making both of them seem unique and originally is no easy thing to do and writing a film can be agonising so damien chazelle deserves all the praise hes gettingis a genre defying masterpiece which i would recommend to anyone a fan of musicals or not its colourful joyfulness is a sight to seefinal score 910,happy
do i like musicals not really but damn is a nostalgic colourful joyful marveldamien chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama whiplash what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row well if is anything to go by then id say he did the job with just three films under his belt as of 2016 chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen his passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like singin in the rain the umbrellas of cherborg and even rebel without a cause the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something i was pleased aboutthe chemistry between gosling and stone is strong to say the least after two previous collaborations their alreadystrong bond helped them become one of modernday cinemas finest couples the music is bouncy and toetapping catchy the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes and the locations sum up the american dream and the passion the characters hold for los angeles is by far one of the finest cinema experiences i have had in the past 510 years and although this isnt a film i would typically enjoy genrewise chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade a film i would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the cinemascope magic,happy
the main characters in this los angeles romantic musical are mia emma stone a coffeeshop employee with dreams of being an actress and sebastian ryan gosling a jazz pianist who aspires to open his own club that plays jazz like it was played in the good old daysat long last a movie released during the 2016 awards season that actually lives up to the hypeearly in the film there are two superb group musical numbers the numbers that follow are more lowkey relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executedthe stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable they include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre jazz while too often being told it is a dying artgosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but its not long before he fits into the part quite nicely stone is superb throughout the film she is even spoton as an actress giving mediocre auditions shes given a full range  and not just as a triple threat  and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song audition near the endthere is something uniquely enjoyable about hollywood portraying itself the movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like singin in the rain les demoiselles de rochefort and les parapluies de cherbourg all the while being unique and standing out on its own in addition the set designs and photography add further to the films greatnessthe reference to les parapluies de cherbourg comes through strongly in the movies final number this scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016 it leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side the production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholythe teaming of directorwriter damien chazelle with musical composer justin hurwitz is one of the best matches since jacques demy and michel legrand in the 1960soutstanding achievements1 directing by damien chazelle2 acting by emma stone3 music by justin hurwitz,happy
writerdirector damien chazelle who already had a nice career going for him explodes into the bigtime with this delightful mesmerizing and completely unexpected ode to tinseltownthe opening sequence satirized on the golden globes really does not do the rest of the film justice it is as if the cast from the fame remake grew up had children of their own and then those children hijacked the santa monica freeway to do a 10 minute flashmob dance sequencefrom that point on the film is hypnoticwe segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s if the film had been in bw you would almost have expected to see bette davis in a 3hankie tear jerkerexcept for the musical interludes of course which are pitch perfect and totally wonderfulgosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance but he delivers the goods stone who was supposed to be the next big thing after easy a 2010 steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well the awards should flow like water and she will deserve every oneas i said deep in the dna this is an ode to hollywood the film industry has always had issues with endings  back in the day they would film several different endings per picture  and then decide at the last minute which to use here chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending along with the real ending along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in hollywood is actually real but everything still can be really fundestined to be a classic recommended,happy
the last time i felt like this in a cinema i was six years old and i was watching star wars i never imagined i would ever find that feeling again in a cinema that sense of being transported to another world the opening sequence took my breath away and i never got it back not even at the end  which left my head spinning it is a beautiful film with soul wit charm style and love it is simply outrageous bold and fantastic and fantastical i am a straight man but my love for ryan gosling could change all that hes a melancholy genius and emma stone is our muse this film defies genre it is a masterpiece i urge you to see it i was lucky enough to see it at the bfi london film festvial it has been five days since i saw and i am still thinking about it and singing the haunting refrain that plays with your soul i mean it gets in there  that music  the music of the firmament flying still dreaming still thank you damien,happy
damien chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies from federico fellini to jacques demy hallellujah ryan gosling and emma stone go back to inspire us forward whats more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing so refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience damian chazelle whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions i would love to see a thriller directed by chazelle something like shadow of a doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like midnight lace thats what happens when we discover a new and startling talent you want to see him do everything i have a feeling this young artist will,happy
i was interested in seeing this film because not only am i a sucker for a good musical but ill admit to being a big fan of ryan gosling and i was intrigued to see what the director of whiplash would do with a musical picture to make it fresh and unique so when i had the chance to see a lateplanned viewing at the london film festival i jumped at the chance fyi ryan gosling came to the screening as a surprise post film qa attendee despite not appearing at the headline gala the night before so i was chuffedthe premise of the story is that stone is a young actress who has moved to la to wait tables while auditioning to try and make it while gosling is a jazz purist anyone who doesnt like jazz just doesnt have the rightcontext he insists who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own jazz bar or to put it succinctly  two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams the musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between with great music throughoutthe most impressive thing about the film for me is just how daringly it dances between the oldfashioned singing in the rain style of musical and a bolder modern style the song numbers are great the opening number received a round of applause in my viewing and are an undoubted homage to classic musicals  a thoughtful mixture of old school dance numbers youd expect from a musical in the 50s and emotionallywrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts there is one particular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real gutpunch stylistically the film skirts this same line the film again looks and acts like a classic musical but frequently we see lowkey reminders that this is modern day actresses using their iphones a video being seen on youtube etc to remind us that this is set in the present day if we didnt have these reminders the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is the 1950s the cinematography is beautiful and overall the film is visually stunning there is also no doubt that it is wonderfully directed with the same masterful control of pace and tension that we come to expect from damien chazelle thanks to whiplashgosling in particular is absolutely terrific with a typically sardonic wit throughout at the start of the film when his sister says shes worried about him as life seems to have him on the ropes he responds i wanna be on the ropes im just letting life think it has me and then before you know it  bam its a classic ropeadope his delivery of these sorts of lines cant be matched and its easy to see why the producers said in the postfilm qa that he was the person they wanted for the role in their wildest dreams its a role made for him with tons more of the above kind of lines but more than that gosling captures a real emotional intensity at the films emotional breaking points more specifically in the sequence towards the end of the film that i mentioned earlier he manages to convey such convincing emotion without so much as a wordid feel bad if i didnt also praise emma stone who has probably never been better she has wonderful emotional range from the ecstatic highs of love to the tearful painful lows in terms of the goslingstone films this is by far the best their undoubted chemistry is given the full spotlight in this film with freedom to explore said chemistry without restriction the film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be  an unashamedly romantic musical infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from goslingstone wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from chazelle oh and its hilarious throughout too a genuine achievement  must be one of the best films ive seen in a long while im annoyed ill have to wait so long to see it again franklywill surely win multiple oscars and other awards,happy
when i first saw the trailer for my expectations were set high the excellent cast the music and an exciting new directorwriter were enough to get me in the door im always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals will it be stagy stilted and awkward not in this case damien chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world having lived in la and worked on both sides of the camera i can relate to much of this films endearing observations trials and tribulations but anyone whos ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this films gargantuan heart im a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what i see but gave me all the feels and more i cannot recommend this film enough its the kind of film you leave and you dont want the buzz the tickle the moviehigh to end i cant wait to see it again when its in wide release the artist in me is inspired again,happy
a little film not sure whether you might have heard of it yet damien chazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient whiplash  my top film of 2015  with a surefire theatrefiller in the old fashioned musical extravaganza is back and back with styletells the bittersweet love story of sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone who first meet in an la traffic jam but then get thrown together by chance la is such a small place after all over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a hopeless attempt to break through in las tough movie business she makes ends meet as a barista on the warner brothers lot meanwhile sebastian is on a mission of his own a talented musician he is trying to restore jazz to the main stage something the films soundtrack will undoubtedly help do by opening his own classic jazz bar as both strive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us the classic hollywood ending the film is technically astonishing with clever continuous shots of the birdman variety and masterly cinematography by linus sandgren of joy and american hustle the lighting team in particular is superb a case in point is mias inseine sic song with breathtaking fades of the background to darkness a camera whizzaround the actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality loved it overall there are enough similar moments in the film to make cinemalovers like me gasp with delighttheres a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely deliberate whilst there are obvious and nonapologetic throwbacks to the classic musicals of the 50s like west side story and singin in the rain and references to casablanca and rebel without a cause there is also a 60s vibe to the girls getting ready sequence an 80s aha cover thrown in at a pool party and a californian prius obsession that is surely more noughties than current most curiously while everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce changes to plans the film is almost distancing itself from much of modern lifein the acting stakes emma stone again shines like a beacon she is just magnetic on the screen tiny spoiler the biggest plot hole in the film is why on earth she wasnt given the part for her first audition i was disappointed she didnt win the best supporting actress oscar for birdman in the 87th awards she lost out to patricia arquette for boyhood but she just keeps getting better and better and better ryan goslings confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma in particular it is astonishing that gosling could play only a few chords on the piano before training for the film a confidence boost for struggling piano learners everywhere it is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles emma watson allegedly turned it down for beauty and the beast something she might be kicking herself for are they both the best singers and dancers when compared to gene kelly fred astaire debbie reynolds rip or cyd charisse no undoubtedly not but they have an undeniable charm all of their own perhaps we will see the ilk of the great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the classic musical can hollywood take a hint the big question now that both stone and gosling have won golden globes for acting in the comedy or musical category can they convert that to oscar glory where there is a single category in play id like to think so its also great to see proper moviemaking taking place in the hollywood studios again during my recent visits to la there seemed to be little other than tv work going on in the main studio complexes there although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of the filming was actually done on the warner brothers lot musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music and justin hurwitz whiplash has produced a gem with  notwithstanding the jazz numbers and a catchy little pop number from john legend  merely a handful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different variations throughout the film the soundtrack is already in my amazon library and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary monday here in the ukdamien chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original script there is really very little i can fault the film on in what was the somewhat patchy coen brothers offering from last year  hail caesar  there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance number with channing tatum that i raved about you can find it on youtube if i was being picky then this tantalizing snippet would be a better representation of the style and vim of the original genre   with the exception of the opening number few of the song and dance numbers in quite get to that broadway melody level of scale and energy this together with a few concerns about the pacing in some places led me to rate this as a 45 on first viewinghowever on now seeing it twice within 36 hours its got me well and truly under its spell i normally emotionally resist films that arrive with excessive hype but in this case i give in 1010for the graphical version

is a triumph on so many levels it hooks you from the beginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart fluttering in the club at the end damien chazelle has proved himself to be one of the most talented directorsscreenwriters in film right nowthe film gets you with its charm it flows from the dialogue like poetry the chemistry between stone and gosling makes the film livelier stone has slowly shown herself as a force to be reckon with in hollywood and now gosling has join the ranks after his stellar performance as the jazz pianist whos main dream is watch jazz live on stone is a wanna be actress who cant find her way together they thrive off each others love and support as they try to accomplish their goals together each have a chance at their first oscar goldwhat else helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs i found myself humming city of stars all night long already saving the soundtrack on every music platform i could the music and dance numbers are a perfect blend of gene kelly musicals and more contemporary stuff like chicago the production design helps with this with bright vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building to emma stones dress a charming film only works when all cylinders click this one was clockworklike whiplash the editing is superb timing well with the score making it very appealing to the eye but the cinematography was mind blowing able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts made it very astonishing not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped each scene was extremely well thought out to cause the biggest awe effect or to provide strong symbolism but the ending is what can really make or break a movie this one makes it 10x better it goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop opening the audiences eyes to the entire meaning of the story beyond the theme of follow your dreams the idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them but life isnt your own everything does not end perfectlywhen combining all these elements together you get one of if not the best film of the year in a year where things became bitter this really ends the year on a high note cheers to the dreamers the men and women behind the making of this musical classic,happy
what is everyone in this film singing and dancing about our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in la the opening musical number is painful to watch but i assume the story will improveour central characters are an actress who aspires to be a famous movie star and a musician who aspires to be a moody jazz pianist she falls in love with him when she first hears him play his music he falls in love with her as they begin to date and explore hollywood they soon trip head over heals in love and as if by magic they dance with bliss along the milky way the only problem is  she soon reveals that she does not understand what is so great about jazz wait  i thought she loved his music when she first heard him play so he explains the history of jazz and the poetry of the musician that seems good enough and they continue their starry eyed romance but her auditions are a bust no work nothing changes she has to write a one woman play to perform to demonstrate her craft yet he lands an opportunity to perform in a big band  the only problem is the music will be more upbeat pop funk jazz hybrid that will make him pretty good money but also take him away from his dreams to be the moody jazz pianist he sells out to get work  and she stays true to herself and finds no work this creates a schism and they have a very corny argument about creative direction he does not understand what is wrong with him making money and traveling and being famous even if he truly knows that it sells out his dreams she does not understand why she cannot get work even though she stays true to her dreams  and when her one woman show is a dud she decides to quit her dreams and move back home our dashing hero feels awful and soon learns that she has one final audition that awaits and so he drives to her home in nevada to tell her that she must return for one final audition they travel back to la  she sings at her audition  and she gets the role both have their own careers now  so they split up five years later  she is a famous movie star married with children and he has his own jazz club where he lives his dreams as a moody jazz pianist one night by happenstance  she stumbles into the club and finds him he plays a solo piano song and she has a dream where their entire love affair is relived only all the choices which led to their separation are made differently and they stay together and have a family and discover their dreams as a couple suddenly she understands what his words meant so long ago  about the history of jazz  the poetry of the musician  now everything comes full circle  and they have a longing final glance this is all cool  dont get me wrong but the story itself has been told so many times its clichs are even clichd the songs and dialogue are very uneven and at times the film is incoherently stupid really  do young couples talk about why they would sell out their dreams to make thousands of dollars a month also the big red flag with the story is that the music simply is not very good there is not one memorable song or dance in the entire film mostly the lights and costumes replace any real choreography or musical number with a unique visual cue also ryan gosling is poorly cast as a jazz pianist it just does not feel real at all that gosling is so so sad in la with his poor dreams of being a jazz pianist so hard to recognize as he dates lovely womenwhat exactly is the purpose of this film what was everyone singing and dancing about do we live in a world where people can fly down to la and pursue their dreams with a shot like yesteryear or do we live in a world where educational alliances corporate oligarchy family connections and the occasional marriage  determine who gets to shine in the lights are we as a people supposed to rejoice that the song and dance of old hollywood musicals had a tribute film made just in time for the oscar season i dunno  this movie does have some strong moments in the script  and it does have some good acting  costumes  and lights  but i just think its corny and i could not care less,happy
i love musicals but i must have missed the stand in the theater where they were handing our the koolaid for this one based on the hype i had high expectations i went in thinking would be like an american in paris or the bandwagon but once it started i realized it was more like one from the heart or everyone says i love you although both of those dismal failures had better music in this film ryan gosling plays a supercilious pianoplaying bore who endlessly pontificates about jazz emma stone plays his vapid love interest a starstruck barista who thinks she should be a movie star because she has a home filled with movie posters and her aunt once showed her casablanca once these two ciphers meet the audience is subjected the kind of dreary conversation one flees from in real lifethe musical score is deeply uninteresting emma and ryans hilltop dance is supposed to be reminiscent of fred astaire and cyd charisseginger rogers but comes closer to teri garr and raul julia in the aforementioned coppola disaster by the way the film completely fails to capture la in any waykudos to emma and ryan for trying to sing and dance unfortunately proving that it takes more talent than they or most other hollywood celebrities have to perform in a musical however i think that damien chazelle should be prevented from ever making another film musical if you insist on subjecting yourself to an excruciatingly bad musical try the apple which is a lot more fun and has better music to check out goodtogreat musicals see the movies that inspired the rko fred  ginger movies and the mgm musicals from the 30s through 50s even the recent straighttovideo lucky stiff leaves in the dust,happy
wow i just cannot believe all the accolades this movie is getting the only reason why it must be getting all these awards is that is is a movie about hollywood and hollywood loves itself very much the acting is vapid the dancing mediocre the songs forgettable the singing abysmal everyone sounds like a bad choir audition weak breathy without focus or ring no legit broadwaystyle singing technique i cannot imagine what real broadway singers and dancers must be thinking about this travestyi think it must be an exercise in navelgazing as the awards bodies see themselves in these two characters havent they all struggled to get auditions havent they all had screen tests havent they all tried to make it in hollywood of course they have the awards givers like looking at themselves in the mirror personally i do not like what they see dont bother wasting your energy or you will quit halfway through as i did 0 out of 10,happy
this film will disappoint you here are the reasons why1 its apparently supposed to be a movie musical yet both ryan gosling and emma stone are below average singers i couldnt quite get past this point it is astonishing that two below par singers could be casted in a movie musical it is a heavy contradiction to the genre of film it attempts to portray2 both ryan gosling and emma stone are below average dancers similar to the singing complaint i was unable to be captivated and fully immerse myself in the moviemusical magic because i was too busy cringing at their dance performance3 the storyline was not captivating boy meets girl girl meets boy because of respective careers they dont end up together fin4 the storyline went flat in the middle the middle of the film dragged for obvious reasons which is that the story line was to weak to maintain the intensity5 ryan goslings character is actually very annoying a jazz fanatic that forces it down everybodys throat including the girl he is dating he was superior to others because of his love for jazz he thrust jazz upon her and because of that i never really for once believed in the film that she had organically grown to love jazz as her love for him also developed instead it seemed as if she had to pretend to like jazz as a pre condition to their relationship6 the hype around this film does not match the quality of the film the expectations were simply way to high for this average film i mean it has 86 on imdb for goodness sakealthough it is subjective in my opinion this film comes nowhere close to a great film or musical in conclusion shame on hollywood and so many once respected critics endorsing this film as one of if not the greatest musicals of all time furthermore shame on movie lovers and society in general not having the balls to suggest the clear truth which is that this is clearly a very average film at best big shame,happy
i was greatly looking forward to this moviei had read many reviews and  they all seemed very positivein fact when i read my newspapers  critique is was given 44 which is unusual how let down i am this was  the worst movie i have seen this yearand we saw it in a vip theatreit  was so slow moving that i felt myself falling asleep i kept looking at  my watch saying only another 12 hour ryan gosling cannot really  sing  danceand emma stone may be very photogenic  a good actress but  she also is not much of a singerdancerthere are wonderful musicals  such as the amazing west side storythe wonderful grease chicago  was terrific to watch also as well as hairspray with jennifer hudson   mama mia with meryl streepbut this mess was a dud the plot was  simple but its execution was a dismal failurei cannot figure out all  the accolades this movie is getting from the golden globescritics  user reviews a few hours after this filmi cant really remember  anything worthwhiledo not waste your money on this film whatever the  critics sayit is boringnon believable you wont really care about  the characters,happy
sorry but i grew up living and loving musicals but this is tripe none of the stars are of the expected style or standard the story is grotesquely poor and without logic gosling is pathetic i kept wanting someone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands stones voice left me praying for a good dose of pharyngitis in short neither can sing or dance yet the hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it is and people believe it in short i wasted 2 hours 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life for our australian summer releases it rates nearly as bad as passengersdont bother wasting the ticket money,happy
a old couple left 30 minutes in i couldnt understand the music i couldnt hear the lyrics ryan goslings character was a dick for 90 of the movie he is a good actor but my goodness his character is an ass hat the story to me was blah it was like ive see this story told before just differently emma stone is amazing i definitely enjoyed her more than ryans character but that honestly isnt too hard the movie seemed pretentious and over rated as a whole it was just hollywood getting off on hollywood imagine if hollywood was a person and cloned themselves then hollywood starts sucking hollywoods dick there thats most of the story white man tries to save jazz i did enjoy the visuals editing colours and dancing so it was nice to look at ill give it that but the story to me was under whelming,happy
well done the marketing department for creating a buzz around this film the first comments i read in the newspapers said this was an uplifting life affirming experience so how come my husband and i left the cinema feeling thoroughly depressed with the ending the film was slow boring and didnt have much to say the opening sequence looked promising but turned out to be an unconnected piece of entertainment that wasnt repeated in the movie it was left to stone and gosling to stumble along with short bits of dancing and very shaky vocals didnt detect any magical reaction from the audience who shuffled out in silence dont believe the hype this is a just ok film probably a 54 rating would be nearer the truth,happy
you know when youre watching a film that you just dont want to end and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then i had that feeling with the new film from damien chazelle who blew us all away with whiplash a few years agowith chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedydrama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears if you havent heard of this film yet where have you been im sure you will do in the coming monthsmia dolan emma stone is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while sebastian wilder ryan gosling is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet the two meet and fall in love but its their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apartthe most striking thing about is just how beautifully crafted a film it is the story performances music dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience i genuinely cant find one single fault in this filmchazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy the whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying the gorgeous cinematography from linus sandgren brings the city of los angeles to life awash with colour while his swift camerawork including some impressive long takes in particular through the dance numbers immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musicalcoming to the performances features two superb lead performances from ryan gosling and emma stone both giving arguably their best performance to date gosling has really grown on me as an actor maturing into one of the best in the business today he proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in the nice guys and he proves it yet again here stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in singing and dancing her way into our hearts the pair share an undeniable chemistry and i would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards seasonjustin hurwitzs score and the original songs in along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film heighten the films level of originality maintaining that energy chapelles films possessi dare you to try and not fall in love with i fell in love with it and im sure many more will do so too,happy
while looking forward to seeing this film but having no real expectations the film was excruciatingly painful to sit through and i like musicals being a former film studenti found this film slow boring uneventful and at least an hour too long with unappealing characters at a point in the film ryan goslings character looks out over la and says not much to look at i said to my wife my thoughts exactly referring to the filmnot la this made musicals like lost horizon and at long last love look like cinematic greatness and i enjoyed those they certainly dont make them like they used to,happy
big spoiler alert was looking forward to this film but had to watch in agony from its beginning as a pepsi commercial to its ending as a coca cola commercial shocking that this pallid film is being feted for something it is not emma stone someone who is hard to watch in long extreme closeups throughout the film and ryan gosling exhibit no charisma or charm their dancing tries to be cute and romantic but is clumsy the music is dirgelike and not uplifting the producers should have used more professional musical performers ones who can inspire when they sing andor dance gosling talks about jazz throughout the film but we hardly hear any good jazz especially not the jazz greats he talks about so how are we to know what is the great jazz that inspired him his friend says jazz is the future but in reality its the present being created as its played all of a sudden stone the aspiring actress who shows no acting talent whatsoever decides to become a playwright without showing any ability or work except for having an apartment covered with photos of classic movie stars the banal dialogue superficial characters and overly long scenes are embarrassments stone comes into her old coffee shop and asks for two iced coffees immediately a guy standing there puts down a tray with two iced coffees in front of her glaring continuity problem there throughout the film in almost every scene there is nary a person who is over thirty the casting people never cared to hire people who reflected the real world fantasy or not if the music had been tuneful and clever the film would be somewhat better as it is it is dull he characters exist in a vacuum with no backstory only interesting aspect to this film is some of the recognizable hollywood locations but locations do not a film make if anyone still watches the selfaggrandizing academy awards it will be cringeworthy if this film wins any awards except for production manager or art director its a sad state of affairs that this film is considered in high esteem that accolade belongs to singin in the rain the band wagon gigi oklahomasouth pacific top hatwizard of oz and films by astaire kelly powell miller charisse garland crosby sinatra grable keel and all the great stars who truly were musical comedy class acts their talents made even b films a joy to watch,happy
tone of the movie wavers between serious and quirky never making a definitive choice as such it succeeds at neither far too many homages to other movies to stand on its own tries to play on la stereotypes but the commentary on them only comes across as making sure each clich is thrown in the movie somewhere thereby ensuring that the movie itself exemplifies the most prevalent la stereotype style over substance liked the alternate reality sequence if only for the fact that it was the one moment in the movie where it tried to say something interesting about life and because i could pretend to be in some other reality where i wasnt watching this movie,happy
an observatory a boulevard a bridge a downtown trolley all make up filming locations of the new film these locations are iconic yet remain unnamed throughout the film the sum of these locations create the city of los angeles any meaningful production is a sum of its cast members and in the case of there is no difference sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone come together to create a wonderful production but a lesser known yet ever present cast member is the city itself throughout the epic musical sequences the city in its whole is either visible or represented by its historic street lights some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the songs and dancing of sebastian and mia but the city itself takes center stage with the vibrancy of a leading man it lends its beauty to be danced upon by sebastian and mia without relinquishing its hold as being the center of attention mia being a minor actress in hollywood goes to casting calls where those auditioning look the same this image of hollywood conformity lends itself to the character of sebastian who has to change his performance identity much in the same way mia has done in order to fit in and make a living in the beast that is hollywood with this being said the performances of mia and sebastian are one of a kind lending itself to a sort of fantasy adaptation of falling in love the imagery of the film stops at nothing to convey the idea of love and the concept of a soulmate while the business aspects of hollywood coupled with the necessity of survival keeps the two characters at odds the film represents a city a city that often times is at odds with itself a city that identifies talent based on familiarity rather than the unique and often overlooked aspects that create it ultimately is a story about conforming and not conforming and the gains that can be had in between la is marketed as the land of dreams yet is often overlooked and stacked on a pile of dreams that will never come to fruition the film explores the idea of what if and tackles the idea of a working hollywood versus a hollywood where the idea of art is paramount focuses on the idea of money versus art and shows that nobel aspects of creativity are often ignored to focus on the monetary aspects of the industry while leaving behind the very art that drove them in the first place the movie is very much paced in the realm of hollywood where the cadence of the film is action packed with all the fervor of a young person entering hollywood for the first time yet as mia and sebastian learn the interworkings of hollywood the film slows down to reflect the realities that are faced when having to juggle income and art reignites a fire that has been lost from a hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots its refreshing to see a totally unique film especially one that grasps the nature of hollywood and los angeles in such an unconventional way the singing the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life the long musical sequences often border on the surreal taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring this is quickly remedied but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing watching is like being awake during a wondrous dream there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between mia and sebastian as well as the visuals of los angeles that surround them as he sits at his piano sebastian sweetly and softly sings mia a love song a powerful couple of lines that represent love art and life city of stars are you shining just for me city of stars there so much that i can see who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new or one more dream that i cannot make true with a dream has come true and made its way onto the big screen,happy
what a great movie who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead yet here it is hale and heartythe music is melodic but never simplistic the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible the script is funny touching without ever resorting to sentimentality the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that i honestly thought had disappeared entirely from american movies but here we have ryan gosling and emma stone just oozing itthe only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and overreliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light but thats me being really picky it may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since seven brides for seven brothersall credit to writerdirector damien chazelle and his team  and it really feels like a teammovie  for giving us this gem sure its a feelgood piece but it creates a world which is complex it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters it connects with peoples passions and in the case of ms stones big solo audition it has a bona fide classic,happy
i went to this film with the expectation that i would be seeing a modern musical with a nostalgic twist this expectation was delivered but generally in a mediocre way the much touted opening number was a technically accomplished cinematographic feat but the setting and choreography was rather bland and boring i struggled to hear and care about the song for this numberi found the repartee between the two leads was a bit mumbled and not particularly witty or fun the dancing was very average and the songs and singing unmemorable mia and sebs theme was bland and not what you would expect a jazz enthusiast to come up with apart from the two leads there were no other memorable characters or performancesthere was never a moment when i felt joy watching any of the scenes which i suppose was the reason why i was most disappointed with the filma few interesting la landmarks were showcased in the film but again the interesting settings were not really exploited by the choreography for example mia andor seb could have danced on the round balcony at the observatory what you would have expected a fred or gene to have done if this was not allowed on the real balcony the balcony could have been recreated on a setryan gosling did not convey any great passion for either jazz or mia most of his facial expressions made it seem that he was a martyr to mild indigestion he spoke a lot about his passions but you need to show this cinematicallyi enjoyed emma stones performance much more some of her audition scenes were good and her performance of her last audition song was good i thought the song itself was just okto summarize one of the few films that i was tempted to walk out on but i was in the middle of a row and one that i will never be tempted to watch again,happy
the new hollywood musical with the intriguing title one of the most talked about motion pictures in recent years with two of hollywoods most attractive and popular younger generation stars ryan gosling and emma stone can best be summed up in a single three syllable word  pathetic gosling in spite of a name that makes one think of goose liver is indeed quite handsome in the traditional hollywood leading man mold but when it comes to acting or personality he is no cary grant or jimmy dean and as far as dancing goes he couldnt carry the jock strap of either gene kelly or fred astaire his love interest and dancing partner emma stone a lissome skinny redhead with gigantic blue eyes and no breasts to speak of is a much better dancer and generally a far better actor but seems to have aged considerably since her extraordinarily vivid interpretation of a sexy young college coed in love with her murderous philosophy prof in woody allens irrational man just two years ago in this picture she is in facial closeup much of the time but looks haggard worn and older than she is supposed to according to the story the dance numbers seem to be an attempt at a homage to astaire and ginger rogers in slow motion but they are so badly set and choreographed that after a while they just become annoying one particular gosling stone duet set in the la planetarium is so ridiculous with them antigravitationally traipsing on thin air against a galaxy of stars that it is downright embarrassing the young lovers are clearly meant for each other but their divergent career dreams and aspirations she as an actress he as a charley parker type serious jazz musician keep them apart in the wake of arbitrary script manipulations that seem so phony you get the feeling the actors had to keep asking themselves hold on a sec what were we supposed to be doing in that last scene pathetic scripting pathetic unmotivated dance scenes arbitrarily inserted then ineptly executed  pathetic unfocused direction  no wonder mia stone and sebastian gosling have such pained expressions on their pretty faces all the time i actually felt sorry for emma in some scenes suspecting that she may have been physically unwell while going through the motions i kept looking at my watch wondering if this thing was ever going to end the running time was 128 minutes but it felt more like five hours the final credits with handsome artdeco lettering were a great relief when they finally came up and put this picture out if its misery no more damien chazelle for me he also directed another sadomasochistic abomination entitled whiplash give me mondo cane  bottom line a film almost as dopey as its dumbbell ladeeda title,happy
a film that fails the turing test  in reverse or something what i mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled over me that i was participating in a rather sinister experiment watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting to provoke a humanlike response stuffed with algorithms culled from proper movies and musicals the computer has generated a script and a set of scenarios based on userpreference and targeted directly at my very own demographic its eerie the songs sound like songs but arent quite the dialogue sounds like people but not quite nothing that happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the plot the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isnt quite and the setups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me untouched and feeling slightly hollow what has been thrown hurled and heaved at this film is oscarseeking acting oscarseeking direction and oscarseeking technical twiddling and hey ho and guess what it got oscars its the apotheosis of junk food finally you dont even need to make the effort to chew it can now just squirt directly into you via the eyes and ears a simulacrum of nourishment overflavoured glop taking the name of real love real music real acting and real life in vain,happy
my summary basically says it all i had so been looking forward to seeing this movie particularly as l love musicals  but am sad to say that i was hugely disappointed it started brightly enough with the traffic jam dance scene  but from there on in it was all downhill for me i felt the whole film was terribly disjointed and it felt like they were trying too hard to recreate the magical musicals of years gone by the singing was poor  and the dancing  if you could call it that  equally uninspiring some reviewers have even gushed about this being one of the greatest musicals of alltime what have they never seen west side story grease or any of the old hollywood greats obviously no otherwise they would never have made such a stupid statement for me this was 2 hours of zzzzzzz,happy
im sorry but i just dont get the adulation for this very bland very boring musical i watched it with a lot of anticipation with my partner and both she and i were bored enough to consider giving upthe opening sequence was like a james bond opening sequence it had nothing to do with the actual film and was the best partim a very big musical fan and its difficult to think of one i havent seen this one has an original score and isnt a film version of a broadway musical so should not be compared too closely to films like mamma mia or les miserables but can be compared to singing in the rain high society and to a certain extent sound of music my fair lady cabaret etc which were produced in an age where theatregoing was a rich persons pastimein every comparison this film fails the music is insipid and totally forgettable the acting is ok but the main characters dancing would not have got them past week two of strictly come dancing the biggest fault with the movie is the complete lack of supporting actors to flesh out the story the two main characters are just not strong enough to carry the movie for more than two hours without help im talking about actors like anne hathaway les mis joel grey cabaret stockard channing grease george chakiris west side story donald oconner singing in the rain the list goes on and on in this film all we got were cameos by john legend and a totally wasted j k simmons would love to have seen him sing and danceso sorry for being a spoilsport but i just cannot see what all the fuss is about,happy
bottomline once upon a time there was the american musical which could inspire the world by wielding great visuals music story and characters today we have the perfect lobotomy instrument called i began theorizing that it would only be possible to understand the praise and delight of the general populace if lobotomy would have been performed on a universal scale i know not of any such undertaking and im no fan of conspiracy theories alas i have to assume that there are shortcomings of mine which do not let me enjoy this so called jewel of a movie which purportedly restores the glamour of the golden era of hollywoodplus points 1 pretty emma stone who can actminus points 1 emma stone cant sing 2 emma stone cant dance too well 3 ryan gosling cant sing or dance 4 weak plot delivered in a unbelievable manner 5 silly and overused musical score 6 uninteresting dialogue 7 no character depth and actually no chemistry between the two protagonists overall feel to the movie was that of silliness beyond measure my personal reaction was that of uncontrolled roaring laughter it is strange indeed that while i cried at the funny moments i laughed at the sad and serious moments i have to admit that rarely have i laughed this way during a movie the ratings and nominations are oftentimes so unfair to real cinematic talent that i had to give a 1 one mark for the balance it is really sad that the renaissance of the american musical is trumpeted by this hollow shell of a movie,happy
in whiplash chazelles first feature excellent cinematography editing music and design combined with great acting and gripping scenes however it was marred by some serious disconnects with realism while purporting to be essentially realistic some of the character psychologies and story logic were stretched too thin ultimately one could enjoy the acting and the editshot rhythms and forgive the flawsthose same flaws from his first picture absolutely devastate and they arent counterbalanced by much more than two very good set pieces gosling and stones number while he walks her to her car and stones audition numberthere is not an interesting conflict in a scene for the first ninety minutes of this movie much of the early tension is based on two goodlooking characters who dont like each other and on them coincidentally running into each other a few times all of the later conflict between the two main characters hinges on conveniently concocted scene logic that boils down to fighting and breaking up instead of simple solutions like a sending a text or b getting out of a work thing or c saying ill see you in a few months the logic flaws and wholly unearned story points are so bad that its not really a story its more of a unpolished frame to hang a bunch of set pieces on it intends to be a string of pearlsbut when half of those set pieces are mediocre particularly the opening number one is left with uncomfortable waits between the good parts the story and characters are nothing and half of the scenes neither deepen the story nor wholly delight it makes you aware of your butt on the chair in the theatermaybe worst of all is this movies attempt to do with motion blur what easy rider did with lens flares the difference is that avoid lens flares was just a rule about professional cinematography that was broken by a few rebels in the right movie for that motion blur is a fairly upsetting thing to look at let alone on a big screen for shots that last two or three seconds repeated seven or eight times in the movie one of them is quite effective up to some palm trees 180 degree twist and back down to the leads as they walk around a fountain and there are some simple whip pans that are too fast to be upsetting but this leaves multiple mediumspeed motion blur pans and the movie loses more than it could gain multiple times by breaking this rule if you feel that there is no rule that says not to do long motionblur shots when they dont add anything ill grant you your point and counter by saying that the movie looks hideous and nauseating during those shots,happy
this movie is not good the high reviews are probably studio people or friends and family of all the cast  crew involved in this film i really like both emma stone and ryan gosling but neither can carry a tune in this movie im not saying these two needed to be shirley jones and frank sinatra but at least find 2 people that can sing we know emmy rossum can sing and they could have cast patrick wilson for a musical its not just star power the leads have to be able to sing or at least dub some beautiful voice in like they did for natalie wood in west side storyplus the story is quite boring and very slow girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy yawn then theres the issue of maybe only one semicatchy tune add that to the boring story and youve got yourself a snoozefest which no self respecting musical should ever be jk simmons is really good in the 23 minutes hes in the movie but no one else is even remotely memorable in a role any male actor could have played they waste tom everett scott by the way the opening production number is very clever but the song is not good by any means ive already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song the story isnt worth summarizing here as its too boring to repeat very very disappointing dont waste your money and wait for it to hit cable,happy
ive never been more disappointed in a film than i have with the trailer had me completely sucked in and i couldnt wait to see it at the cinema however this film is an hour too long had practically no story and was so boring to watch my mom was asleep after 10 minutes not just that but all the singers in the film were far too weak gosling and stone didnt have powerful enough voices to carry off the lead parts john legend had the best voice by far but his part was so small it didnt make a difference to the film as a whole not good at all if you do go to see this dont believe all the hype and go in with low expectations88 on imdb what a joke,happy
this movie won awards and praised by some so the chances are that you are going to see it eventuallyas a musical it lacks good music and good choreography it draws inspiration by classics like singing in the rain and west side story but it cant compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesnt offer anything new in the genrein terms of acting emma stone is very good showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from ryan gosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reachthe plot it starts as a satire of todays and past and maybe future los angeles which is full of waitresses who want to be famous actresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make it in a very competitive worldlater it becomes a romantic story not only for relationships but also for dreams and wishes but in its final act the movie takes a serious dramatic turn where the two happy endings are combining to a depressing conclusion that even the final two reassuring nods cant repair add to this an alternate timeline flashback that the directorwriter wanted to incorporate to his vision and you end up with an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimistic feeling and the romance that initially hadoverall depressing mediocre forgettable music a classic story that ends up in a melancholic yet pragmatical way,happy
a stone cold performance from emma and the goose is cooked where ryan is concerned any attempts to recreate the chemistry of socalled hollywood golden classics it attempts to emulate are a weak fizz slow and contrived the plot is weaker than a cup of tea made from a tenth dunk of the bag an imminently forgettable score appears built around one pleasant enough motif but is bashed beyond compare there is richness in the jazz that underpins it all but much like its syncopated rhythms this one misses the beat no more so than in the much hyped opening scene i was hoping someone might get some road rage and move the story onthe critical hype is clearly written by those with their heads firmly placed in,happy
i went to see the movie because it was 87 in imdb and somebody said its the best movie he has seen since star wars when he was 6 well we were 2 couples and we left after 30 minutesits an awful movieif you are not into musicals and if you liked whiplash do yourself a favor take a good book and stay homeits boring the plot is dull it is slow and the opposite of inspiring or interesting the beginning of the movie has a scene as if inspired by west side story but this is not leonard bernstein and the music does not meet the level yet i thought its a good startat some point it becomes more interesting and something is happening but then it is cut and slowed down by a romantic song in the middle of some action and the movie falls down againthis movie does not deserve to be in the top 100 of imdb help me to take it down you will thank me for the warning,happy
if a producer is going to deconstruct a genre the producer owes it to the audience to warn them early on like in purple rose of cairo or unforgiven this film which has been lavishly praised earns my visceral hatred because it did not do so and i frankly cannot recall a movie which has ever triggered that sort of reaction even though i have seen thousands of themi went to this movie because i was in the mood for a warm feel good movie the promos and a goodly part of the film deliver that feel good warmth like the artist but this time as an updated classic songanddance film of the 1930s to 1950s you can also see the homages like those to astairerodgers and kelly as well as a knowing glance to a key scene in rebel without a cause sounds just like what i wantedbut about twothirds of the way through something begins to change no spoilers here the crack widens until the end which at least one review has called bittersweet for me i felt rage i got conned without warning into seeing the kind of movie i did not want to see so you bet im angry in terms of the mechanics the film does not quite follow the basic lines of an early songanddance musical invariably there is a secondary subplot involving different characters who depending on the film build tension contrast or comic relief none of that existed here although there were some opportunities which never bore fruit perhaps some more false leads by the writer i saw them as distracting dead endsthere are also a number of plot holes which are annoying a couple of which involve cell phones and unexchanged cell phone numbers that would have happened in real life any musical expects people to suspend disbelief but the suspension of disbelief is generally in the musical parts not the narrativetwo of the best parts of the movie were the acting by the two leads excellent they were also game at the singing and dancing and clearly worked darn hard to do a great job but to be honest goslings singing a presumed effort to mimic astaires approach was not good and stones dancing didnt hold a candle to a really trained talented dancer like the lead in the opening number you can make musicals which have twists like the ending in west side story but they dont pretend to be homagesthey make it clear up front they are something different so for ruining my sunday afternoon i give this movie a 1,happy
i usually dont write reviews but i felt in this case i had to having seen so many reviews and people raging about how wonderful this film is i truly hate to say it but oh how wrong they are firstly as actors and people i enjoy ryan and emmas work i think they are both incredibly talented and work well together however their styles and talents were not suitable for this movie this was a musicali would expect the actors to be better than subpar singers the dancing element albeit abrupt and highly unnecessary in many cases was well done the routines were quite abstract and i enjoyed them the story line was nothing more than predictable and in the end rather disappointing i saw this movie with friends and the only reason why we didnt walk out was simply out of worry that one of us was enjoying it we werent there are no words i can use to recommend you to see this film  as i would be lying if i didplease dont waste your money  it is a cross between a low budget mama mia and a rather terrible hallmark movie,happy
saying that this film is a musical is like saying the martian is a comedy i found the film extremely slow moving and it did not hold my attention the story line was weak and it had me hoping it would improve it did not improve and i walked out with about 40 minutes of the film remaining considering the exceptional reviews and ratings this film has been getting i was sorely disappointed films like singing in the rain are musicals this is not even a fraction of a musical i am an avid film goer and consider that i have enough musical knowledge coming from a musical background to give such judgments i notice one other reviewer stated this could be classed as a poor mans woody allen film and i totally agree last year i saw the cafe society and this had far greater costumes acting depth and music ,happy
ok it is a 6ish movie but look at the ratings the rating totally misleads the audiences and i dont think a good movie maker should do that if you want to make a 9star movie make it not fake itthe movie has the unbelievable boring start and this lasts for 23 of the movie the whole movie hardly has any story so dont expect any amazing story or something there is none just couple fall in love had one fight and separates the movie deserves a 6 because it is really good at sharing the lovers feelings but one good thing doesnt make it a 9 star for sureplease do not cheat the audiences,happy
this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i cannot understand people who are raving about this film saying its one of best ever heard of shawhsank redmemption la confidential godfather and dont get me wrong i like musicals mary poppins sound of music are terrific but this i wanted to run out after half an hour whiplash was ok and far better than this nonsense dont waste your time i am a jazz musician so naturally im critical of the music there was nothing memorable about any of the tunes i am also a huge ryan gosling fan but he was totally wasted in this part we went to this film with a few other couples and the the best review one of us gave was that it was ok,happy
spoilers spoilers spoilersif you havent seen it yet dont read thisokay first of all i dint want to see this movie from the little things i heard i saw it looked like the typical musical same as all others musicals as clichd as it could get and boringbut many of my friends wanted to see it and i said hey maybe it could be watchablewell it wasntit starts with this hideous musical piece with the friends of emma stone dancing and it looked like gleeretarted and emptythe next songs wasnt that bad but still not good at all boring the usual musical songs that youd expect to here stuck in a 50s or whatever the era was aesthetics even though it is freaking 2017 the choreographic the same thing that takes you back many decades and has absolutely nothing to add to the present in the dancing scene in the hill the 2 main characters could barely lift their feet from the ground and that looked really lame the plot was no different than that of a thousand other romantic drama comedy and musical movies that exist the movie is 2 hours 8 minutes long but it felt like 4 hours toni erdmann is 2h 40 min and it felt like a 1 hour moviei really wanted to leave the cinema because it was so boring and its parts didnt add together i felt like i was watching 4 movies put together in a very sloppy and in a way that didnt make a bit of sense near the end were emma stone sang for an audition me and my friends laughed our ass off because she was lisping a lotwe were literary crying from laughter also i dont think you can call it a musical because it had like 10 minutes of singing and dancingto sum up a borefest as stereotyped as a movie can get its so bad so nonsensical that many times feels like a parody or a comedy the dialogue is really awful very bad music choreography is lame costumes are a tribute to these of many decades ago and the ones emma stone wore looked like the ones you buy from cheap chinese stores and finally the plot didnt make any sense and even if it did its so corny that it seems that a 15 year old girl wrote just dont watch this thing jesus,happy
disappointing definitely not worth the acclaim its getting i love emma stone and gosling though both great actors however they cant sing which make it sometimes a bit painful also you start with a very american style movie with all the flowers the group singing the happiness the dancing and jumping so i guess you expect a movie that is going to at least end on a positive note well it doesnt and i dont think that separating the 2 lovers at the end brings anything special to the movie either you focus on the story line and you make it interesting moving fun and then you can create a bit of a drama at the end however everything was to be expected from beginning to the end so please give the spectator at least a bit of relief and lets them be happy together with a kid its a shame it could have been great ,happy
thought this would be a dandy new years film just days before when debbie reynolds passed away i spent time watching the classic dancesong numbers in singin in the rain yes the films opening number was a fine homage to musicals of the golden age then i could not help but compare ryan and emmas lack luster amateur dance efforts to the amazing talents of such as debbie donald and gene kelly blah versus excellence next i had to endure ryan trying to sing total failure emma a notch better but again not ready for prime time no one left the theater humming anything close to an unforgettable tune time for me to again start humming singin in the rainthe story moved at snails pace for the most part a major plot whole when a character makes a major life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which of course made no sensefinally many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between ryan and emmato vote anything close to an 89 you need memorable songs great chemistry ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself sadly i found all these qualities totally lacking,happy
i have an eclectic taste in films so am not averse to a good musical  especially with impressive dance routines west side story is one of my favourites with brilliant songs choreography and a powerful story mama mia was superbly acted and sung and loads of fun but lala land is so stale dated and tacky ok so there are some talented performers in it but the story line is shallow and trite and the music is so dated  they deserved a much better script than this it might be considered to be a tribute to old style hollywood by some but singing in the rain it aint its not even close to that standard i was bitterly disappointed and have no idea why it has won so many awards i truly regret the time and money i spent going to see it,happy
i dont usually write negative reviews but since this movie is stealing all the awards so far and some people are calling that dull  cheesy film a masterpiece i felt forced to write something lll is a movie made from plastic it is full of clichs and a it has a fake aroma of nostalgiathe beginning does have neither weight nor meaning the director only wants to tell us here in case we dont notice afterwards that this movie is a musical good for him because who could have guessed that with all the bad singing and the bad dancingthe love story is completely predictable and fake for the first hour or so until the first fightsomebody has said that this film is a superwhite film about 2 babydreamers and i completely agree where is the art where is the real struggle there are today millions of people dying from hunger wars violence and incurable diseases and to sink because a play didnt turn out how you expected or you cannot be the jazz pianist number one is really childish good things the cinematography and the flashbacks are very good the end is the best that turn is actually original but does not make any sense any way lets not forget that the girl and the boy are where they are because she was depressed for her career failure so the turn does not actually make any sense the jazz is good too i mean the real jazz musicians and ryan gosling who is ok in the film but not amazing is actually playing the piano which in a hollywood movie is already a lot annoying things the worst is in my opinion emma stone i never understood her talent she is just a pretty face with a skinny anorexic body who seems to think she is too good to prepare for her roles her singing  dancing are awful lets remember that in irrational man i love woody allen she didnt even bother taking a piano lesson for her role of pianist her hairdo is very annoying she always seems to have just come out from the hairdresser and i never understood why she cannot appear in even one frame without make up how this mediocre actress won the golden globe for bp by an actress in a mp  musical or comedy in stead of the amazing meryl streep or the amazing annette bening shows how hollywood is losing it and the fact that she won the sag award outstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role in stead of meryl streep or natalie portman shows how this movie has blinded hollywood the most hilarious thing would be that she wins the oscar and sadly she probably will being in the same category as ruth negga who made an stunning performance in loving meryl streep always amazing and always great natalie portman and isabelle huppert one of the best european actresses of today but hey if sandra bullock got and oscar in 2010 stone could definitely get one toogosling can play the piano but he definitely cannot sing his voice does not have any power and it sounds like olive oil his dancing is as his partners mediocre how come he ended wining the golden globe for bp by an actor in a mp  musical or comedy in stead of hugh grant who gave his best performance ever in ffj is a real mystery luckily and for the sake of art he didnt get the sag award who went to the amazing denzel the clichs of lll are endless girl meets boy and at first they hate each other but after they like each other the detail with the famous actress who enters in the caf is also predictable and how rude not cool is to refuse an invitation there are lots of holes in the movie boy and girl keep bumping into each other in a city as huge as la and many more but i am not going to tell them because i dont want to reveal the plot and turns of the movie 14 oscar nominations give me a break as somebody said its the endless story about hollywood in love with itself pity i will definitely not watch the oscars this year there were lots of really great movies this year and they did not get 14 oscar nominations collateral beauty loving hidden figures lion moonlight elle florence foster jenkins smrt u sarajevu fences lll should have got 1 oscar nomination only cinematography sandgrenthe whole movie even if it features some great black jazz musicians has a whiteish taste that is unbearable i dont care at all if the actors are white black yellow orange or green but this cheesy movie with 2 black actors definitely wouldnt have got 14 oscars nominations why because from the 6000 academy members 73 are men 27 women 89 are white and only 11 are people of color the age average is 60 years old that can explain the love for this mediocre musical i would not call it a musical because in the musicals the actors actually know to sing and know to dance the world is sadly still very racist thats why many people are calling this film white white land for a reason that lll is stealing all the awards and probably will also steal many oscars shows the decadency of cinema today in the us either that or people are really bored and need an empty and cheesy love story to be entertained i think that hollywood should learn from that reality that european cinema knows to depict away from clichs and empty love stories away from pretty actors with fake hairdos and plastic bodies if lll has achieved something is that a new line of decadence clichs and cheesiness in american cinema,happy
this film starts with a great promise we follow a musician and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love in los angeles the films title is a reference both to a nickname for the city of los angeles and to the idiom for being out of touch with reality but where it fails it all the rest the movie is well acted no doubt but the subject you care less and less and even if you want to this film is a 90 minutes romantic comedy that turns out to be 130 even woody allen will think its too much i want the shorter version i was bored to death and im a huge fan of ryan gosling and emma stone work here i try but cant  its just too long ,happy
well i give this movie 510 but i give the lowest note here because i cant believe it has 8710 from people this movie is boring it is just a crap it is a bad movie the plot doesnt have any sense the graphiceffects are poor stones smiles and eyes are ugly but shes a decent actress gosling is a bad actor he has one smile on his face during the entire movie a smile of a poor dog they sing only few songs and they dont even sing stone moans gosling mumbles i cant believe it receives golden globes i cant believe gosling and stone won for best actors its patheticif you want to see it  please dont,happy
is certainly the most hyped film of the year maybe its a film for people who dont like musicals or have never seen a really great musical film as much as i like both ryan gosling and emma stone neither of them can sing or dance well enough to star in a musical its mind boggling to think of all of the talented men and women on broadway who could have really nailed these roles the opening musical sequence is embarrassing and way too long  kept looking down to avoid watching the screen also much of the plot is a rehash of another crummy musical new york new york 1977 at least that one had liza minnelli to sort of save the day whenever she started singing the ending especially is the same downer it doesnt workso catch this on a rental if youre curious but it was not enjoyable will probably win all kinds of academy awards knowing hollywood  its that bad,happy
i went to see this movie only because of all the oscar nominations but when it turned out to be so cheesy that i would send it back if it was a pizza id ordered i read the fan reviews hoping somebody would explain what i had missed none do but ive learned something i had not wanted to know about imdb reviews musicals like annie and grease understood that there needs to be a plot line between the songs and some songs should be decent enough to not need a movie to sell them unfortunately was only created to prove mel gibsons paranoia about hollywood correct the racist screenwriters wanted to ensure we all knew that they thought the teacher in the movie dangerous minds was too nice they hammer on this twice in the movie they then try to hide their racism behind portrayal of the main character having black friends and liking jazz but only long enough to end the movie with a drawn out scene about this same character deciding he was wrong about those choices and regretting that he ever made any black friends somehow hollywoods elite thought this message was more important than reminding americans about a forgotten war hero who singlehandedly saved nearly a hundred american lives on the battlefield in wwii or the true story of an indian boys struggles to find his family,happy
did someone say last years oscars were too white  so lets award most of this years oscars to something that looks like an explosion in a paint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen  was being touted as the film to beat even before most of the other contenders were announced and its domination at the golden globes confirmed everything  looks like the 2017 oscars will be the most predictable event of this year romantic musicals arent my thing so my dread was realised in the opening scene with a california highway turning in to a song and dance scene so camp i thought i was watching a forest of pink tents which hints at what youre going to get  feelgood factor whether you want it or not  it was at this point i seriously considered giving up on the movie and going on youtube to listen to proper love songs by the likes of the the and joy division as the film continued the narrative did expose itself to being what you expect  two young people  a man and a woman  who are embarking on fulfilling their careers in respectively jazz music and acting  theres not a lot here we havent seen before but what sells this movie is the visual work director damien chazelle has put in to it  the language of cinema is very much to the fore especially the stunning cinematography and my abiding memory is the scene where the two protagonists meet and an impact aesthetic is instantly created by the way the lighting changes  many scenes are similarity beautiful but if theres a fundamental problem remains that no matter how well made a film is if youve no interest in the genre then you wont become a convert  as it stands will dominate the oscars like the french film the artist did five years ago then become quickly forgotten,happy
i really wanted to like this movie it had so much potential but its a lack of everything it wanted to be first i like both actors i really dobut i dont think they did justice to dancing or singingit simply didnt look real or serious enougheither theyre not talented enough or they shouldve work harder and longer for itim not a professional dancer but you can see from the sky that the way they move their feet isnt real dancers alike idea of bringing old hollywood style step dancing and singing is brilliant but there is no much storyscenario is somehow cheapjohn legend i love your musicbut casting him was more desperate than necessarythe buzz over this movie is just so overhyped theyre even mentioning oscar nominations which it obviously doesnt deserveyou simply cant put this next to titanicthe lord of the rings or i dont know brave heart or gladiator categoryit takes a better storyit needs to be more originalmore breathtakingit needs to to give you goosebumps and be something to remember there isnt much to tell about this moviecause even tho it wanted  this movie simply doesnt give enough im sorry but its six from me,happy
sorry i had to give it a 1 to counter the people who gave this a 10my wife and i went to see this movie based on ratings it isnt really a very good anything it had no memorable songs it didnt have any singers to mention sorry the main actors are not singersthe drama part may have been the best where we find that following your dream takes away from real people and real relationships so in that way it was sad so sadcalling this a comedy is wrong only once in the theater did i hear others laughing and that was only for a brief moment maybe is was the kind of people in the audience my wife and i were talking about where is peewee herman and the two guys in front of us told us to shush during where ryan was whistling on the pier really did we take away from the whistle sound track that much guys dont think i missed the two times the piano was not played correctly either however one of the grands was nicely tuned that may have been the best part of the movie you got to hear the difference between a real piano and an electronic one the real is always better as is real relationships are always better than following your own desires,happy
i went in expecting something wonderful like chicago or moulin rouge but instead was treated to mediocre at best the acting was good the sound was ok but there was nothing best about it i dont know how it was able to garner any oscar nominations there just wasnt anything oscar worthy about it it was trying to had to hearken back to the days of fred astaire and ginger rogers and failed miserably the singing wasnt that great either i like both of the star actors but this just wasnt the right vehicle for them their singing was just ok the songs were nothing memorable that i would want the sound track for the only really good song was the one sung by john legend the city of stars was a nice little ditty but that about it the whole movie from beginning to end was just underwhelming both my partner and i felt the same way walking out in fact his first words were well thats four hours well never get back i said it was only two hours he said exactly oh well i guess you cant like everything,happy
saw a week ago and i needed time to process how little impressed with it i ended up being it is a sparkly superwhite depiction of la in an utterly apolitical hipster way that scratches its soles to the beat of eras when most things were just that  selfcentered posh people having dreams it is underneath the personal story of two people trying to be something an embodiment of make film great again as the dictator down souths meanspirited and ignorant slogan about america itself is it is a throwaway film most certainly does not deserve any oscars and is actually quite forgettable except for the city of stars song the dancing isnt just off its terrible dare i say utterly lame emma stones charm only got me so far through this puffed up piece of cupcake dust the use of griffith observatory becomes goofier than even the worst parts of titanic arrival moonlight even manchester by the sea are far far superior films this of course means will win big time i enjoyed warcraft more seriously,happy
so first of all if there werent this much marketing about the movie if the movie hadnt won 6 oscars and if people around me didnt think so high of it i would have been fair and given a 3 or a 4 but when raising expectations this much it is just impossible to give a better grade than 1the movie is one of the most boring ive seen in the past years the first scene is sooo embarrassing i was so close to leave the theatre i should have the story line is flat it can be summarized in two linesis cheesy and unlyrical if you want to produce a musical teach your actors how to dance i mean an average dancer could probably do betterthe cinematography is supposed to be wow but to my eye they completely overuse the use of colours for me a good mise en place in a good movie is the one that your eyes like without you realizing which elements make it this way until you stare for a moment was too obvious to me the use of widescreen is hollow the whole thing is gimmickrywhile adding an old hollywood look to a modern day movie is original it just isnt my thing whats the purpose to connect to the old musicals he wishesalso a small detail why the hell is mias dressing so ugly,happy
i went to watch this movie as its getting lot of praise all around but i found it just an ok film in fact there were times i was looking over my watch when will this movie get over ryan gosling is attractive charming but in some scenes he gets expressionlessemma looks just average her acting is way better than ryan goslinghowever movie is colorful musical background track is also good music is superb but i expected a bit more on the story part overall i could not connect with this movie really think that i wasted my 2 hours and money on this movie,happy
this is simply the worst musical i have ever seen it was clear to my wife and i about 30 minutes into this that the actors director and composer where too young to remember or too young to understand the old musicals and just how much talent went into those productionsthe music was dreary and unmemorable the story was uneven and made little sense i think emma stone is a delightful actress but this was a huge overreach for her ryan gosling was stiff and bland as he is most of the timemy advice to people who gave this a 10 please go watchsingin in the rain  west side story  the wizard of oz  the sound of music  cabaret  mary poppins  a star is born  my fair lady  an american in paris  meet me in st louis  on the town  the band wagonstart with that line up  then come back and watch this rubbish and see if its still 10 stars,happy
i saw this movie because of all the oscar hype how can a movie have more oscar nominations than the godfather i read the negative reviews and wanted to make up my own mind the negative reviewers were absolutely right in time movie reviewers will look back on this movie as a 2017 aberration and wonder what were they thinking did someone put something in the water the plot is juvenile clich hollywood struggles about making it big grow up the plot reinforces racial stereotypes about the white guy being the purist and the black guys work for him what the the main characters cant sing or dance i had to stop myself from laughing what an insult to the greatness of past musical performers needs extensive editing so many unnecessary long pensive moments filler shots the special effects were so lame eg you could see emma stones harness bulking up her waistline couldnt make out the lyrics in the jumbled mess of the opening number contrived pause to allow the audience to applaud unrealistic coy behaviour of the two leads as they fall in love what the are they tweennies is this set in current times or not throughly absolutely forgettable,happy
we should give credit when its due but not when it doesnt deserve it damien chazelle did an excellent job in writing and directing the movie whiplash in 2014 but not so with in 2016this latest film was utter garbage and deserves less than a 110 it wasnt only painful for me to watch but i also was robbed of my precious time and energy because of the medias thumbs up reviews which should have been all thumbs downalthough the actors where good the chemistry was awkward and boringthe story line was a c poor it needed much more substance and qualityi will never trust movie reviews ever again how this got so many nominations blows mind this proves to me that hollywood is truly corrupt and filled with favoritism there are way too many movies better than this that did not get nominatedshame on you hollywood shame on you movie reviewers who lied about this being great i felt like i was stabbed in the back multiple times by watching this crap and the lies that are trying to keep this movie afloatdont give into to the hype this movie is just not right,happy
ive read 8 great reviews on this film i went and saw the movie last night and im usually a very positive person but was very disappointed the highly ranked reviews must be from sunshine pumpers who are desperate for a comeback of a 1940s musical or dont have a clue about a great musicalchicago west side story moulin rouge grease singing in the rain cabaret oklahoma king and i etc etc etc none of the songs were catchy or memorable the good emma stone did some very good acting also the sets were creative and colorful miscast ryan gosling he cant sing think of a 25 year old stoic kevin costner he would have been better type cast in a sports western buddy movie mystery gangster or in a drama most likely cast as eye candy for the 18 to 24 year old gals the opening scene is a hot sweaty la traffic jam on the freeway where 50 or more people jump out of their cars and start dancing and singing its a long nonstop shot that is very difficult to film think of orson welles touch of evil but we have all been there no fun brought back bad memories of heavy traffic jams and i just couldnt see the fun in a traffic jam its like i wouldnt want to see a song and dance scene of a er room or of anne frank no memorable classic lines show me the money youll shoot your eye out kid theres no crying in baseball folks this film will be forgotten in a year dont expect the next coming of the sound of music this is a poor mans woody allen movie,happy
telluride by the sea portsmouth nh led off its 2016 weekend film festival with a captivating film that hearkens back to the golden age of hollywood cinema yet remains firmly embedded in presentday los angeles life emma stone and ryan gosling bring a startling depth and nuanced feelings to what could easily have been another trite variation on the theme of falling in and out of love the film impressed me on so many levels for the quality of the direction and cinematography the seamless transition between musical songanddance numbers with a powerful narrative the inventive choreography the authenticity that stone and gosling brought to their portrayal of their characters and the amplification of the intensity of their romance enacted through their singing and dancing this film is nottobemissed by anyone who loves the classic ginger rodgersfred astaire movies and who longs for a modern re invention of this genre,happy
i struggled to keep awake during the movie  and that is not how a good film is supposed to be was not atrocious but im giving it 1 star because it was the first film ever that made me regret spending time and money on if it werent for all the hype i mightve given it 4was there a point in making this film there is nothing special is trying to convey the acting is bland the songs are dull the storyline is overused and predictable all in all it is a film of clichs i seriously cannot believe this won so many awards  should i be worried about the future of film or am i missing an important point,happy
and i wish i did the samethis was nothing a movie designed to please the academy awards committee in a self glorifying tribute to themselves a remembrance to the movies they used to make and watch in the good ol days by hollywood for hollywoodthere was no story i was waiting for the movie to start i wanted to leave so bad but i didnt want to ruin the experience for the other people i went to the cinema withturns out they were all doing the same thing and when we left the the cinema i heard people saying its the most boring piece of crap they had seen in a long while im not a buffoon honestly i like a good musical i grew up watching fred astaire movies with my grandma this was not that this movie is living on a hype dont buy in to it oh and if you kinda went ohehmwtf in the flying scene youre not alone,happy
emma stone has been noted from a number of strong performances she really does try to make the best out of a shallow one dimensional character but this is doomed to fall flat on its deflated face with the unbelievable unremarkable performance from ryan gosling theres visuals to take your breath away costume and set design that take you on a cinematic journey into hollywood apart from all of the gloss theres nothing left but a plain storyline with half developed characters that seems to be working aimlessly through a clich plot the on screen chemistry is what struck me as missing at first but then you realise this is largely due to a flat dynamic between characters how do they truly feel what do they truly love about one another why couldnt they work it out its not in there  we cant guess because we dont know them by the end theyre as much strangers as they are to us in the beginning much like a roller coaster that accelerates to the top only to slowly descend and safely pop us back to 0its overrated boring and sad because there was great potential for a cutting edge take on an old comforting theme instead we are on oooh then oh,happy
i went to this movie with reasonable but not overly high expectations and in the end it was a pleasant enough time but to suggest this is a great movie is astonishingit is a musical that looks back nostalgically to earlier great musicals but the leads cant sing cant dance can act a little pardon the reference  it seemed in keepingequally bad there are no songs of any worth in the whole moviethe lead actor is a jazz purist who is willing to put put his life in turmoil to live out his dream of playing real jazz instead everyone around him plays excellent jazz and he plays nothing but a very undernourished pop songon a positive note the opening scene was a gas superficial yes but really fun and impressive with its long tracking shot it gave me hope for the rest of the movie but that was the end of anything of any worththe complete split of opinion between this being a great movie and it being a very ordinary one is bizarre best picture really have people not been going to anything else this year there have been some absolutely wonderful movies this yeari do not understand at all perhaps it is because i love musicals and watch them a lot that i have something to compare it to i dont know but i have never been more confused,happy
the opening film of venice 73 a strong contestant of the golden lion tinseltowns latest prodigy damien chazelles wildlyanticipated followup of whiplash 2014 is an exuberant revamp of the golden ages musical formula and miraculously transposed onto a contemporary milieu an absolute stunner and expert raconteur chronicles the effervescent romance between a jazz pianist sebastian gosling and a waitress mia stone who aims to break into the showbiz in the city of angels without ever compromising its realistic spinfully embracing the widescreen splendor the films winning opening gambit is a slithering singing anddancing sequence on the chockablock freeway choreographed in one dashing long shot then the film pans out its narration of an evertypical girlmeetboy story in this case it is the girl who makes the first move divided by seasons with a wintertowinter rotation initially the story bifurcates in two different forks until the two finally hit the ground running interposed with scintillating music numbers which can hypnotically melt your heart and dazzle your mind chazelle adroitly centers on two protagonists through and through like in those vintage romantic flicks where you can see haloes around them anyone anything else in their world has all duly faded into the dark background whenever their eyes meet their hands touch and they kissgosling and stone whose onscreen dynamism has been patently tested in glenn ficarra and john requas crazy stupid love 2011 let sparks fly higher as they plunge wholeheartedly into the torrid journey from misunderstanding meetcute falling for each other to supporting each others dreams taking the middle ground or simply giving up doubting and bickering to the highest level of unconditional and unadulterated love  the holy sacrifice to let go of each other when their time is due the goslingstone pair is superbly amicable adorable and charismatic each is blessed with their own tuneful theme songs city of stars and audition respectively and satiates viewers with a showstopping tapdancing gosling as dapper as ever oozes with a heartthrobbing attentiveness and devotion as a talented pianist who is bent on opening his own jazz bar a traditionalist but deadly romantic stone portrays a character so naturally rooted in her chromosomes an aspiring actresstobe finally pays her dues after numberless humiliating auditions her vivacity comic timing and line delivery are topnotch both are eyeing for their second oscar nomination at this stageheading to the upcoming oscar race chazelle of course is the one who deserves all the fanfare for his virtuoso directing competence one will be sublimely intoxicated by his vision of la envelopped with an indelible mauve palette in lieu of its usual sundappled glamour vibrant props and tableaux vivants not to mention the central music elements which is always in the veins of chazelles works his cherrypicked jazzfusion the fluent and sleek choreography justin hurwitzs overwhelmingly soothing attendant score apart from several striking earworms all those abovementioned herald that a major cinematic director with a distinct and greatly entertaining aesthetics adorned by his music flair is in the offing in the land of lalast but definitely not the least how can one not praise for the silent epilogue in the end chazelle soberly let audience get a view of what would happen to the perfectmatched couple if they were living in an ideal hollywood fairytale but reality in most times is a far cry from fairytale we have to move on without our perfecthalf but that is not to say life will be miserable or intolerable thanks to chazelles perspicuous vision in a long run we might be able to cherish the true happiness once we were fortunately bequeathed and perhaps it never leaves us it always stay with us to savor to reminisce and to never give up our dreams,happy
i must be missing something here i went to see this expecting something fantastic given that it had 14 oscar nominations  including best actor and best actress i left feeling very disappointed and wondering what all the hype was abouta song and dance movie with stars that could neither sing nor dance how does that work the answer is very plain  it doesnt the best dancing in the film was the one where the dancers were in silhouette there was a nice flowing movement to it and the two dancers moved gracefully this was meant to be the two leads dancing but i suspect that this dance was performed by proper dancers  it was so different is class from the dances where gosling and stone were visiblewith competent performers it might not have been half as bad  but i still dont think it would warrant all the accolades it has been given the story was a bit predictable and the whole film about 20 minutes too long,happy
i do not like musicals but there was so much talk about this film that i saw it and i must say that i repent deeply its one of the worst movies ive seen lately the stereotype of the musician who lives almost defeated and scratching the poverty is a sin in which the director had not fallen in the masterpiece whiplash besides it shows the woman as a completely unstable and shameless human being who without showing us a background of his relationship with greg falls into the infidelity easier a fly in a dump and to finish off she lives so unhappily that years after being married she can do nothing more than imagine what her life would be like with her old adventure pathetic it shows some more forms of human misery than the possibility of seeing something pleasant something endearing that makes you see it again some mentions about jazz that do not transcend at all actually i will forget this movie,happy
there is absolutely nothing special about this at all but the sheer number of so called critics raving about how wonderful it is will have you questioning what crazy tickboxes they have that make a good movie in their eyes or maybe how much they were paid to say it was good its almost as if they dont watch the same movie as the rest of us i dont get it they make a movie like they used to 50 years ago and the world creams their pants why not just watch an actual 50 year old movie most of them are better than this anyway i havent felt so strongly about such an absurdly crap waste of time since that dribble slumdog millionaire won every award going just like that film i watched this questioning how society could possibly think it was oscar material while pondering how some of these insane critics got their jobs in the first place facepalm,happy
it seems not too many know the french director jacques demys films especially his musicals like the young girls of rochefort or the umbrellas of cherbourg or donkey skin  nor michel legrand who scored these as well as many other films those were made in the late 60ies and 70ies they are available on netflix  highly recommendedobviously the director of watched them over and over again but he failed totally in recreating them and transporting them into our times i find the music of with the exception of its main song rather forgettable the same with most of the choreography the lead actors are ok but i dont see any depth the story line is rather thin very cookie cutter and weighed down by too much sentimentality,happy
dear damien i really had great expectations for this film i waited for a year to see this film i was so excited that i walked ten minutes in the rain to go see this film i am going to tell you what i felt about the film as i watched your film so that you can learn something from my letteri was very happy to see the initial traffic jam and the first song i was thrilled to see what happens next as soon as the film started i started to feel there was no story line to keep me interested there were no plot points who wrote this script i could not relate to emma stones character because there was nothing to look forward to regarding her goal she was just an aspiring actress who was lost in los angeles failing auditions whats interesting about that the film was disjointed it was a big mess the biggest mistake you made was to cast ryan gosling this actors face is bland he is probably angry with someone on the set and it shows on his face this guy has no expressions on his face he has no idea how to act in certain scenes he just keeps his face expressionless so that nobody can relate to him in the film deborah aquila should have helped you find a better actor who selected ryans wardrobe there was nothing interesting about his bland clothes to go with the musical his emotions on his face do not match the flow of the story ryan you are not a face for musical or romance or hero for a romantic comedy you are a face of a villain or a boxing film you should do those films the way the director have these two characters meet is so weak there was nothing romantic about how they meet emma stone is a good actress but she kept emotionallystaring in space in lot of scenes which were not removed in editing and it affected her performance acting with ryan gosling also affected her performance there was one scene in the film where she goes and stands right in front of movie theater full of audience and nobody reacts or shouts as she stands in front of all of this audience while movie is playing how unbelievable i wanted to like something something in this film i tried very hard i wanted to like a scene where they are about to hold hands in movie theater but even damien ruined that romantic scene by doing something stupid i wont forgive you for that then someone gave you a museum to shoot in you should have made best use of those scenes but you did not there was nothing exciting about it there were sound problems with car horns it was so loud that i had to put fingers in my ears out of the blue an african american guy john legend gives ryan a deal and music contract there was no development for that plot point damien you need to really work hard on screen writing skills i wonder who gave you money to make this film for such a weak screenplay at one point the african american guy says to ryan you are pain in the as ryan honestly you are pain in the  i so badly wanted to like this film and wanted some scene to touch me but when that moment came where emma is called back for an audition i thought she will tell her own story which was so powerful she tells some aunts story which made no sense to the story line what a disaster emma says at the endit hurts a little bit you know what i am hurt i need damien chazelle and ryan gosling to send me apology letter for making such a bad film which i had to go and see  i was in tears when i left the theater i am sure you will read this and you know where to write me my imdb email address best regards z,happy
to boot i loved almost all the separate components of the film individually but i didnt love the resulting bundleaesthetically my eyes were gently caressed with beauty for the full duration of the movie and for that im most appreciativeryan gosling is his usual immaculate self succeeding in gracing us with yet another stunning performance  stylish suave and utterly charmingemma stone has her ups and middles but never a down and she gave me one of the sole two scenes that made my breathing falter against an emotional hiccup another winnow on the musical side of thingsmehthe songs left me disinterested the overall sound dress of the film rang uninspired and repetitive only resonating with my pathos during a couple of instances while the rest lagged tiredly to the request of the more instinctdriven scenesthe story itself a bit silly no simplistic almost benefiting from a strong start a fantastic ending and the sparking chemistry between the protagonists on the other hand lacking any sort of actual substance past the forced demand to fall head over heels with the kitty cuteness that we are being presented no questions asked i dont like having my arm twisted into feeling and this is where this otherwise whimsical tale of sensory affluence hit another miss for meto sum up i acknowledge the individuality of the project felt the strive and artistry that is so craftily weaved into the seams of this audiovisual extravaganza and i was without a doubt entertained on the flip side the way it all translated to my reason the shortcomings of make this a middletier effort only edging ahead on account of the fact that along with the glossy couple i got to glide with effortless elegance through a starry night brush shoulders with monet journey into the colourful and the capriciousfor that fact i will accept defeat bump it up another star and humbly take off my fedora to it,happy
i just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie i expected the best but only got some songs and the worst ending ever i liked the cast but the movie just wasnt good enough for me personally i like happy endings this was nothing like iti dont recommend,happy
i saw this movie on the airplane and it was so boring it wasnt the dancing that was boring or the singing but the script the movie just dragged on with no real story to follow the dancing was ok the singing was ok but the story was not there i finally ended up changing movies because after a hour or more it should have plot or some sort of goal it was just a sorry guy with no motive and girl who been hurt and gets more hurt and after that i lost interest too bad it seemed like a promising movie but the script was just a very sorry story and boring,happy
what are they thinking how is it possible that this crap movie got 14    oscar nominations  did they really see it it is bad from the beginning to the end saccharinestyle and no substance you see better musical numbers in commercials the opening number was cringe worthy and then it got even worse the singing and dancing is absolutely awful the storytelling is so poor and predictable it is an insult to the intelligence of every three year old and even worse the movie is so terribly terribly boring  i should have been warned although because the overhyped movie whiplash of the same director bored me almost to death before  the only reason i did not leave the cinema was the beautiful and charming emma stone even she could not rescue this wreck of a movie in the end it was a bitter disappointment is this the best what we can expect from hollywood  it is the perfect film for the trump era thumb hollow and a big nothing lets hope this era is short,happy
this has to be the most overrated movie of all time and it nowhere near deserves this attention and surely none of the hyped awards is a cute story mediocre movie and has some nice dance and music scenes but that is about it the singing of emma stone and ryan gossling is absolutely a joke and falls flat entirely it does not reach the quality of moulin rouge or other film musicals like dream girls well maybe it isnt even a musical at all and they happen to just sing a bit i can not understand the hype and accolades this movie getsmost overrated and boring movie of all time,happy
is an american romantic musical comedydrama film written and directed by damien chazelle in 2016 after its success at the 74th golden globe awards i couldnt give a go by the musical that set a record and won seven awards including best motion picture musical or comedy best director best actor best actress best screenplay best original score and best original song what can i say after finally watching this film well best wishes to the new hollywood era your golden age has gonethe idea of recreating and breathing a new life in outstanding musicals of golden age if hollywood turned out a complete fiasco is full of weird clichs awful mise en scne poorly rehearsed dancing actions and doubtful twists in the plot furthermore the production department failed to make outstanding shots as well as edit them in a right way with a good taste i wont even start to complain about bad color correction and sound seriously for the budget in thirty million dollars they couldnt produce clear recording that is supposed to be a number one factor in musical bad for themthe first scene on the highway gave me full understanding that this musical is just a frustration the dancers probably failed to join one of the step up movies and were redirected to as a joke choreography is terrible when the viewer cant see it as a whole action or focus on main characters choreography in is more than terrible i was laughing not in a good way and again it is one of the main parts of such genre as musical the plot itself is boring and slow there is no progression and no drive that brings the will to continue watching it half of actions and scenes were added and shown with no particular reasons to show them actually there is no evident chemistry between the two protagonists what is kind of shameful especially because of the fact that it is not the first project where ryan gosling and emma stone play together come on guys show some love for each other some drama at least their relationship on stage was more comedic than tremulousacting one of the strangest things for me is to watch the golden globes best actress in a movie where she can barely act on the one hand she was supposed to be a failed actress who went her journey and reached her goals but on the other hand emma stone havent done a good job in the general scenes also regarding ryan gosling his passion for jazz was overacted as he has no passion at all besides as a musician myself it was a pain watching his performances it was so obvious that he just cant play piano i almost closed my eyes so i can only lose myself in music as well as in their dancing scenes it looked too lame to sup up is a pure frustration mixed with some dramatic comedy i cant call it a musical with a capital m actually i cant call it a musical at all no good music no good sound no good dancing,happy
the story is as thin as it is simpleminded and totally banal the movie would likely be a total flop without the two main actors  and without the giant hype and marketing campaign that has obviously been unleashed the soundtrack is largely uninspiring the dancing and singing of emma stone and ryan gosling is ok but far from exceptional or groundbraking i have no idea how anyone could spot magic or authenticity in this highly superficial totally overrated movie the only really authentic about this overhyped piece is that it is a true reflection of todays hollywood selfabsorbed totally superficial full of hypocrisy and unable to even consider any other view than that of their own echo chamber there are obviously and luckily some notable exceptions to this among the myriad hollywood stars and starlets but they are far and few between it says a lot about the golden globes that they have been awarded in bulk to this movie maybe the competition was even worse if this film gets oscars as many predict it will simply be fitting after all a hollywood in their castles and mansions being totally detached from reality from the life of ordinary people in this world from ground realities they will likely love what they see here even though it is just praising and celebrating its own echo chamber this movie is hollywoodnarcissism at its worst oh and btw these are the same people who mock trump for his narcissism go figure,happy
i am usually mistrustful of overhyped movies but on this occasion i was in the mood for a feel good musical with an upbeat message  not something i am usually drawn to the sunday times reviewer said that hating is like hating a puppy and gave it 4 stars well i like puppies very much but this movie was a massive disappointment bad singing bad dancing and a mediocre script made this movie in my opinion one of the worst movies of the last 12 months how this can be considered as oscar material is beyond me but then clearly i am in a minority  although judging by many of the reviews on here  not that small a minority the second half in my opinion was better than the first half and yes i did get most of the symbolism and the attempts at pastiche and various homages to the past this definitely wont be on my best of list,happy
i love musicals but i must have missed the stand in the theater where they were handing our the coolaid for this one sorry but i grew up musicals entertaining life and work but this is corns none of the stars are the expected style or quality the story is grotesquely poor and without logic gosling is pathetic i was left with the desire of someone who closes the keyboard cover in their hands the voice of the stones allow you to pray for a good dose of pharyngitis in short singing or even dancing the promotional machine hollywood continues to tell us how great it is and people believe it in short i lost 2 hours 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life for our summer trips to australia it is almost as bad as the passengersi think it must be an exercise in navelgazing as the awards bodies see themselves in these two characters havent they all struggled to get auditions havent they all had screen tests havent they all tried to make it in hollywood of course they have the awards givers like looking at themselves in the mirror personally i do not like what they see dont bother wasting your energy or you will quit halfway through as i did 0 out of 10,happy
i cant understand why people love this movie i literally fell asleep in it at least 5 times my girlfriend kept waking me up it only got more boring the longer the movie ran movies are getting worse as the years go by if this wins best picture then i may be done going to the movies,happy
ill never get those two hours back or my money i should have read further into the reviews on here before wasting my time this is nothing like i expected i truly dont understand all the hype this movie has received and how its winning so many awards the acting  dancing is not very good and their singing leaves a lot to be desired ive seen better singing  dancing on the muppet show i thought there would be lots of visuals of la but no pretty much studio lot and apartment scenes i was so disappointedplease dont waste your time on this movie just go out to eat and spend your money on a good meal,happy
nothing good but the cinematography the story is so dull i dont know how this has a high rating after the way too long opening song i was bored already it did not get better i would not waste your time unless you love musicals so much that the lack of engaging plot or characters will not bother you or you just want to see if for the cinematography that was great i like both of these actors but i dont see how they got awards for these roles just because they danced and sang this was definitely hyped by the right people but there is not much thereryans piano playing was splendid tho,happy
what an awful movie are the rating a joke the movie cinematography was so tight and out of balance that it was disturbing talking heads that themselves get cropped off from time to time people bumping into the edge of the screen or looking off the screen it was out of balance and dizzying as they panned between the charactersthen the story is supposed to be about love but ends up being about narcissism achieving maximum career success is better than true love in the real world love is about compromise and working towards mutual success of course this movie is about los angeles and hollywood so maybe that is the way it works there looking at the divorce rate for celebrities but this is not the reality that exist in the other 99 of the country so i do not get the appeal of this moviei did bump the rating to 2 because there is a good scene with john legend singing in a night club,happy
this is a film for those who like predictable and corny song and dance romance plots i saw the high rating and since i love emma stone and ryan gosling i had high hopes for this flick but    alas   i couldnt even stomach it after the first 15 or so minutes and gave up im surprised i lasted that long what a crashing borewest side story or oklahoma this aint i live in ca and resent the fact that this film tries to transport its inferior east coast letsdanceourwaydownbroadway type schlock to our sandy shoresi honestly got the feeling that while emma was enjoying her stint as a singing dancing out of work actress ryan was a complete fish out of water bless him for tryingi guessthere must have been a lot of theater goers who loved this film it just goes to show that de gustibus non est disputandum there is no accounting for taste,happy
positively one of the worst movies never mind musicals that i have ever watched in my entire life and i am now almost 64i am not only amazed at the mediocrity of the movie but also by the response from those movie goers who see fit to rate this production as 10 starone reviewer suggested that it was the best movie they had seen since star wars when they were a kid what planet is this reviewer now living on heshe could not possibly have seen the same movie that i endured just a few hours ago it lacked storyline pace memorable songs it had one simplistic tune melody or whatever which was constantly repetitive the characters lacked depth and credibility and the actors were poor in the art of song and dance the backdrops and sfx were abominable and b movie like in executionif this movie succeeds at the oscars it is further proof of how out of touch america is with the rest of the world in both politics and the arts the only saving grace is that neither can get much worse and that in the spirit of hope great things will arise from the ashes,happy
it is flashy and colorful and the acting is good  the dancing and singing not so much some of the music is really well placed if forgettable but it is a movie that pretends for 128 minutes to be something it is not it is not a musical it tries to be but it forgets 20 minutes in and then remembers in the end for one wonderful classical musical scene that would be brilliant if it was all that was but the rest is not really a musical mostly because while it doesnt lack music it lacks music numbers and the ones it has feel mostly out of place and there only so a bland love story can be called something more interesting it is a movie with music not particularly good music either there are two numbers that stuck with me for longer then the length of the movie the rest might work within the story but doesnt manage to stand on its ownthe movie also pretends to be original which it is not there has been stories like that and better ones the characters are not sympathetic either he is snobbish and selfcentered and even in his growth remains a jerk she has no idea what she wants and while she pretends to grow she remains a child if the actors were any less charming and worked less well together i would be rooting for them to get slapped for half the movie it made caring if they stay together or not and watching their struggles and their happy moments much less involved and uninvolved audience is not something you are striving for as a story teller and the ending of the movie dont even let me start on that i was somewhat looking forward to it despite the movies flaws and then the movie slapped me in the face and spit on itself and me as well i ended up feeling lied to and took for a fool i have seen two wonderful movies that same week and going out of it was everything a movie should not make you feel disappointed mislead empty just like the movie is,happy
the fact that this movie is rated 89 out of 10 and chicago is 72 and moulin rouge is 76 is literally beyond me although i like emma stone and ryan gosling as actors they really should not be casted for musicals neither of them can dance or sing properly no matter how much they tried and i bet they did i wonder if anyone here giving this movie a 8 or a 9 has watched chicago or moulin rouge both had incredible cinematography plots and had lead actors who could singdance the hell out of their movies and now here come ryan and emma who are mediocre at best at this musical im kind of disappointing at their casting as lead roles because i think that with different lead actors two who can actually sing and dance this movie wouldve been breathtaking on another note it was a charming film with beautiful cinematography and a pleasant vibe i did not mind the blurs as someone mentioned or thought there were plot holes i would recommend it to other but only to realise that emma and ryan shouldve not been cast,happy
i wasnt expecting much from this movie but to my surprise it was even worst than i wouldve imaginedi mean musicals arent really my type of movie but still and dont even get me started on the acting i mean lets just say that if emma stone wins an oscar i will not longer respect the academy ive seen better acting in tv commercials it was so bad that i felt that i was watching an actor playing a character playing another character and not in a well down way also the way that the story was told it was really hard to connect with the characters and the somewhat romantic story of the movie i think that the story had potential and it couldve been a great movie it was just bad casting and too much musical they shouldve toned down a little,happy
this is the slowest dullest musical i have ever sat through why it gets so much hype beats me unless the reviews and nominations have been paid for by the producers the whole production completely lacks sparkle the plot is not particularly good while the music and choreograph are largely uninspiring i only sat through the whole thing so as not to disturb my fellow moviegoers when leaving the cinema the comments from people around us were of disappointment and disbelief that such a poor film could be rated so highly in the press and other media if i had been at home watching a dvd copy i would probably have given up after the first 30 minutes,happy
is the rating too high on this site for this movie or whatall the hype and nominations for this horrible movie reminds me of how 98 of the media reports from a liberal point of view instead of from a nonpartisan point of view disgustingthis movie lacks everything from acting to so called singing horrible is what should be the headlines for this atrocitywe had to force ourselves to watch this till the end several times we were on the verge of shutting it off this proves that the oscars should be abolished and who really cares if an iranian actress doesnt go to the oscars and how long have you lived in a free countrynever lolpoor ryan gosling i always liked himdisappointing that he chose such a flop to act in thought he didnt want to do the hollywood thing anymore proves hollywood money can buy anything or anyone,happy
not written a review for a while but this overrated bore fest prompted me to warn others honestly i havent been so bored in a long time its way too long hardly any dialogue and hardly any singing to push the story forward the story really isnt interesting either and the relationship that develops in it is just isnt believable a couple of conversations and a dance together and suddenly they are a couple and we are supposed to care i havent paid to watch a film in a long time but took the wife because she heard it was amazing but even she screwed her nose up at the end and she loves musicals pearce brosnan singing in mama mia was more entertaining than this entire film,happy
jk simmons acting as an arrogant dork in whiplash was bad enough but now we have this dreadful piece of schlock that never should have happened with jk simmons acting as an arrogant dork again the only thing this movie did was make me want to watch some of the stunning musicals of the past halfcentury which are light years ahead of this i suppose everyone will sit around with sentimental grins on their faces thinking how nice that someone remembers hollywood enough to shoehorn a bunch of current celebrities into a script that makes you wish someone would fall off a freeway overpass when did escapism start to resemble nails dragging across a blackboard,happy
a short note from a genuine reviewer  do not waste your time even planning to watch this one one of the most terrible few movies i ever saw and the most overrated movie ever this is neither a musical nor a feature film seriously lacking a credible plot or great acting ryan and emma are just stonefaced monuments but moving my time at the theater did not last for more than 30 minutes and i just followed the exodus en mass and i am warning you guys  do not get conned by the critics and those who give 1010 here it should go down history as a worst movie made ever all this hype is only because it is made about hollywood i am so shocked and aghast that this crap made 11 nominations for gglobe and won 7 but not a single for light between the oceans  one of the best movies in 2016 this craziness is all created and driven by the corrupt hollywood prop machinery to boost themselves and their favourites heres the mantra  as long as you make a movie on hollywood dreams its gonna rake all the awards however rotten it iswhy this movie gets such roaring ovations and kudos is just because this world is full of so many naked emperors,happy
words fail me i can only assume that the lovers of this film have little past experience watching quality musicals romances or comedies who the hell thought this mess up what were they sniffingthe scene where the two stars suddenly fly into the stratosphere in a movie theater was laughable silly and ridiculous our movie night with friends turned into groans and unintended laughter at its stupidity to add insult to injury the split second cuts from scene to scene added an amateurish touch to the whole affair after an hour we couldnt take anymore and shut it off in disgust if you want misery get a root canal instead it would be much easier to endureits sad that a whole generation of movie goers will accept this garbage as a good movie obviously theyve never seen very many good moviesbut look on the bright side seventh grade girls will really love this crock,happy
makes me upset because i feel like there is a great movie in this film it starts off great with a big sweeping musical number thats a lot of fun as it progresses the movie slowly falls apart the pace breaks down more songs become arbitrary the first song is arbitrary too but ill let it go because its just the opening number and there are many threads that dont go anywhere and lack any meaningful moments the couple getting married they showed up three or four times we dont care about them they have no character they are simply there to make sebastian who we also dont care about sadthe john legend scenes although they progress the story are awkwardly paced and weird oh sebastian uses an electric keyboard now whoa amazing it came across as awkwardly placed as the song scene in birdemicwhat im about to say is not criticism but thoughts on the characters mia is a terrible character sebastian is also despicable at points the character i related to most is the writer character at the party and he is trivial at best in the filmtherefore the criticism is that there are no characters that one can get involved with and relate to in this mess of a filmother than the lacking characters clumsy plots lack of good music besides 23 songs awkward conversations that lead to nothing meaningful the movie is well done damien chazelle is a good director and has an eye for filmessentially people worship everything and value nothing and that is no truer than this film people worship the superficial of this movie ryan gosling and emma stone the beautiful shots the colors the sad music they play fifty million timesand the fact its different critics love things that are different because they watch 100s of movies thus is different and they freak out dont believe the hypethe movie is way too long it could have cut out multiple scenes and wouldnt be missing anything  that is the definition of terrible pacingi wanted to love this movie i wanted to feel everything at this movie i was told it was the best movie ever and will make you sob at the endall i have to say is all these 10 star reviewers are in i walked out of the theater and said really overall this film is a solid 67,happy
my goodness what a disappointment good actors good director and rewards all over the place also i really enjoy the musical genre so i thought nothing could go wrongbut this film is so long boring and selfindulgent no songs or dancing scenes will make a fond memory and you wont be humming any song on your way outall the jazz bits are pretentious i felt no passion of sharing like i had felt in whiplash here you just have to accept that jazz is this big and sacred thing frankly that the worst thing you can say about anything and get that idea hammered through your head throughout the whole moviethe story is bland with lazy writing taking over and being the main starthis movie just got me bored and happy to see the end sign first time i felt that way after a musical film usually you come out of those with enough energy to get you through a couple of days,happy
the story is inconclusive narration is broken we have start of the plot just a piece of culmination and then final what happened between am i myself must invent the motives of the two heroes this gap in narration also makes the kaleidoscope of what if senseless tapdance is muted by music  nonsense this dance is supposed to be heard main hero walks in the same shoes for tapdance till the end what for he will never tap again this movie reminds me of cafe society but simpler and with dancing the music is good but whiplash had good music too and it was also stronger in many ways though i liked the scene in observatory and what the hero of ryan gosling told mia about jazz so this movie is nice to watch only once i will certainly rewatch hello dolly or west side story but never again,happy
lala land is a very important film it received so many oscars but we have seen weak films awarded before that it is important as a proclamation of incompetence this film invaded the musical genre which traditionally belonged to artists who can sing and dancethe film is about a young woman who wants to become an actor and a young musician ryan gosling who plays main protagonist is a good actor but this role is not for him he is extremely clumsy and when he dances around a streetlight it resembles a parody on gene kelly in singing in the rain his voice reminds one of a whining mosquito concerning emma stone she also cannot sing or dance at least she is not as clumsy as ryanthe films choreography was made with the imagination of a kindergarten teacher the plot is a collection of trivialities and the camera work is made by a person who does not known anything about composition except for the central position in the frame which makes this banal film even more boring and trivial than it could be only positive aspect is the light feeling of nostalgia is left by the filmread more at httpindiecinemacom201702lalalandreview,happy
nice to look at pleasant but nothing special yes they had to learn some dance numbers and to play the piano but that does not all of a sudden mean this is some incredible movie it was just fine not bad not memorable i sat down with an open mind ready for a new cinematic experience and left without any reason to recommend it to anyone i had heard of the incredible acting from ryan gosling and emma stone but found no real moments that made me buy in to the relationship they had not once was an emotion drawn out of me for the entire movie even as charming as the actors in this movie have the ability to be so by all means watch this movie but you will find it a challenge to remember it after a week,happy
my wife and i found this movie dull we even dozed off a little it appeared to me to be strictly a vanity vehicle for the two stars their undeniable good looks and their mediocre dancing the plot was superficial with a pedestrian ending before the ending the story line dragged on without much excitement or even interesting twists it stretched an ofttold story of romance into a boring featurelength filmthis movies award performance says more to me about the hollywood awards themselves than about the movie the hollywood community praising itself and its favored members vanity of vanities all is vanity ecclesiastes i2,happy
musicals have always been of my favorite movies i owned the albums yes vinyls of west side story the sound of music music man and more les misrables is my favorite movie of all time so when the critics went crazy for this movie calling it the academy award movie of the year and nominated for the golden globe award i was excited i did notice that only two theaters chose to show it the week i saw it meaning the theaters werent very impressed with its appeal the theater owners were right this is the most disappointing movie ive seen this year  sebastian ryan gosling  mia emma stone0 are the story and they are ok as always i liked jk simmons in his very small role and i liked john legend in his small role thats it i didnt care for the music the story or how it was told an hour and a half into the movie i thought that even a great ending wasnt going to save this movie i didnt need to worry the ending was the worst part of the movie the critics are going onandon about the 31year old writer and director of this movie it looked like it was written and directed by an adolescent to me,happy
we left in the middle i personally hate musicals it look stupid for me to see people singing to each other  why not talking  pure stupidity cant understand the high rating for that silly film i hear it is nominated for some oscars  how come  evan for musical lovers there is nothing special in that movie,happy
i have never seen such a horrible film since 2012 it had terrible acting terrible music and an incredibly mindnumbing plot emma stone is without a doubt the most annoying actress i have ever encountered she is so horrible that i will make sure she is not an actress in any film i watch again i wouldnt even see her films on a bet i would go if paid to do so but only with earplugs and an eyemaskthe plot is a typical boymeetsgirloverandoveragain til they become a thing which is fine if its pulled off well this wasnt for the reasons i named abovei cant believe this movie got good reviews at all i had to walk out after 3040 minutes i waited until my very tiny thankfully bag of popcorn and beer were finished which i downed as quickly as possible so i could get the heck out of there and then i got out of there like a bat out of hedoubletoothpicksyou might want to watch it if you dont consider emma stone the worst and most annoying actress ever andor watch ryan gosling desperately try to keep up with her poor acting he had some trouble but he managed to be a bad actor as wellanyway good riddance to bad rubbish im glad i got outta there and that i didnt go with a person who wanted to stayfind a film that isnt annoying and go for it well thats my recommendation anyway,happy
ryan gosling and emma stone prance about the stage for two mindnumbing hours presumably searching for some plot and characterisation i cant even recall what the characters were called but they may as well have just been ryan and emma for that is all they were it was an utterly tedious unengaging experience and devoid of any quality or substance i gave up after an hour against my better judgement i watched the rest the next day however i may as well have been watching shark attack 7 or some nonsense like that for i just could not be bothered even looking at the tv the singing and dancing did little for me with two leads not very adept at either i derived absolutely nothing from this entirely vacuous experience i really do not understand what the point of this was110,happy
this is typical hollywood marketing machine at work the music is horrible acting is just average and seriously how in the world did this movie ever get madehow in the world did this movie get such high ratings from critics oh yeah probably because of all the fancy dinners or payoffs they received to love this film seriously this movie is just horrible horrible horribledont waste your  on this pile of garbagecan i please get my 2 hours life back if not at least a coupon would be nice for chic fil a,happy
most boring movie ever as is normal with movies today the worst most sleep inducing movies seem to get the best reviews from professional criticsi have to say that the requirements of ten lines for a movie review is ridiculous if you dont like a movie why does one need to write so much liking a movie makes it easy to write a long review hating a movie doesnt take long at allknowing hollywood this movie will probably be nominated for a million awards even though it doesnt deserve anything what it deserves is to be forgotten completely,happy
whether the wrongprize scandal in oscar is a message to trump by deep state or just plain dumbness this movie does not deserve any oscars far from it i cannot believe marketing is so powerful in todays movie industry it just turns a bad movie without any script any character development or quality even musical quality into a oscar winning hype i watched this movie with my girlfriend and we counted the minutes waiting for a quick end to this torture at one point we wondered if there is love in this movie what is it that we feel for each other  or if we are in love than what the heck are they telling in this movieif i say that the only good piece of music in the movie is i ran a flock of seagulls you can guess the rest,happy
i so looked forward to this film and was greatly disappointed i find it hard to believe that it is being spoken of as an oscar contender ryan gosling was fairly good in his movements but rather weak in singing emma stone is awful i do not comprehend her popularity at all she never seems genuine to me i feel i can tell shes acting and cannot get into her character some of the dancing scenes were downright silly and the songs unrealistic thereby giving a feeling of falsehood the main premise was believable but depicted poorly the cinematography was fine as were the period artifacts displayed lending authenticity to the era however overall it was simply a letdown and i cannot recommend it to anyone at all,happy
i dont get it some movies get really really lucky and fortunate to get the high and rave reviews and also oscars im a musician and i couldnt stand this movie  its only noise at the best  not much music in itthis movie is overhyped by their marketing department to make more money stay away from this unless you want to waste a couple of your hours that you will never get back,happy
yes they are very cute the story is very romantic some songs not all of them are remarkable the editing is really clever the production design and photography are pure eye candy and its a cool film no doubt maybe im getting old but this is an average movie at best and theres nothing new in itgene kelly did this 60 years ago better with far less technology as for the story it cant be less originalgirl meets boy they follow their dreams together etc etc etc i give it a 7 being generous i liked it as an entertaining little film but its not a classic by any stretch of the imagination in a few months when the hype has passed nobody will talk about it i give a 10 to the marketing campaign though they managed to shovel it down everyones throat,happy
much like arrival which the critics went gaga over and was a drama disguised as a science fiction film the critics went gaga over this as well perhaps if theyd had some musically inclined people in it rather than the cast they did it might have kept my attention but it didnt i find ryan gosling bland and really while i like emma she needs to stretch her acting muscles the big eyed earnest waif act is wearing a bit thin her character in this could have been her character from easy a theres that little of a difference some critics have compared this to singin in the rain but there is no comparison thats a classic and this is just another overhyped hollywood movie im sure some people love it but im pretty sure just as many didnt,happy
2016 written and directed by damien chazelle and thats the problem a textbook example of the folly of letting a writer direct his own script ive rarely seen such a pretentious muddled incoherent mess the basic problem is that chazelle doesnt know whether hes written a romantic drama or a musical romance an independent director would have cut and rewritten the script to be firmly one or the other either way it would have been a good movie as it is two fine actors are wasted as are some fine musicians and dancers worst of all the movie was boring only plus some well done jazz,happy
what an overrated film the opening sequence on the la freeway was nearly unbearable with its artificial politically correct nonsensical this is la vibe id say the only fun thing to watch in this film was ryan gosling he really does justice to wellfitting clothes he must have a perfect body emma stone was fishlike to me her bulbous eyes like a flounder in the beautiful briny deep the director deserves credit for trying to make romance happen in the digital age but in general its too late everyone in privileged america is pretty much a soulless zombie drone driving a prius and numbly staring into the glow of their iphone in a fantasy world where people dance and sing only gene kelly stanley donen and jacques demy could do that possibility justice dont believe the hype this movie is flat dull wishful thinking for a bygone era it will sweep awards no doubt because in a soulless 21st century this film is the closest anything released by a mainstream film industry will have resembling heart a flounder dead on arrival wrapped in pretty yellow paper in my humble opinion two stars for ryans wellfitting pants and tight shirts,happy
first it is interesting it has great visual but the story is unclear it is not focusing on certain topic is it about romance or about pursuing their dream at first it is interesting when we were exposed to the difficulties the character facing to achieve their dream but what is actually the conflict is after half of movie it is not even clear after i skip it i realize half of the movie spend focusing on seb seriously i thought it is far more interesting if the movie just focus on mia since we are exposed a lot to her complications frozen main character is unclear as elsa is much interesting but it is about anna however the story is still connected and the conflict is clear and it disappoint me more when suddenly mia said no one come to her theater why there is no scene about it yep the visual might be interesting but the plot is failure it deserved the oscar mix up,happy
i dont usually bother to write reviews but i just couldnt stand by passively on this one this film simply does in no way shape or form deserve above 6 and thats why im giving it a 1 now it is at 84 currently in a word lll is mediocre the dancing and singing are poor the plot is clichd yet contrived the characters are charmless and lack chemistry the music is ok but not great at all the acting is alright but just that i could go on the only plusses are on the technical and production sides i thought it missed a great opportunity to tell a more important original and uplifting story about when you dont make it even if youre good it decided not to do so in a really forced and lazy way i dont even know if this is a musical a nicholas sparks type film or a feel good comedy it tries to be all and is mediocre to bad at all as well as in the overall end result the movie says nothing worth saying is a bit depressing and very boring which is no small feat considering its supposed to be a musical well heres the thing hollywood to make a great musical you need a good or fun story with great actors who are great singers and dancers you also need at least five great compositions and choreographies oh i see you dont because people are increasingly sheeple and stupid all you really need is a great marketing machine come on people wake up,happy
i see the universal adulation this film has had and theres much to admire to my ears though its sadly lacking in the one key element every musical needs great songs with the possible exception of audition the fools who dream theres not a memorable tune or soaring line to be found it doesnt help that neither of the two leads has a strong singing voice and as for dancing  the steps are limited and even within that scope not particularly wellexecuted dancing in a musical has to be overthetop good to carry the energy of the filmbut the worst thing really is the lack of structure musicals are selective in the parts of the story that they take to build the threeact structure the characters have to be established before we can care about them have to face an obstacle so that we care more and have to overcome it or die trying at which point the big numbers come out here we start with a big number  the dance on the la freeway  but theres no reason for dancing as of yet the love notatfirstsight motif is a good old one but here its so choppily presented that were not sure whether we should care or not it could be a slowmotion screwball comedy or a musical revue punctuated by little lifedramas  but to be a musical it must soar this one is leaden forced and was painful for me to watch despite much admirable production work and cinematography after i got home i watched singin in the rain as an antidote and felt much better its not impossible to revive the moribund musical genre  it was done in 1981 with pennies from heaven and several times over by baz luhrmann who even managed to make some of his non professional singing stars sound pretty darn good see moulin rouge but despite all the hype this film to me felt like seeing an old friend imperfectly resurrected from the grave with none of the old lively exuberance for which  once upon a time  he was known the world over,happy
if you see the first scene you have seen the hole movie it is a love story that have no beginning it starts without any script it is a nonsense o story without reasons and plot it is just a accumulation of songs and scenes and for most they are not very impressive the result a very very boring picture after the first hour i realize that it will be a real challenge to finish the film i was so so so boring it is impossible to spoiler this film cause have no plot at all so if you are smart listen to the music at spotify it is the only thing that it is worth to be heard or watched of this movie,happy
this movie is so overrated it has great production value but it kind of ends there the movie is a musical but half way through it decides to suddenly stop being a music and just turns into a boring drama with a dull plot although the movie started with decent momentum it quickly just falls apart and gets really boring in the second half of the moviemusicals often dont have very strong plots but makeup for it with music did not do this instead they just have a few songs and a boring plot also emma stone and ryan gosling were terrible choices for this movie they both are mediocre singers especially gosling and terrible dancers the dancing scene seemed so forced and unnatural there are literally thousands of amazing theater actors and singers out there but for some reason they chose two people who have zero experience in show theater makes no sensecritics need to stop judging movies based on production value this movie was mediocre at best and doesnt deserve any special recognition,happy
in the movies defense i couldnt make it past 24 minutes i ignored the feedback from friends trusted the ratings like the cast and thought maybe they just didnt get it holy you know what  the time period is off no chemistry jazz vs christmas carolsugh i just hope it all worked out in the end and they got together and everybody loved fake jazz at the end what rhymes with trite that asidei have an idea where a handsome blues man is trying to make it chicago at the beginning of blues you know the 1980s and he meets a struggling beautiful girl but they dont get along at first but she likes his crazy new sound,happy
can not understand how someone who is not a 6 year old can find this movie interesting a waste of time and money for any adult male or female all people i spoke to were very disappointed poor story poor execution acting was ok dancing was ok but this is the 21st century hollywood can do better much better this may have been considered a good movie 3050 years ago not today not even 1 element in the movie that is new that brings to life a new point of view that hasnt been treated before in a better manner in so many movies nothing that makes you wonder or dream i am trying to think of a good word regarding the movie maybe the acting which was ok thats it,happy
my wife and i were really looking forward to watching this oscarfestooned movie i personally love golden age hollywood musicals and had read all the press about its revamping the genre for the present  day somehow though it just didnt connect with usi did like the cinematography with its hopperlike depiction of lowrent hollywood from filmsets to restaurants and jazzclubs there were no sexscenes the camera work was fluid throughout and i appreciated the references to the past with the oldstyle titles and oldfashioned scenechanges toobut after that i struggled to relate to the characters ryan goslings character is determined to make his actress girlfriend like jazz and by extension the viewer but i know what i like and i didnt warm to the live club scenes with gosling immersing himself in his music likewise stones travails with her acting ambitions as she flunks screentests and takes a waitress job as she seeks her big break i didnt hate them i just didnt care for them the songs were okay i guess but sitting here a day after watching it none of them is still in my memory the setpiece choreographed numbers are likewise easy on the eye but again arent particularly memorable especially compared to those from yesteryear gosling and stone are okay in their roles and work hard at their singing and dancing but i didnt sense much chemistry between them i certainly didnt think i was watching hollywoods best actress of the year it probably helps to like and appreciate characters like this if youre in the entertainment industry otherwise they can come across as here as precious and vainmaybe im being too critical in invoking the great films it seems to draw upon for inspiration but the fact that it got decorated with six oscars the other day for me says something about the quality of competition today compared to earlier timesno if i want to see a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his ambitious girlfriend ill go back and watch new york new york,happy
like many others have said it is hollywood in love with itself well i didnt hate it but i certainly didnt love it i actually dozed off for a couple of minutes in the middle i love musicals i should write that in caps because i love musicals i especially love musicals with smart lyrics and a good plot this had neither the stars were nice thoughthis was like reading one of those sappy romance novels and to top it all off i didnt like the ending a happy ending would have been at least somewhat redeeming this ending was like trying to be real when none of the movie was remotely real blah oh how i miss rogers and hammerstein kender and ebb bob fosse and their like perhaps ill stick to broadway musicals,happy
i have to be honest and admit that musical is not my favorite type of movie but after all this good reviews and recommendation and all nominations for oscars i decided to watch it yesterday calling myself a movie fan i just had to see it to be able to say what i think oh i dont even know where to start i am so disappointed i do like the actors ryan gosling is great and emma stone is not bad also but that is the only positive in that film such a boring long and usual story nothing new nothing surprising total fail in my eyes i dont understand why people are so impressed by it and why or why we are going like backwards  why suddenly we like old fashion type of cinema that is mystery for me i am a woman so i do like good romance but even that was not the best ive seen have not much to say except i seen it its done will never watch it again very forgettable average movie shame,happy
one can say many things about writerdirector damien chazelles and indeed the critics plaudits and accolades have already infiltrated our national consciousness its a valentine to movie musicals its a musical for people who dont like musicals its a feelgood movie for all audiences its a tonic for our national malaise the storyseparated into seasonal chaptersis pretty basic emma stone is a barista on the warner bros movie lot who aspires to be an actress but cant get passed the audition phase ryan gosling is a jazz pianist who longs to play his own compositions they encourage each other to follow their dreams which doesnt necessarily mean taking the financially lucrative road although having money in the bank would certainly be an incentive for a better future even if the artistic value isnt there yet yes chazelle is in love with movieshe steals enough from the motion picture past to tell us thatand certainly the opening musical number on a jammed los angeles freeway is full of contagious acrobatic joy and celebration the trouble is these two young people arent willing to compromise perhaps that would be allowing for too much realism chazelle attempts to show us that success doesnt always lead to happiness yet his protagonists dont see the big picture starryeyed they want instant gratification through artistic expression the dancing is polished too polished i thought and the early numbers such as one with stone and her girlfriends have a sprightly quality that is oldfashioned in concept and charmingly lacking in pretension still the hardships of a romantic relationship pulled in different directions isnt all that interesting here mainly because gosling and stone seem so charmed and pictureperfect she trembles with a beginners desperation during her auditions and is convincingly unhappy when her onewoman show doesnt pan out but watching her out to dinner with an affluent date and his friends reveals nothing more than a princess eager to try another throne gosling has a moment or two when hes able to give us a natural response to a line or situation but his concern for stone seldom registers the brightlypainted film is reaching for a certain heighta plastic paradise a movie heaventhat will flood us with good feelings in its attempt and break our hearts with its climax however if you are not invested in these characters by the midway point it will all seem like a glossy charade  from ,happy
is summed up in its title and is a direct reflection of celebrity obsessed america it will rate highly with those who dont have a real job are highly overpaid or the antideplorables elitist gentrified sanctimonious city folk it is bland directionless scripted dribble with good actors playing bad parts and acting badlyhollywood has lost its way repeats of old ideas a plethora of movies without real plots without good scripts having any real meaning or with mediocre tv learned method acting talent not all films have to be great films everyone likes escapism at times and we dont expect a citizen kane a godfather or blade runner all the time however what is criminal is if we treat this film above its real status which unfortunately appears to be the case based on its imdb rating,happy
in a word turgid given the hype i had expected an upbeat colourful allsinging  dancing romp boy was i disappointed save your money and take your loved one for a couple of beers insteadthe opening traffic jam songdance sequence was a nighon unintelligible uninspiring mess that added pointless minutes to what turned out in any case to be an overlong film from there on we limp though a lacklustre passionless romance until we reach an ambiguous ending there are a couple of cute songs along the way the dancing is disappointing especially if youre thinking of something along the lines of fred astaire  ginger rogers ironically the high spot for me was the sequence where ryan goslings character is playing keyboards in a pop band something that conflicts with his jazzbased musical values goslings character seemed mildly depressed throughout which is not appealing and although stone can act convincingly theres a limit to how much big eyed gazing i can take when good films end an audience will be buzzing with conversation with smiles on faces this one ended with silent shuffling there was a palpable sense of disappointment did wives feel guilty for dragging their husbands to such a turkey and did husbands fume at losing 2 hours of their lives which could have been spent watching homes under the hammer on tv,happy
since won 7 golden globes here is me comparing it to 7 wellreceived movies from past years also giving my own awards1 it is like boyhood 2014 in terms of average if you dont know boyhood is the most average movie ever made gets the most average movie since boyhood award from me2 in terms of characters it is lot like another romance from 2012 called silver linings playbook if the characters from that movie didnt have personalities they could be main characters in 3 in terms of songs it is the opposite of les misrables 2012 the ost is either popular meme songs original content which lacks completely and utterly in lyric creativity or jazz which varies from this is why i dont like jazz to i should listen to more jazz4 the second award i will give to is i will forget everything that happened in it in a week award this movie is about as memorable and livechanging as james camerons avatar from 2009 it lasted some hours and later on the time spent watching it is worth as much as random hour from 15 years ago when you were bored and kicked rocks while waiting school buss to arrive it happened but can you go into details about it no most likely not time spent averagely 5 in terms of conclusion the movie is like whiplash 2014 they both even have jk simmons the main difference being that whiplashs ending was the pinnacle of the story wheres ending was flat like earth according to some 6 in terms of atmosphere the movie is like caf society 2016 from woody allen excepts changes from this is supposedly cheerful to supposedly emotional while cafe society was more like if you see any differences in atmosphere during these 15 hours you most likely have serious case of paranoid schizophrenia 7 now this is acting how did emma stone beat meryl streep her performance in florence foster jenkins 2016 was easily the most impressive sole performance seen in 2016 she carried that whole movie alone emma stone only impressed me twice while trying to convey feelings by directly starting into the camera during jazz scenes the second time wasnt even that good because it was just repetitive also i lied this movie didnt really change anything,happy
given my love of both movies and musicals i had such high hopes forbut alas it was not to bethe good news is that the cast and production values are excellent ryan gosling and emma stone are as likable as can be and the staging of the production numbers is amazingah but theres bad news theres just no chemistry between gosling and stone and since their relationship drives the movie this is a serious problem another problem is that neither of them are very good singersand then theres the musical numbers which just feel amateurish my mom can make the costumes well use your dads garage and well write the musical numberslast but not least at 218 it goes on forevertheres no good reason to see this movie at all if youre curious wait for the dvd  streaming and then watch it with the sound off as you read a good book,happy
i like movie musicals like west side story mamma mia or even mary poppins so i was really looking forward to seeing this movie  especially after the great opening on the highway unfortunately my expectations were disappointed just because everyone says that the movie is great it doesnt mean it isfirst of all the plot is not very interesting mia emma stone works in a coffee shop but wants to become an actress she falls in love with jazz pianist sebastian ryan gosling whom she meets roughly 10 times by chance sebastian tries to save jazz and convinces mia that jazz is the best music in the world at the end mia gives up her dream while sebastian creates a successful jazz club since there is so little action much of the time theres boring conversation and a lot of clichs at the end a different shortened version of the movie is presented where the protagonists are always successful it was so hard to watch it to the endsecond the singing and dancing was mediocre emma stone performed better than ryan gosling but that isnt hard none of them are professional singers or dancersthird theres the music google says there are 28 songs but some of the themes are used in very many different songs maybe i would have been overwhelmed by the music if it wasnt that repetitive but city of stars or mia and sebastians theme were played so often that i was really annoyed when i had to hear it the fifth timeall in all i cant recommend this movie if you are a jazz lover there are some music scenes that might interest you but you can also watch them on youtube,happy
it was such a below average movie one thing expected of a musical is great music music that you come out humming but it could not give me one there are only occasional pieces of piano and jazz which were nicethe opening score was so long and horriblei really hated the motionblur effect in the movie the characters were the typical la artists struggling there was nothing to the characters no complexity with the characters no complexity in the relationships between characters ryan gosling was a really bad singer it was too long for the content i kept watching my phone to know the time almost slept during the movie,happy
after rave reviews and the golden globes theres now an oscarbafta buzz attached to sorry to rain on the big parade but i was not blown away yes theres some charm here with all the homage to the golden age of romantic musicals and ryan gosling remains the most charismatic of todays young stars but the music simply isnt musical enough gosling and emma stone can just about carry a song and do a bit of amateur hoofing but really the singing is nearly as ragged as it was in the screen version of les miserables and the dancing is about as far from fred astaire and gene kelly as the first round of dancing with the starsok kelly and astaire and ginger rogers and other costars of theirs did not have great singing voices but they were fantastic dancers and the songanddance numbers in their movies were never less than dazzling the closest comes to dazzling is in the final routine a lowrent tribute to an american in paris but it just doesnt have enough dazzle as musicals go fings aint what they used to be the jazz club scenes hit the only high spots gosling really looks as if hes creating magic on the piano but theres no magic in his singing or his dancing  nor in stones who alas doesnt have her costars redeeming charisma the lovestory has a certain amount of charm but like the music it could do with a bit more zingthe golden age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to rebel without a cause but nostalgia just isnt enough and theres too much clunkiness on display here they say there isnt the money to create great musicals like we had in mgms heyday surely it would take only a fraction of the budget for a cgiheavy action movie or space opera to hire some firstrate dancers and singers who can act  or if we must actors who can sing or mime to a better singer singin in the rain cannot have been a bigbudget production but its still the greatest of the greats,happy
ive joined the hype train and i got really burned this film was mostly bad how in the world it won so many awardsfirst of all e s and r g cant sing to save their lives e s got only one song which she really sang using her chest voice and i dont really think it was her voice because of the discrepancy of what she sang previously up to that point this film has no plot its like a musical version of fifty shades of grey without the action distilled for kids reaching really cringeworthy moments the love story is a hollywood clich sterile and devoid of any real meaning or connection to reality im really confused about the music since this is what ive been doing for the past twenty years to make a living most of the songs are somewhat immature in the composition manner while their arrangements are quite beautiful they are not close to how a true pedigree musical should sound like they feel like the cheap version for a true musical especially considering that the film goes to great lengths to substitute the ineptitude of the lead actors  singers with many many instrumental parts that most of the time feel inadequate even though the orchestration and the mixing in theory is flawless the whole movie revolves around just one melodic motif which gets overused really fast most of the arrangements are well executed yet simplistic in manner with mostly appearance over essence its like reading a childrens book for me that illustrates overreaching without the necessary experience or profoundness to fully grasp the important concepts one is trying to say the elements that constitute the movie just dont synergize good enough with each other to make it work however there are several jazz arrangements that stand out of the crowd and theres even a pop song which is pretty dope i think it was the high point of the movie the film digs deep into its technicality to recreate the look and feel of the golden age of american cinematography it uses almost all the tricks in the book they dress the extras in very earthy colors and the leads in bright and vivid colors so they can really stand out the use of silhouettes a lot of floodlight reminiscent of carbon arc lightning classic red green blue primaries color palette which is a true beauty to behold in several scenes they used old anamorphic lenses they color graded the footage as to be reminiscent of the glorious technicolor age and its 3 strip process the sets are beautiful all this requires tremendous work and it really shines throughout the film the team that was in charge of the technical aspects is top notch first class hands down no question and here lies the true sadness what it is and what it could have been has many nods to different classic films it clearly pays respects to gene kelly and fred astaire and here lies another big problem those guys were gods with shoes on compared to them r g is a world class grade a dilettante hes a good actor whatever but his dancing skills reminds me of that show dancing with the stars at most which i always zapped away from the film pays respects and nods at many old classics while itself achieving nothing except basking in a pool of mediocrity and worse its getting big time rewarded for it no thats just wrong its a disturbing trend and a symptom of a much greater and complex problem our society suffers from its like antivaxers for artthe ending is the lowest point for this film im obviously not spoiling it but it will leave you wanting your money back for me it was the killing blow if theres a word to describe this whole experience its kitsch for a comedy its barely funny and apart from the technical aspects which are really good there is very little of movie metamaterial that could hold up under close scrutiny when compared to the great classics or even other modern musicals for that matter im sorry,happy
love these actors several of my favorites of all time even though they are much younger than i wanted to watch a movie that would be uplifting and just mellow me out the beginning of the movie  i must admit  didnt grab my interest or raise my endorphin level by much  but didnt give up on three of my favorite actors  jk simmons emma stone ryan gosling  they are all among my favorite actorsand at last  they finally enter the heart of the movie where the script began to rock and grab you by the heart and soulthen in the final scene  it is all ripped from you  your happy and mellow mood is kicked a good one it all leaves you i am at the end of the movie so madwhy didnt someone warn me i dont understand what was the writer thinking did they intentionally want to put me in a depressed state of mind i must say  emma stone has a beautiful voice and i loved every minute of watching her really loved her character and how she developed it ryan gosling plays the piano fantasticallywow as a once upon a time ballerina who also picked up tap and jazz  i was very impressed with their dancingloved it jk simmons is one of the few actors who can take a small part and deliver greatness they never disappointed me  the script didi still love emma and ryan and jk but the screenwriter  i will watch out for in the futureto make sure i never pay to see another of his screenplays,happy
i must be from another planet this film which did so well at the recent oscars made me painfully aware that my taste is much different from those who gave it such a good ratingi like musicals but found this not to be one what story was there to see i watched the movie on disc and found the dancing in the traffic jam at the start a load of rubbish and hurtful to watch i battled on watching but after almost half an hour scanned through to the end the flashing picture before my eyes was no different when watching the movie the same scenes over and over againif the movie had anything in its favor i missed this completely oh well i saved about 2 hours of pain thanks goodness i am still sane after this experience i give it a rating of 2 because of not having seen the movie at normal speed otherwise it would probably be a 1,happy
spoiler alert this review details the end of the film so best avoided until after viewing or not bothering to view the filmthe problem with as i see it is exactly the same as arrivali spent a couple of hours getting into the film only to discover that the ending made the rest of the film completely irrelevant which sort of abuses my trust in spending money and time on the picturein all honesty who would make a film about their relationship with their ex most people have a past love who went on to happily marry someoneelse would you really want to celebrate that fact in film i dont think soi left the cinema thinking that sebastian had thrown away the best thing that ever happened to him a reason to celebrate i dont think soalso five years later mia has met courted and married someoneelse and had a baby who looked two years old she cant have missed sebastian that much then as she was supposedly spending the first of those five years making and publicizing a film that gave her just over a further year before getting pregnant for nine months hmmm10 years later would have been more realisticall in all a well made film but a waste of my time money and emotional investment in the characters,happy
very mediocre and totally unforgettable songs sung by actors not singers not good dancers trying hard with bad choreographythe story is pitifully bland with no real credible plot and an even worse ending i know many people have rated this highly far too highly in my opinion but to balance that i have heard from many people who were so very disappointed and some even left during the film the 110 is because of the very high mark it has maybe i should have given a more reasonable mark 210 no more just over 2 hours of my life lost that i cannot ever get back i think maybe it is a kings new clothes where people just follow the bandwagon frightened to say the movie was and still is pretty bad,happy
just saw this at tiff and had a fantastic time solid 8510 having seen and loved whiplash  i was really looking forward to damien chazelles next movie the fact that it would be a musical with ryan gosling and emma stone just made me super impatient to watch it oh i also love jazz so that just made it pretty much perfect expectations were sky high from this team and boy did they meet themand then some the trailer was beautiful from its colours to the soundtrack to the fact that it didnt give away any of the story and it really was just the trailer since the movie and its music totally blows you away the themes it explores  though not new are relatable for anybody and the way the story is told really makes an impact ryan gosling and emma stone were really impressive with their dancing and singing ive always loved how natural their acting is as well and this movie was no different thoroughly enjoyed both their performancesthe lead characters may be struggling in certain fields but it is their dreams they are chasing at the end of the daysomething we all have done or are in the process of doing this makes you quickly feel like you know these people and what theyre going through throw in some comedy love drama and magical soundtracks as well as sequences and you have yourself a masterpiece i really havent seen anything like this in a very long time damien chazelle has proved himself again and is definitely someone to lookout for for years to come,happy
movie starts on a great note but looses steam in between the director could have done something about this there are scenes in between why you start feeling the protagonist is acting in the movie its a good movie no doubt but i was comparing this to all time classic musical hit the sound of music director should have retaken some scenes to have a smooth flow between the eventsfor ex the way mia ditches her ex makes no sense she just runs away to see a movie with a new guy  crazy sebastian is having dinner with miathe dialogues look so forced on to the audience  compare the other romantic moviesthe notebook or 50 first dates the feel that you get after watching the movieit stays on for few hours i liked the idea of the ending but again looks very disconnected 5 years not in touch  what came in between them for those 5 years  ego or plain interest lost between them  dont try to pull a nolan here,happy
i was excited to see this movie but as soon as it started i could tell it wasnt going to be great the costumesclothing in the movie were utterly hideous i have no idea who dressed these people but whoever that person happens to be i want to ask them what the hell they were thinking could they dress her in any more unflattering clothes it looked like an anthropology nightmare ryan and emma also had absolutely no chemistry whatsoever yes the dancing was ok but i would hardly call what they did singing it was more like talking lastly the ending was pretty awful 2 hours of my life wasted the only people i would recommend this movie to would be ppl who like jazz or people that like musicals across the universe was slaughtered by reviewers and critics but it my opinion it was ten times better than this supposed musical,happy
there was a time that to be in a musical you had to have talent you might be able to dance like fred astaire or gene kelly or at least if your dancing were suspect you might be able to sing like sinatra or streisand or at least like meryl streep but is a perfect millennial movie where everyone who shows up gets a trophy for trying today we tend to confuse talent with fame as long as you have the right q score and can pull in the right demographic then thats all you need even in the day of the dinosaur when they made west side story they at least made sure the featured players were made to look good by surrounding them with professionals gosling has the requisite bona fides as heart throb especially when paired with emma stone and has some musical skill but he is dancing on his fame here which is probably enough for todays audiences the movie looks good and if you like splashy over saturated color then there are some visuals for you to enjoy if you were a fan of the tv show pushing daisies no doubt this film will be a fav wth would be auteurs and wanna be broadway dancers however i found it a romantic yawn but the chic flic crowd will drag their dates to see it be sure you bring a phone and ear buds,happy
this is basically a typical and predictable film which is typical broadwaythe acting is poor overall and the dance sequences appear to be far too similar in the cherographythe ending may not have been typical but its not worthy of even being nominated for an oscar let alone winning,happy
this movie begins with great promise and for the first thirty minutes or so i thought this could be a really great movie an homage to old hollywood a whimsical oldfashioned musical set in contemporary la some of the musical sequences during the first half of the movie are truly wonderful but it feels like this movie is in two halves  the second half of the movie is sad depressing unengaging and devoid of any of the lustre or magic of the first half the story becomes clunky the characters are not interesting anymore it was turning into blue valentinethe musical  i started to question the motives of the filmmakers what exactly are they trying to achieve here get people to see a modern movie musical and then turn it into a slow protracted break up movie the icing on the cake was the end musical sequence showing what could have been if the two main characters had stayed together i was thinking whats the point of this  it doesnt matter that they didnt stay together they both attain great success they both followed their dreams  why then show an extended sequence which comes across as if only they had stayed together look what would have happened it seemed pointless and really unmoving considering what i think the filmmakers were trying to do but in the end it doesnt matter what the director was hoping to achieve its already a huge success its a star vehicle with alist actors and it will win all the awards because its an oscar winning movie but i know im not alone in my opinion of this film as an audience member and that really is all that matters to me,happy

im completely baffled on all the hype around this the awards and it beats me why people write those 10star reviewsi love these actors music musicals old and new settings classics good jazz romance  practically everything that was used to mix up this film yet it fell short of being enjoyable by a mile or tenthe musical part has just one song really and while it returns 34 times cant carry a 2 hours sitting and there are good parts not even few but put together add up to maybe 15 minutes definitely less than 202016 was a really bad year for cinema but even there 15 good content can not put you on the short list or the long listalso it looks like shot directly for ipad watching nothing in it requires to be in a movie theater and beyond a handful of minutes of piano and jazz parts even speakers are not to be missedso if you absolutely want to watch it i recommend do it at home equipped with food partner other distractions and a fastforward button but if you skip it altogether you hardly lose anything eitherreal shame wasting all that talent and more so fueling the hype and reinforcing the bad trend that keeps actually good pictures from being financed,happy
when you finally thought the critics couldnt get worse well in this movie we have music singing romance drama and extremely childish comedyi would never really call it comedy like any other chick flick yeah it is confirmed that 85 of all movie critics are brain dead faggots because people just made this movie officially the best movie in the world i dont want to live in a world like that this movie makes me ashamed to be human and i would rather die as a stray dog by the age of 2 then say that this movie is close to good dont watch it if you consider yourself to be sane in the brain because if you do your brain and all sense in there will gone long gone half way into the movie 010,happy
sent the cinematic world into a frenzy and i cant quite say i understand the hype a musical in 2017 is bound to send people into a frenzy of excitement anticipation and nostalgia however i think it was a bit over done the beautiful dance scene after the party was a scene well though out enough to get all of our 1950s musical senses tingling however didnt the iphone ring just ruin it i can see what the filmmakers are trying to do here but isnt it a bit overbearing and too ironic irony is best served subtly although the songs were captivating and both actors delivered beautiful performances and i wont forget about it any time soon worth seeing even if it is to just be a bit confused by the concept,happy
this film is a bit overhyped 14 oscar nominations seriouslyi saw this film yesterday and im pretty sure it wont stick with me for a very long time the story is too flimsy it misses edge plot drama it misses depthi was tricked by the beautiful and inspiring trailer which summarizes the film actually i was also tricked by the misses who really really wanted to see this film which she didnt like as much as she thought she wouldto go short positive aspects of theme song performance of emma stone scenery and colorsnegative aspects of flimsy scenario without much edge inconsistencies sappy songs besides theme song and average film all in alli wouldnt even call this film a musical because there isnt that much music in the film and definitively not enough jazzthree people walked out of the cinema yesterday out of 15 people hardly a sign that this is a mustsee movie no,happy
whats bringing this film praise and attention is how this type of movie has not been created in recent years but beyond this fact lies the qualities of a great movie that were just not presentsacrificed plot line superficial weak casting obvious techniques convoluted range of styles and random classic film referencescasting come on emma stone is no debbie reynolds neither stone nor gosling are dancers which means they wouldve had to learn how to for the role albeit it was not a disaster but it was certainly not memorable which it be should for a 14 oscar nominated musical musical remember jk simmons from whiplash 2014 was his role in a cameo not quite but it was an absolute wasteprotagonists i thought seeing from the trailer sebastian was going to be the energetic doesntcareabouttherulesjustcaresabout thepassion kind of guy who encourages mia which he is at the beginning of the film however this attitude fades and the reason wasnt made clear enough miscommunication between mia and seb halfway through the film we never see his passion anymore inconsistency growth but from whateveryone else either the director was deeply trying to focus on just mia and sebastian or all the other characters in the film were swept aside equivalents to npcs from the sims dancing was not abundant nor top notch revolved around head turns and fancy runningsoundtrack the best component of the movie i love nothing more than mia and sebastians epilogue theme every other official theme of the film was also absolute brilliance simple dreamy elegant sincere potentially iconic was also a beautiful motif plot line between predictable and difficult to recall predictable due to its romantic genre difficult to recall because it was overshadowed by the films aesthetic focus sebastians scene where he sang city of stars  a 45 minute scene of just him singing on the pier  had no meaning and said nothing about anyone or anything great song though about half way  23 into the film all excitement was lost and i was bored boredom peaked at mias audition where she spoke about her aunt all in all not memorable nor something someone would compliment the film on excluding its twist endingtwist ending the what could have been sequence was truly emotionally significant honest and genuinely bittersweetmoral i was impressed by how intensely the film focused on the reality of stardom in theater and the arts  even down to the nuances of rejection  when mias audition is rudely interrupted by a casting director wanting a sandwich  it truly touches the core of how quietly brutal it is to receive nothing after giving it your all in complete vulnerability which is why i was disappointed when the writers abandoned this message nearing the end by slapping on a five years later time skip giving mia the life of a successful movie star sebastian his jazz club to dwindle the moral of the film to something like love doesnt go the way you imagined it would because romance is everything film techniques effectively supported the popping visuals of the film however at times purposely or not it didnt deliver what was comfortable for audiences a full body shot that dragged on never cutting closer to the actors face a close up of the actors face for too uncomfortably long the use of crescendos cutting to black were over used became annoying see when whiplash 2014 used this for its sudden ending that was perfect and it was the only time it happened the main tune motif was almost over used see when sebastian plays that tune at the end when he spots mia in the crowd for the first time after 5 years that was a perfect use of it cant say the same in all the other insignificant parts when it came up motifs library honking horn main tune  awesome clever visual effects the cloud scene was awkward to watch worst part of the film scenes where reality turned abstract became too obvious sudden lighting changes which were okay but then it happened too often characters sweeping across settings etc design spectacular retro feeling yet is clearly set in the present day therefore the 20th century car models and primary colour dresses were too clearly contrived unless we just happen to be viewing the lives of a minority population stuckobsessed with the 60s john legends appearance verdict overrated this film had a lot of potential it was an exciting concept films like this dont exist anymore but in truth it was flawed and overall weak however kudos to the hard work put into orchestrating and capturing mass choreographed dances in single shots truly visually stunning great film techniques successfully immerses audiences into its dreamlike world intensely honest look at the reality of love and artistic career paths original soundtrack  deserves the praise in every other area it could have been more,happy
this movie is overrated to say the leastbecause of the reception it had among critics and the amount of golden globe awards and academy awards nominations it got i thought this would be genius work a true masterpiecethats not exactly what this movie isfirst emma stone doesnt deserve best actress nomination she cant act if her life depends on it has no charisma no presence and in this movie she has the same mannerisms she had in that stupid teen movie easy a no effort at allryan gosling deserves the nomination but definitely does not deserve the award though his performance is convincing and pleasant its not amazing enough to be awarded with an oscar that being said spoiler alert the plot is basically this girl meets guy they fall in love girl wants to be a famous actress guy wants to have a jazz bar they both make bad professional choices in life which eventually make them fall apart years later girl is already a famous actress married and meets the guy in the jazz bar he founded boring casablanca reference anyone she obviously does not stay with him and the ending implies that they never saw each other again the end basically this is the plot in a nutshell now add some cringeworthy dancing and singing scenes some attempts to dance jazz and a vintage costume design and youll have whats called by most deluded critics a masterpiece dont waste your time watching this,happy
i love musicals but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i walked out with just ten minutes left because i couldnt take it any more it was a long boring story line with ok acting and unmemorable tunes bamboo shoots under my fingernails would have been less painful i dont get all the awards and nominations,happy
come on people step back a bit and get some perspective on this show  put aside the hollywood hype the story here  trying to make it big in la  has been done a million times and this attempt failed to show us anything new i respect ryan gosling as an actor i think he has great range and has shown this in many vastly differing roles drive the big short crazy stupid love the place beyond the pines gangster squad lars and the real girl fracture but he is not a song and dance man emma stone is a competent actor ive never seen her do anything badly but nothing that would promote her to my a list and she should leave song and dance alone as well even the fantasy scenes were nothing new or special i thought the ending was something new and very well done but thats about it the story boring and ordinary was presented at a snails pace i overheard someone near me in a packed theater by the way say oh come on get on with itif you want to see a real musical dig through your old dvds for cabaret and sweet charity both musicals that owe nothing to anything that came before and stand as living tributes to the genius of bob fosseim not listening to the hollywood hype and marking this at a 3 barely worth watching on dvd,happy
i was curious to watch this one as i am a big fan of musicals well i was disappointed all this movie did was make me nostalgic of old classics like singing in the rain this film did not have anything new to add to a long line of amazing movies of this genre i felt like all the clichs from the cinema history were recycled in order to create a plotline for although the acting on both protagonists was really amazing there was not much they could have done to begin with because the story lacked so much depth i liked the concept that this was a story about finding the courage to achieve your dreams but the script was just poorly written the director tried to combine digital effects with the musical atmosphere of the old hollywood but all this did was make the film even less unimpressive instead of focusing on effects he should have put as much effort to create realistic characters honestly the only thing i enjoyed about this film was the dancing scenes and although i liked them it still felt unoriginal and lacking it felt like they just copied one of fred astaire and ginger rogerss movies also one of the things that really bothered me was the cinematography i was really amazed they filmed the opening sequence with such hard natural light if they had filmed the same thing a few hours before when the sunlight was softer the results would have been a hundred percent better as for the constant hard lightning at the piano playing scenes it didnt allow me to see the actors facial expressions and that annoyed me especially at the emotionally charged moments i felt that the director of photography had not an ounce of artistic touch here the cinematography of this film is completely forgettable to sum things up in my opinion all this movie did was copy old classics poorly it was not executed well and it lacked the most important element of all film magic if i were you i would not spend my money to see this at the cinema,happy
im a big fan of musicals  on film and in the theater  so i had high hopes for combine its genre with the fact that it seemed like a love note to the great city of los angeles always a rich backdrop for a film and i was eager to see this movie i was sorely disappointed first the casting of gosling and stone is all wrong neither can sing or at least certainly not well enough to make the many musical numbers enjoyable the dancing in the film is basic and didnt hold my attention including in the muchlauded opening number so if neither gosling nor stone fit the bill based on their musical abilities maybe their onscreen chemistry would explain their roles in this picture not even close i couldnt believe for a second that these characters really loved one another there was no credible romance between them id go so far as to call their relationship awkward stone for her part delivers her lines very well and has much more range as an actor than gosling who no matter how many movies i see him in always seems to be playing a caricature of himself but her talent isnt enough to save the film then there is the plot there is very little of it the movie clocking in at just over 2 hours feels like 3 so little attention was paid to story and so much paid to fetishizing midcentury hollywood filmmaking that i couldnt help by feel the film dragging and stumbling from one poorly written set piece to another without succeeding at captivating my interest at any point for example goslings character is set up as a downandout struggling musician without an ounce of opportunity or luck on his side what then explains his seemingly effortless rise in the film as he scores a gig playing with musicians he used to swoon for as a spectator or the way he suddenly hops into national stardom by partnering with john legends highly successful band there is nothing that really explains his characters quick transition from bitter failure to jazz superstar there is a charming final songanddance number in but it comes too late to save the movie overall is a halfbaked pastiche of a movie with forgettable music lackluster dancing thin story and insincere character development skip it,happy
a boring story with boring music it was painfully long the praise heaped on it leaves me in disbelief except that hollywood loves hollywood emma stone is the latest in line of anorexic looking actresses i felt scammed by the reviews into watching it longer than i felt any interest in doing so the characters didnt engage and the music didnt please,happy
these five stars go only to the actors themselves who were phenomenal and also genuinely touching as singersthis film left me feeling like most hollywood films do  like eating several packages of skittles in one sitting after suffering through the unbelievably nauseating script which turns what could be a very beautiful and romantic story into probably the most boring uninspired relationship ive ever seen i still couldnt get one thing out of my headwhat does any of this music have to do with jazz or musicals everything i heard was thinly veiled pop music chords with trumpets or saxophones to disguise them there was no joy in any of the melodies nothing touching whatsoever about emma stones solo just purely banal lifeless chord progressionsthis film is not art the same way skittles are not food but at least skittles dont market themselves as a wordclass meal which is honest unlike this widely acclaimed masterpiece that betrays the aspirations of art entirely,happy
words i heard from so many people about this movie prior to seeing it was epic spectacular classic i was so excited to see it and had such high expectations going into this film especially since i just adore emma stone i was sadly disappointed i dont see what everyone else saw i did enjoy some of the singing and dancing also the desire to bring back the amazing and inspiring classics of original musicals this was all just so epically wrong where do i even begin the plot was not very inspiring but kinda boring the end was the worst ending to any movie of all time i really wanted to not only like this movie but love it i just cant it was meant to bring back the dead epic hollywood musicals of fred astaire but it was uninspiring and just altogether an epic failure for me this movie made me cry not notebook cry but like george cloony playing batman cry,happy
i unfortunately was dragged to this by a date i have seen two musicals hair and grease in my life that didnt make me want to vomit over the absolutely ridiculous notion that people burst out in song and dance at the drop of a hat this pos movie made me stand up and leave after 5 minutes needless to say there was no second date and to be frank i wouldnt suffer through this pile of steaming manure for the hottest woman in the world,happy
i was very disappointed with lah lah land as the story line was very thin a bit like sliding doors towards the end and to me it was very boring however the actors were very good particularly ryan gosling and some friends of mine enjoyed it i think at best this is a b grade movie that should be shown on fox or hbo,happy
wow i have rarely seen such disparity in viewers opinion about a critically acclaimed movie i scrolled through the first 50 reviews on this site and noted the scores out of 10 given by reviewers next to the score is the number of reviews from the 50  10 89 3 8 0 7 0 6 5 5 2 4 0 3 4 2 7 1 21 for the most part it seems that people either love or dislike it many intensely note out of the first 50 reviews the film has been given a rating of 1 on 21 occasions this is not a bad movie by any means for the main part it is a very well made production  editing lighting and direction are very good emma stone gives a great performance and ryan gosling if not equal to her in this department surely deserves huge accolades for his faultless mastery of a number of keyboard instrumentsthe problem with this film is that as a musical it lacks zing in the dance routines and vocal renditions both emma and ryan sing in tune which at least is passable but they are not vocal performers emmas singing is so brittle  understanding lyrics was difficult at times neither lead actor thankfully was vocally challenged in any way at allthe dance routines are really pale imitations of the greats of hollywoods past most obvious to me was the absence of any memorable tunes city of stars is the best of a very bland selection although i must admit that if any song could possibly have success as an energetic well performed number it would have to be start a fire john legends rendition was the musical highlight of the entire filmwhile i was not inclined like some other reviewers to walk out of the film it was most disappointing especially after have read rave reviews in the press surely it could not win best film oscar for fans of the two lead actors you will at least be rewarded emma is terrific whilst a more subdued ryan gosling will really impress you with his musical talent,happy
one of hollywoods worst clichs it is in my opinion a film without content made just to create box office receipts the music is painful to hear the performance of the actors leaves much to be desired and is full of errors not acceptable for a project of this magnitude the film is based on inspirations from other films which gives the sensation of already having seen it a film that was more concerned with its propaganda that the content itself even more revolting is knowing the attention and supposedly good criticisms that the film received which i dont understand the foundation of them a film that will surely be quickly forgotten and that will not change the world of cinema or the world itself,happy
la la lands pretty darn entertaining whodve ever thought hollywood could get america to love bollywood ingenious but i think it deserves special note for its unassailably politically correct sensitivity to every sort and sub sort of diversity anyone could conceive of and casting could supply about half way through i started imagining a small army of assistant directors behind the scenery during every crowd scene waiting to pounce onto the sets between takes to make sure that no other heterosexual monoracial couple except the two stars was anywhere near pulling focus ok hollywood we get it now what is everybody happy,happy
when do i finally realize that im not enjoying a particular movie this realization usually comes when a scene in the film reminds me of some other movie and i find myself longing to watch that film instead of the one i am desperately trying to enjoy in the case of this didnt take too longduring the duo dance scenes between emma stone and ryan gosling i found myself longing to watch fred astaire and eleanor powell during the jazz music scenes i found myself longing to put on some music from miles davis or dave brubeck damien chazelles souffllight screenplay made me long for some sort of story with substance lets face it even your longest allowable tweet would carry as much storytelling weight as this script when considering chazelles direction i found myself longing for a musical directed by vincent minnelli and while all this longing was going on i was longing for a shorter film is not a long production when compared with west side story or the music man and lets not make any further comparisons with those great films but it sure as heck seemed like a long long moviedictionarycom defines the phrase as a state of being out of touch with reality i wont disagree with that definition about halfway into this flick i was beginning to drift off into dictionarycoms interpretationluckily i had some severe arthritis pain in my right big toe that kept me alert long enough to long for some relief algesic or cinematic and to keep me awake long enough so that i could make a valid critique of this picture finally i long for the day when someone will make a musical thats even half as watchable as the last good hollywood musical  hairspray which really wasnt all that long ago was it,happy
while is certainly entertaining it isnt up to the level of expectations that critics and awards have been creating the first half hour suggests that this is going somewhere funamong others the scene of gosling playing the 80s piano man at a pool party is hilariousbut then it turns out to be an emotionally flat movie gosling and stone are great actors and superb at their jobs but the script turns out to have no tension and you find yourself not caring for whatever happens to them regardless of how much you may enjoy the dancing scenes which are clever to be correct and cool emma stone cant sing and i felt embarrassed at times gosling didnt bother me as much but the songs are really not interesting or catchy i cant remember any of them so as a musical id say fail of course i hadnt watched the trailer a zillion times the only scene were i could feel some emotional involvement with the story was at the very end with the parallel story thing i truly cannot understand all the accolades it is getting from movie experts unless they are all falling for its hollywood nostalgia as one critic said its the endless story about hollywood in love with itself,happy
the dancing was average at best the opening scene was the best routine these actors are not ginger and fred i am not sure if the talent was missing or something else the singing was either weak or mixed poorly the song writing was unique but not strong enough to remember the story line was predictable but sweet i was so looking forward to seeing a musical movie it has received great reviews because i believe those reviewers were all so desperate to see an upbeat musical love story as was i so in conclusion it is worth seeing if only to just to send hollywood a message with your dollars more of this but better quality please,happy
i was expecting a wonderful song and dance extravaganza with a great story wow was i ever disappointed i wanted to leave half way through it was so cheesy the big song and dance routines in particular were embarrassingly stupidi endured until the end but sadly it didnt even begin to recover my anticipatory enthusiasm the jazz was great john legend was great ryan gosling is a very attractive man and i enjoyed his singing and dancing and found his character very likable but thats all of the positives emma stones character has a vacuous narcissistic and superficial personality with little talent and no idea of real values i could not identify with her or feel any empathy at all for her plight i suspect many of those voting for the academy awards may be cast in a similar mould and therefore may have found it appealing there must be some explanation i cant believe anyone with roots in the real world would find this film particularly riveting or enjoyable hence my one star rating,happy
this movie was the longest 2 hours of my life the songs are nice at best which dont make it up to the fact that nothing happens in this movie no plot just long boring done by with mediocre actors the entire plot of the movie could have fit into ten minutes the only good part of this movie was the music this was the most boring movie i have ever seen total waste of time do yourself a favor and go see something else,happy
this movie was terrible from the opening numberdance sequence to the horribly nonsensical ending full disclosure i really wanted to love this movie as it droned on i wanted to like it by the end i was hoping all involved never made a musical again in short the dancing was amateurish the acting was subpar and it literally had no memorable songs unless you count awful singing i wouldnt be that outraged if this movie wasnt being hailed as the musical to bring back musicals i was generous with the 2 rating because i actually enjoyed the jazz instrumentals if anyone would like a spoiler filled review i would be glad to share and prove my findings to be true,happy
im sorry but goslings singing was atrocious unfortunately he wasnt the only person in this movie whose singing was not good enough for a musical production right from the opening scene you are confronted with actors who wouldnt make it past the first casting round of a broadway show dont get me wrongi like emma stone but she doesnt fit the role of young aspiring actress anymore which makes her something of a miscast the story is plain boring and the dialogue is bland who wants to see gosling agonizing about the nature of jazz music in long scenes drawn out like old chewing gum followed by semineurotic love interest scenes which seem to pass for convincing romance these days i guess two people who qualify for couples therapy sessions after just having met is the new normal the cinematography is great and the director really knows how to paint moving pictures but its all form and no substance making it the musical equivalent of a michael bay action movie in my opinion this is one of the most overhyped and overrated movies in many years,happy
i gave this movie a 310 in an effort of making it have an appropriate overall rating the movie lacks good singing dancing and script contrary to most musicals it has no real memorable scene that defines the movie main actors do a great acting job but their additional skills dancing  singing are subpar in my opinion if you like musicals dont expect much from this movie which i would believe should have a 610 overall if youve never seen many musicals this movie might be refreshing if it is follow it up by watching the top rated musicals here in imdb like singin in the rain mary poppins sound of music american in paris etc,happy
this is not a good movie although it might be a good musical i cannot be sure as i am not into musicals i wanted to watch this for its drama and beauty and comedyi could only bear a little more than an hour when i realized i could not watch this anymore there was almost no comedy and the drama was boring and oldthe opening was boring the singing was average some scenes were illogical i just cannot understand how this thing could become so popular and i still cannot believe how my action movieliking friends actually liked despite beautiful cinematography and excellent acting this does not deserve to be on imdbs top 250 movies listthe makers of this movie could take the script and go to broadway and make money off the musical,happy
i am not prone to swear or violence or hyperbole but when i got up from my seat in the theatre my first thought was that i would love to find some way to tell the guy who created this picture a very loud epithet regarding his need to procreate with himself  then i thought about punching him in the face i will gladly say the former but the latter is im afraid just hyperbole you see im old  65  and the visual beauty of this pic along with the fun music singing and dancing leads were acceptably weak in that department because their acting and the story carried them and an old fashioned love story with a happy endingeeeeeeescreeching of tires here wait a minute  did you just say happy ending well an oldtimer who is carried along with this joy ride expects them to resolve career problems and well all be together forever leaving the theatre in these horrible these in which we are living with at least one good thing to smile and be happy about thats what one is led to believe up to about 7 minutes from the end where you are sucker punched with a feeling of  wait a minute whats happening here uh oh this is gonna end badly no hold on  this dreamy sequence means this sly devil tricked us  they will get together  dreamy sequence ends  lovers look longingly at each other one last time  rug pulled out  the end like i said  go procreate with yourself yeah yeah  i know  a tragedy reflects real life  oscars dont give awards to musicals  bah,happy
is not a topnotch musical in the company of great musicals like west side story an american in paris gigi the sound of music i could go on and on its a wannabe musical that seems to owe its appeal by being seen as an homage to these earlier musicals  without being a worthy musical on its own merit apparently given its high rating its also being rated by people who havent seen these great musicals to realize how bad ison the positive side emma and ryan are very nice eye candy and do some nice acting which helps to redeem this movie from being a complete waste but this is a musical where leads need to sing andor dance and perhaps our culture has gotten so used to watching nonsingers sing and nondancers dance in tv shows such as dancing with the stars that its completely appropriate to have the two leading characters be people who can neither sing nor dance but lets not pretend  emma stone and ryan gosling cannot sing or dance musically there really isnt a ton of music although it started off looking like a musical with a big production number theres very little music in the middle of the movie a few of the songs are appealing but none are showstoppers or particularly memorable no one would hum a tune from when leaving the theater and although musicals tend to have songs that reflect the storyline has mostly done away with that convention oh that must be why its gotten awards instead we have a few songs used as themes that are repeated in the movie what about the story its really a fairly standard romantic trope but without the standard ending oh thats got to be worthy of an award the movie is also rather long  someone should have edited it a lot the cinematography seemed fake too much color and i hated the camera work  handheld dizzywork in some scenes and too too many closeups of emmamost people feel compelled to see given the number of awards and nominations but its not really worth the time go rent grease or cabaret instead,happy
right with the studio logos this movie takes us back to the golden age of cinema  and then it immediately turns into a ridiculous lovely dancinguponcars lively songin general i liked this movie sadly it is way too overhyped it has a lot of fun songs the cinematography is beautiful and i certainly understand what the movie wanted to do  but i didnt connect with itanother movie looking back fondly at the old movies was hail caesar and many people disliked it but somehow they love even though it tried to do the exact same thing apart from the love story of coursewhat was the worst about this movie for me was that the main character  seb played by ryan gosling  was basically just a singing and dancing noah from the notebook i thought noah was an insufferable prick and seb is no better basically he is the quintessential mopey entitled romantic artist who is just so poor because everyone ignores his art oh woe is me and mia is just a musical version of allie just as annoying and entitled as wellthis movie is very pretty to look at and it is a good example of how to make a nice nostalgic piece with great tunes that will undoubtedly bring a smile to your facethe characters are just too unbelievable though are we really supposed to accept that seb is simply a misunderstood artist and mia despite never having put any work into playwriting despite once watching casablanca in her early youth suddenly is some dramaturgical prodigy all while the two of them have the most basic pretentious ohlookatmeimsoedgytype conversations that if heard in real life would earn nothing more than an exasperated eyerollthe fact that most of their relationship went unshown was explained to me as mental shortcuts by the writers but truthfully if all i get to see from a relationship is a quick montage a fight and a weird galaxydancing scene i cant really regard it as anything but sillynot to mention that followed two plot tropes that i just cant stand in movies especially romantic ones them being a cheating on your man youre a woman in love its fine b overhearing a conversation and then assuming thingsregarding a so mias had this runofthemill uptown boy and of course he deserves to be left at a dinner because hes just not noah why couldnt mia just have been single would it have really made such a difference it perhaps wouldve shortened the picture by 10 minutes and saved me from my projected guiltregarding b there we have noah listening to a conversation that mia has with her mother about steady jobs and artistry and he immediately assumes that yes that means she wants me to take that for some reason obviously bad job that i dont want and im not gonna talk to her about it only months later will i flip my sht over it when she mentions it good logic there noahdespite this movie trying its hardest at being cool and artsy and all about the dreamers i just couldnt suspend my disbelief people like that dont act like that and they dont achieve things like that  not even in movie the best thing real life noah and allie the musical versions too could hope for would be shattered dreams and bitternessall of this is not say that movies about pretentious misunderstood dreamers cant be inspiring and brilliant they can and they often are as it seems that a lot of movies challenge this topic for me personally just tried too hard they were too targeted they pandered too much ironically all i could do is advise them to get more realregardless of my qualms with this movie anyone who is finds really nice music and goldenage nostalgia entertaining will certainly enjoy this motion picture as did i in the end its not as bad as some people suggest but its certainly not as good either,happy
ryan gosling they may as well of had a piece of driftwood acting opposite stone this guy is so useless i was embarrassed for him to start with he sounds retarded is he his serious face makes him look constipated i was half expecting him to let one rip the entire way through ive seen stroke victims with a wider range of expressions than him hes so vanilla lame boring possessing a total lack of charisma the best reviews he ever had were for roles with barely no lines moody films like the place beyond the pines and drive when all he had to do was sulk if he wins an oscar for on the back of this performance it will be an absolute travesty he cant sing he cant dance and literally sucks the life out of every scene hes involved innow emma stone is lovely shes sweet but one dimensional in that shes always playing the same character this was a gross miscasting you cant help but pity her when she sings its like your 5 year old niece at a school play but worse no depth or range at all completely drowned out by the music in every scene she has some rhythm when it comes to dancing but the set pieces are so laughably childish its hard to gauge her true capabilities clearly dumbed down to accommodate goslings lack of talent to make matters worse time has not been kind to stone whatever youthful looks she may or may not have had are long gone her face is beginning to morph into yet another plastic hollywood mess shes not hot shes not sexy but neither is gosling so i guess in that respect theyre evenly matchedthe script was ok stones character begins and ends the same with no progression mentally and goslingwell hes so boring you just give up caring however the rest of the cast were stellar john legend has some smooth vocals but he is rather oily had they cast people with real talent in the lead roles then i think this could have been magnificent worth mentioningthe cinematography was excellent visually stunning an orgy of colour bursting out from the screen in each and every scene and the songs although forgettable had a certain unique charm to them i predict a theatre production in the near futureto sum it up if your date makes you chose between this and titanic id chose this just dont go expecting it to live up to the hype peace x,happy
i do believe this is a really poor film with great budget and little artistic value poor script poor acting terrible consistency poor dancing  average musicthe reasons why the film is bad are so broad its hard to write an integrated bad review i will simply point a few selected terrible points of the film there are many more script  story is poor and predictable i spent half the film thinking the script was being ironic and that at some point the good stuff would start good stuff never came except maybe for the last 15 minutes which was an obvious crowdpleasing but it was pleasing indeed  music scenes are not memorable and often its hard to tell when they decide to shove them in and why no iconic dance or move will be remembered  ryan gosling pulls the same face throughout the film i found his comments on jazz shallow  hard to believe by no means he conveys proper love for anything hes ryan gosling playing himself and reusing his own set of gosling clichs hes believable or at least charming though when he tells emma to follow her dreams  emma stone has great acting moments for instance when shes auditioning and someone interrupts her but its only a few great glimpses in an incoherent ensemble her character is meant to be insightful and dreamy full of values and yet she has the shallowest of friends she forms a kind of tribe of husband huntergatherers who just meet to go out together so they dont look like weirdos they only reappear for applauding in a play regarding her preryan love life when you find out shes going out with the guy she keeps rolling her eyes on  who is consistently depicted as charmless and lame you just cant believe it theyre artificially put together to create her an epic icantput upwiththisanymorethejazzyguyismyguy scene in the restaurant which is embarrassing due to its impossible builtup this is an obvious one but the film is full of hard to believe stuff  no dance scene is memorable no twists no nuances no pushing limits no art  plot is childish  theyre both meant to succeed no success  youre lame at different paces  scripting is poor they go from a rough start total time of interaction  2 seconds in two episodes to 1 encounter where shes a bit funny and suddenly they go for a walk and switch from almost insulting each other to almost kissing just to be stopped by a telephone ringing no buildup no understanding of whats going on in their feelingsi could keep going on and on a film that would be average if it was shown after lunch on tv but is turned bad by artificial marketing expectationsexcuse my english,happy
i cannot remember being so bored in a theater my wife who loves romances told me later she considered leaving after the first 30 minutes which is sad because there are many good elements in the film and the story line though thin could have given us more reason for caring about the characters two young struggling artists meet fall in love but choose fame over love okay except there was no struggle unlike the thousands of people who do struggle to live a life in art these two must have had trust funds every sequence that could have given the characters more depth was swept away in a song which brings me to the other problem great musicals have great songs but the film had none though the jazz scenes were very entertaining the film did attain a level of excellence in the final scene sequence  a wistful musical imagining of what could have been if the film as a whole could have reached this level it would have been an excellent musical unfortunately it took an hour and a half before the film created sufficient context for the music and dance to have this level of relevance perhaps the films popularity can be accounted for by unfamiliarity with the genre music man or cabaret it was not,happy
i wouldnt say i tricked into seeing this but i had no idea before going that the film would be a nonsensical forgettable throwback style musical that was clearly written for the demographic mindset of 40 year old single women with three wine coolers in them it was clear that the story supposedly about jazz or theater or something was aimed at pasty white people who dont know the first thing about jazz or theater mix in a lot of forced chemistryfree smiling brutally crafted ideas for singing and dancing and a couple of outofplace f words to make it seem that this is supposed to also be a film for adults and you have a recipe for a bloated overrated piece of glittery junk that looks more like a thrift store basket filled with cheap deceased peoples jewelry than the most amazing film in decades i kept waiting for mary poppins style cartoon birds or penguins to show up get over yourself if think this was any better than the awful chicago which by the way was just as forgettable although it stupidly won an oscar and beat out several much better films the dumbest film i have seen in years thanks for the nap,happy
i really expected much more considering how much word of mouth this movie has got im a fan of ryan gosling and emma stone i love goslings lost river he wrote and directed and am looking forward to him in the new bladerunner moviethis movie seems to flirt with becoming something really good but never gets there the most memorable scene is in the observatory when they dance in the stars other than that the movie is flat the romance is never really realized and the story is weakthis is no epic romance its just a couple of people who knock around la become sort of lovers for a while and then go their separate ways its a strange subject for a musical theres nothing really new or original here and none of songs standoutthe choreography is so safe that theres no dynamism in any of the dance numbers they seem like a bunch of sequenced moves with none of fire or grace of a gene kelly or fred astaire musical i dont get the point of this why did they pick nondancer nonsinger gosling and the only marginally better singer dancer emma stone for this why the hell didnt they use channing tatum at least he can dance why didnt they get some a list talent to write the score frankly any one of thestep up movies even with their cheezy plots and sometimes embarrassingly bad acting kick this movies assthe best part of the movie was the banter between ryan and emma it seemed the only time there was a real spark of romance i thought it was going to explode from that instead just like the romance the movie fizzlesin a few years people will wonder what the fuss was all about,happy
look im sorry i really am i just dont get it ive seen snippets of reviews praising the movie and carrying on and on and on about the opening scene its won awards and emma stone is smoking hot as usual but honestly i dont understand it my wife and i sat down to watch it and lasted 30 minutes  just no idea what was going on didnt like any of the songs all of thatthis movie obviously isnt for us but im glad there are people it is for,happy
the camera work in some scenes is quite nice but the rest is just la la gosling and stone dont react to each other there is no chemistry the characters they portrait are only looking for their own careers stone doesnt play a talented actress nor does goslings character have a real feel for good jazz the script is bland there is no drama no fervor the main title song is good but the rest of the songs dont resonate also there are too few dancing scenes to call this a real musical stone is acting weak she shows more or less only one face expression this is not worth an oscar portman was much better as jackie im a fan of ryan gosling but he shouldnt have made this movie it will not help his image and his career the nomination for best actor was a joke he can do much better eg in the road beyond the pines,happy
this film is mercifully forgettable in fact i saw it just a couple of weeks ago and already almost all i remember is counting the ways i could have put my 11 quid to better use such as staying at home with a takeaway and rewatching chicago moulin rouge my fair lady or any other musical with actors who can actually sing and dance not to mention act lines which make you laugh songs worth listening to and characters not all of them bland yet obnoxious narcissists to be rigorously fair emma stones performance despite the dreadful script does push the production up a notch ie to notch one together with quite good technical features but the nauseous aftertaste you are left with as you walk  at last  out of the cinema is of the triumph of packaging over content that so many people apparently loved this film is flabbergasting has postmodernism finally broken free of its stuffy academic niche and convinced a generation that life is nothing more than a shallow pretence to be selfreferentially broadcast or could it be that few are willing to decry the absence of clothes on this appalling mediocrity of a film,happy
ive given 3 stars one star for each 10 million of the cost and also because i found this production as a musical third rate the colors sets and film shots were interestingeven imaginative but beyond that i was disappointed that this was the best hollywood could come up with in the musical genrethe script had abrupt transitions between scenes and time lapses the dance scenes by professionals were choppy and didnt show dance moves the story didnt get started until halfway through the two hoursthe scriptwriters took the easy way out toward the end by skipping over five years that i could imagine were more dramatic and emotional than the movie up to that point the viewer is cheated out of better story lines with no transition at all to bring the movie to its conclusion the last halfhour had more flair and drama than the rest of the moviestandards have been lowered and the younger generation must see oldies to get educated there was nothing exciting or inspirational in the dancing or the music as performed by amateur leads in all of this world are these the best musical leads that could be found you can find better singers pianists and dancers on tv competition shows or in community theater were these the best actors for the leads emma stone is charming as an actress but goslings profile was the only attractive attribute he has going he had no expression on his face for two hours other than sullen its very impressive that stars with no background in music and dance could take a crash course to prepare for this movie but the results were passable only if the director wanted to show how average people sing danceand play instruments he succeeded but the public deserves to see and appreciate the best musical talents around,happy
i think its a very boring movie i didnt like the chemistry between the actors and they were very poor individually as well full of clichs the movie shoudnt be nominated for so many categories there are so many other films that deserves to be recognized by the academy and by the other forums i hope they wont win the main categories the only thing i can say i like was the music period not recommend it,happy
the excitement that comes from news of a new movie in the pipeline in production or about to be released is palpable it has you searching for as much info as possible the cast line up can make you smile or say oooh interesting then the blue ribbon festivals announce the premiere of said new movie and you cant wait for the reviews the reactions youtube snippets of the stars being interviewed on the red carpet all in all you are a magnet to the hype and your own wishful thinking that the said movie is going to be greatcould not be classed as a great movie and just about sits on the fence for being a good movie was i disappointed given the leads were ryan gosling and emma stone who had a blistering chemistry in crazy stupid love and that the director was damien chazelle there was an instant snap crackle and pop to direct damien chazelles feature debut whiplash yet there is none of the snap crackle and pop to just as there was no chemistry or joie de vivre in watching ryan gosling and emma stonei am a fan of movies be they dramas comedies musicals etc there is no snobbery a great story grabs me and anchors me firmly to the seat and my romanticism endears me to the cast of a movie with a great story am i watching the same as many out there and not getting it  i think so part of me is dismayed that and all associated with it are sailing on the sea of hype where the conditions are just perfect one can also comment that the love for does have something to do with the current state of affairs here in the states and across the ocean in europe that said is a miss with much of the nonenglish speaking movie audiences where the artist was charismatic and a joy to watch misses the mark on so many levels just as we invest ourselves in the need for good news and feeling good by supporting our favourite sports teams similarly it is the same need that has the hype alive that need for being amazed being excited being wooed being contenti know there is no need for me to go into a synopsis of the story as the plot summary is there for all to read and plenty of people have had conversations about the film between themselves there is no doubting the sumptuous cinematography production design and art direction but thats about it when it comes to being worthy of so many nods and nominations chazelle fails to deliver in the writing and direction as the story drags and at many points whimpersas a romantic movie fails to deliver the cinematic honesty belief and likability in the characters of sebastian and mia especially when they connect maybe the movie needed input from the likes of writer nicholas sparks to give the romance and romantic leads much needed oomph the capacity of dialogue when sung to carry you away and invest yourself in the characters is never met by the singing of gosling and stone i dont think it has anything to do with the songs of the movie as they dont blow your socks off and neither do they have you humming or wanting to buy the cd when you leave the movie theatrethe movie is certainly a throw back to musicals of old where the likes of fred astaire cyd charisse gene kelly debbie reynolds sizzled on the screen with their dancing singing and songs lets not forget the wonderfully choreographed dance numbers of these classic musicals yes a lot of these musicals hired ghost singers to sing for the stars and it could have certainly helped the lackluster romance and musicality of does make it slow and you almost wish you had a remote to fast forward it is only the last five to ten minutes of the movie before end credits where the movies bitter sweet ending grabs your interest overall lacks the originality direction performances and gravitas of its musical predecessors,happy
i went to see this film feeling i had to after the rave critic reviews the 14 oscar nominations and the high imdb score i am not a great fan of musicals but remember grease etc for some great dancing and singing i went with my wife and 3 friends usually our perceptions and views on a film are quite varied in the case we were all in agreement that the film had nice scenery and photography and good acting from the two leads but overall was a very ordinary film of a sentimental love story the backdrop is the taken for granted opulence of the california wealthy where even an actress searching for work drives a new toyota prius probably hybrid and the lead male character apparently short of money gets a suit made to measure and somehow buys  a barnightclub in conclusion the film is over hyped overrated average romantic tosh dont waste your money on this but instead go see a much better film such as manchester by the sea this is my first written review which i felt compelled to give as imdbs average score and critics have got it so wrong,happy
lets set the parameters an oscarwinning film or any aboveaverage picture for that matter needs to fulfil criteria that sets it apart from the average it requires a breath of innovation storyline integrity and impeccable acting that levitates the subject above the norm it needs also to vault hype and financial remuneration to create a musical which i believe aspires in many parts to be there has to be a synergy between book score and choreography sadly for this viewer not one of these three elements can be considered by any stretch of the imaginationexceptional its triumph is evident in its cinematography and lighting which were largely outstanding but the remainder the story is typical hollywood fare  predictable without significant twists or intellectual excertion essentially nothing out of the ordinary happens and the blandness creeps to a predictable end the acting is ok you would expect as much from someone of goslings ability but i hope that one day hell be provided with a script that alienates him from the typecasting that befell hugh grant with a diversity that de nero was astute to select choreography what choreography that brief moment with the bench is all that taunts the memory singing  best not go there marni nixon could have played both rolesand i read today that its up for 14 academy nominations figures trump was successful so theres no reason this will not winemperors new clothes n all,happy
i liked it but thought it pretentious and all things american it was light on plot but i did like the chemistry between emma stone and lead guy i really would not take my friends to see it as it is too over the top great performances but not worth all the oscar buzz modern day musical and great screen sets where is the plot  i mean there is one but too thinly veiled to make it oscar nominations i saw lion now that film deserves the awards is a good title for it is mediocre and full of itself but not all bad i went on my own and think i enjoyed it because we aussies would be embarrassed to see this and have discussions on the deep and meaningful thoughts of this movie so go for it it either a like it or hate it,happy
the opening scene showed promise with an expansive dance scene but after that the film took a nose dive there were no memorable dance scenes apart from opening and closing sequences the dialogue story line were mundane i wanted to leave the cinema half way through but felt that my wife preferred me to stay though afterwards she agreed it lacked any good music or dance and was awfulif you have memorable memories of great musicals from the likes of west side story dont waste your money there were no memorable songs today i dont remember any which says something one song they flogged and played throughout in different ways but it wasnt a strong piece the lead characters failed to dance to any high degree of skill though it could be argued in their defence there was little opportunity for them to dance if you enjoy the musical genre and have memories of west side storythe king and i south pacific etc you will be so disappointed each one of those musicals has a list of memorable songs that stay with you years later this film had none the film will disappear into the ether and be forgotten hollywood hype and exposure has won over film quality,happy
this movie is awful the husband and i sat down to watch this highly acclaimed film for the evening and its dreadful we finally came to our senses and stopped about 45 minutes before the end when the smoke alarm goes off it lacks plot and substance it centers around brittle superficial characters who show no growth and talent could have been put to use better in another medium where their talents would have shined vs a pseudo musical the only explanation for the awards its received is that its a movie about hollywood being voted on by hollywood save yourself the time money and headache  avoid it,happy
if there is a category of best worst movies of all the time should be in top of it worst movie of all time dont waste your time to see it its mentally torture songs and instead of talking there is songs in it and it is not little bit of musical movie and lease dont compare it with whiplash and please i am begging to not watch anything else but not it,happy
surprised that people feel this is a fitting homage to great prior musicals much as i love ryan gosling and admire emma stone they do not hold a candle stub to great dancers and singers like fred astaire ginger rogers gene kelly cyd charisse judy garland john travoltaboth gosling and stone are adequate dancers okay but just not in the same class as the aforementioned and both have embarrassingly weak voicesyes sometimes their weaknesses border on the touching but give me ethel merman or bing crosby or ethel waters or hoagy carmichael and if you like touchingly amateur song delivery check out toni erdmannadd to their lack of musical talent and only adequate dancing the weak plot and the shallow characterizations and you might like the three people i saw it with emerge from the theater downcast and glum,happy
having seen sweep the golden globes and the oscar nomination announcements i had high hopes i believed all of the praise was deserving and from reading all of the summaries i was sure i would love this film however i was wrong while the cinematography was wonderful and the colors were incredible the story for me fell flat i felt like i was waiting forever to witness some kind of climax or even rising action i wish the film would have allowed the characters to display more depth and maybe i would have had the connection with them that i needed to have or at least found them some what appealing it missed out on having any logic or purpose for the characters actions and seemed inconsistent in exactly what it was trying to tell while i like emma stone and think she is a great actress i failed to recognize the chemistry between the two characters the musical numbers were cringe worthy although the score was fine ill give it that overall is visually pleasing but for me has overwhelming creative appeal with no substance to grasp any connection i wish i would have liked it disappointing,happy
one mediocre romanticmusical movie that does not worth watching i have even skipped some parts while watching it  first half was pretty boring while the second half was romantic clich some representative quotes are 1mia its pretty strange that we keep running into each other sebastian maybe it means something mia i doubt it sebastian yeah i didnt think so 2 sebastian what do you mean you dont like jazz mia it just means that when i listen to it i dont like it the only inspiring not really things in the movie are some of the songs played by sebastian and the bright outfits  mias yellow dress green and black dresses yellow bag yeah nice retro inspired outfits,happy
oh dear my head is still spinning from this filmnot because its good it is not but because of1 the overuse of panning shots in most of the production numbers the danged camera seemed to have attentiondeficitdisorder especially in that much ballyhooed andtotally preposterous opening number set during a typical la traffic jam perhaps it was the use of cinemascope hello 1960s that made the constant camera movement so difficult to watch2 the totally banal how many times have we seen this plot combining two themes so longintooth that the scriptwriters should have named the characters boy and girl for the plot is nothing more than boymeetsgirl girl at first cares little for boy girl slowly falls for boy girl and boy become a couple eventually boyandgirl uncouple boy and girl move on3 the other timeworn theme is how hard it is for ayas attractive young aspirants to make it in heartless hollywood as in fill in your fave movie titles here4 the fact that this film runs 128 minutes add that time to the 20 minutes of prefeature trailers and i might have fallen asleep especially during the griffith observatory dance sequence except for the fact that my bladder kept asking isnt there a bathroom around here 5 one sortofpositive note the film reconfirmed my longheld from personal experience belief that la has one of the most boringlybanal streetscapes block after block of lowerthanlowrise commercial buildings in the usthe only thing more tedious than la is this film set in that awful place,happy
has been receiving dozens of accolades about its look its stars its love of musicals and its ability to transport us to a world long gone from the american movies damien chazelle exploded in the movie scene with whiplash a movie that burst with emotions music and strong performances in fact music was a living character a force that captured the protagonists souls and bewitched the audience it seemed only natural that chazelle would try a more ambitious project a fullfledged musical inspired by the golden age of musical and that somehow would keep his feet on the groundemma stone and ryan gosling play a couple of dreamers who fall in love in the city of dashed dreams by the time they meet she has been to too many auditions which led nowhere hes a lover of jazz a form of music that doesnt really appeal to the masses but it is his obsession and he doesnt appear to be the compromising type he finds himself often and he chooses to ignore practicality over dreams maybe thats what attracts him to the aspiring actress or maybe its the fact that she is a looker and a charmer with a dash of innocencethe film has them going to parties full of vapid personalities and possible contacts these parties are at best hollow expendable and also serve as backdrop or props for the next musical number there were times when i wondered how these two characters managed to even become guests in those settings there are many holes in this musical and too many instances where one feels like the team is trying too hard to show creativity he drives an old loud and hip convertible she somehow can afford a prius with what appears to be a part time job as a barista in check this a movie studiomusicals are about dreams and dont stress reality and accuracy over dreams and the magic of its music and sets but even singing in the rain didnt hold back in its portrayal of the negative in hollywood it didnt hold back when showing the prototypes in the parties and at best you were part of the help if you ever made into a party we have seen spontaneous and magical musical numbers take over reality in many films the ones in here fall short in many waysmuch has been said about the freeway opening number and i wanted to like it a lot but there was no fire in the performances the dancing or the quite boring setting there wasnt any particular challenges in the dancing and the lyrics felt amateurish at best it wasnt a good beginning for a musical because it didnt even hint at better things to comeimproves as it goes on but the quality of the lyrics remains a problem the melodies in the smaller numbers fare better almost approaching lovely a couple of times and since its a fantastic with touches of realism its pretty sad the only time i felt like i was really witnessing magic was the bit in the observatory conveniently opened after closing hours and when were given the alternate take on what their lives could have beenemma is lovely and ryan does a good job portraying the jazz piano player romance and chemistry register and there are moments that show the director and writer understands the world of entertainment but it also reveals that theres a limit to what he knows it pains me to compare it singing in the rain but that other movie had its heart and mind in the right place an exuberant song and dance piece that had insights on what lied in the heart of the beast showing the duplicity in the hearts of some of the members of this world dreams came across loud and clear in vibrant colors the hunger to belong and be more successful was apparent in the physical routines fame which portrayed the world of the aspiring singers and dancers bursts with physical force in all of its numbers it never needs to call attention to itselfmaybe the problem is that for a musical about making it and trying to keep dreams and love alive in the city of dreams it does not offer much in the way of magical settings the brush around the observatory is not pretty especially the first time we see them dancing there are hints of greatness but they come too far in betweenmaybe we want to like it too much but lets be honest it scores big in effort it doesnt do too well with the finished project i kept having flashes of the artist fame singing in the rain films that delivered in quality both lyrically and visually i wasnt angry just disappointed because i wanted to like it more maybe a bit more time rehearsing getting a better lyricist focusing more etc could have made its heart beat with a stronger more interesting form of energy,happy
ye gods this was bad i notice only now imdb does not offer 0 as a possible raring so i guess i gotta go for 1 so be it my skin is getting covered with red spot just thinking that the academy is ready to pour plenty of awards on what i think is the most idiotic movie of the year and possibly beyond the world is sinking the titanics orchestra is always ready sing a song evil will go away why awarding movies that hurt that make you feel uncomfortable i know i know what youre going to tell me right because we are surrounded by problems we need to dream yeah wellexcept that theres a difference between dreaming and going numb between lightening up and unplugging your brain so at least youre warned but if you still like the titanics orchestra here it goes the silliest blend of dejavus and clichs the starving artist giving up the bucks for his dreams the starving artist giving up the dreams for the bucks the evil starsystem in hateful hollywood etc etc delivered through a dead and buried genre the musical yeah,happy
from the raves and reviews that my partner and i had read and heard we were expecting an academy award winning quality movie to rival the classics of all times is not it is not a movie to rival any great musical or comedy film the movie is of a basic boy meets girl storyline with a weak plot to follow it is in no way in the same league as a west side story 1961 motion picture i can see how it may be entertaining to the age group of 18 to 40 year oldmaybe but for those of us who know classic musical movies and plays it is quickly realized that this movie is not to be a classic entertaining in parts but not memorable some of the scenery of la and surrounding area was well shot but much of the cinematography was fast moving and narrowly focused like the movies plot this writers movie guest of the evening developed motion sickness from the jumpy and outoffocus scenetoscene action of the cameras no idea how this movie can be considered memorable for shortterm memory enjoyment or longterm entertainment reflections much less how can it be considered academy award worthy,happy
special opening comment for idmbcom honestly i just wanted to leave my thoughts on the film itself but then i saw the overwhelming amount of positive reviews on this film and praising it like there is no tomorrow love letter to hollywood really in what way is a love letter all it does is refer to some classics and then completely botches up the elements that makes us love the classics in the first place if anything this is making a mockery out of everyone involved in those high quality old school musicals that were made with love and passion is made out of greed you better remember thisnow i have this out of my system my original review which you can read on my website chrichtons worldis a tribute to the old school musicals where actors like fred astaire gene kelly debbie reynolds and many others impressed us with their acting singing and dancing they were top notch in whatever they did on the screen and truly were stars all around however is not a particularly good tribute as it lacks a lot that made films like singin in the rain and an american in paris classicsso what went wrong first and foremost the musical numbers are far from memorable when i first heard the song city of stars i liked it instantly it easily is the best song but at the same time a very flawed one why ryan gosling is not a good singer i am sure he tried his best but you can hear that he cant sing that well in another version of the song emma stone chimes in and i dont like that version at all because she is even a worse singer than he is both also cant dance and its so bad that it was ruining the enjoyment you can tell that they are struggling and their movements were far too slow in the opening musical number you have a bunch of unknown people singing and dancing and they obviously know what they are doing as they move very swiftly and gracefully they also do a lot of impressive stunt work very reminiscent of what was shown in the older musicals and while this scene was good it exposed the flaws of ryan gosling and emma stone as leads especially in the first dance scene featuring emma stone it becomes painfully obvious she is not a match for anyone in the opening sceneanother huge problem is the story or lack of nothing in the story was remotely interesting and pretty by the numbers and the one supposed conflict was so predictable and forced that destroyed all the hope that was left what hope for this film to redeem itself and it never does instead it gives us an ending opposite of what is expected since director damien chazelle is pretentious and very full of himself i guess the fame and success he achieved with whiplash has gotten to his head and whiplash wasnt that good in the first place and no i dont need predictable endings what i do need are endings that are logical and are written well it has to make sense why characters behave and act a certain way you have to give the viewer reasons to make their actions believable chazelle never even attempts this he only gives a motivation out of convenience also i am failing to see how anything in this film could be seen as comedic there maybe were one or two moments that were genuinely funny but enough for this film to be advertised as a comedy not in the slightestalso just referring to the classics is not enough you need to add something of your own to make it unique or entertaining i mean these songs were the best they could do at points they showed la in the background and it looked like more was going to be done with the scenery like michael mann did in heat i think more beautiful shots of la at night would have surely made some impact but of course that would have required real efforti dont feel like writing anymore truth be told i was very looking forward to this film since i really was in the mood for some old school fun and all i got in return is anger and disappointment since this film is nothing like the classicsi do think i have been very fair as this film is advertised as one of the greatest musicals  films in a long time and this simply is not true even with all the good will this film has no redeeming elements whatsoever,happy
i have no clue what all the fuss is about i think it is hollywood in love with itself all these awards nominations is about as realistic as trumps 3 million illegal votersthe dance scenes are terrible they have obviously learned a few moves for the movie but isnt much better than the contestants on dancing with the stars they wouldnt even have made it as supporting dancers for fred and ginger the singing is slightly better but not muchthe story line is trite and obvious i regretted spending the money to see it in a theater when my wife and i came out we looked at each other and said why did people make such a big deal about this moviei will say the cinematography was excellent but that wasnt enough to save the movie,happy
im a movie buff and ive seen seven movies this year and i love musicals however for the first time ever i walked out half way through a movie as did my friend and half the audience was the slowest most boring movie i have ever seen i cannot believe that emma stone got an academy award for best actress it was a shocker the story would have been best left as a nicelytold romance instead his effort at playingmiming jazz piano was abysmal their attempt at the fredandginger dancing would have been knocked out in the first round of dancing with the stars emmas upthenostril close ups and very very limited singing ability were not attractive but above all the songwriting repetitive uninspiring motifs and transparent unimaginative scoring was the biggest disappointment at last there was an opportunity for an original composed and scored movie musical and they came up with this drivel i apologise to those who enjoyed it im sure there was merit if you werent distracted by a critical eye,happy
ok a musical where neither actor can sing or dance that is not a good idea to say the least i find emma stone to be annoying and a terrible actress she is monotone i must be the only person that doesnt like her but i think she is terrible i didnt like either of the self absorbed self pitying characters i didnt care what happened to them the dialog is thin it could have been written by a child the music is uninteresting i did like the one song john legend didneed i say more i find it sad that movie goers today are finding this piece of trite amazing dont waste your money,happy
too long no plot boring music and overall flat cheesy and superficial highly overrated,happy
there are many musicals that fall into my favorites category and this is definitely one of them for a director to take two actors that have no singing or dancing experience however a dynamic chemistry with each other made it work the opening scene immediately draws the audience in with a snappy amazing musical number on an la freeway this number was worth the theater tickets as the storyline develops in the lives of these two people both struggling artists in different industries we are pulling for them both to find success and an enduring relationship if you havent seen this yet what are you waiting for go and enjoy you will laugh and cry which definitely makes up a good movie right weve seen it at least five times and will probably again we grew up on musicals,happy
its amazing the variety of thoughts that you can see in this film reviews ive met people that loved every single second of the movie and ive met people that hated it in my opinion is a masterpiece if you love musicals and romances this is definitely your choice,happy
flash reviewa colorful and poetically told story about two people who must choose between their dreams or their relationship was their romance truly meant to be or will fate intervene the two romantics are scraping by and trying to make it in music and on the acting scene will various life hurdles throw them off track gosling and stone melt into their characters with honest dialog and compliment by emotions revealed through expressions it had some peppy musical moments vivid scenes colorful costumes and had a warm spirit about it additionally there were a few nice touching moments as well as several creatively dreamy and whimsical scenes overall it was a simply story laced with a spectrum of emotions,happy
i saw this on 2018 on february just before the oscarfound this movie real good very good pictureit is indeed a fantasy film with real good dancing scenes i happen to play the piano so the jazz parts were a candy to people who like watching jazz mia is adorable her struggle in hollywood seems convincingi think this film makes you either hate the industry or inspire youits a long movie over two hours but they spread it over four seasons to make it reasonable in conclusion i never watched something like this before 34thimaginary yet real good screenplay,happy
from the internationally proclaimed musical director from whiplash damian chazelle has come back strong with another musical film lala landstorming 5 academy awards and 6 golden globes has proven how successful the movie is besides it gains itthe movie starts with the song another day of sun with a group of people dancing in highway the choreography itself is remarkable enough but the real magic lies in the tracking shot throughout the whole song without any editing the cinematography by linus sandgren has not only stops at the tracking shot but the use of natural lighting throughout the whole movie the colour grading and the camera movement has created a tremendous nerves of visual sensation each songs blends into the music perfectly with the camera following the choreography showing each dancing movement clearly this doesnt stop the cinematic magic of damien chazzele he himself is a musician he knows the music well enough that he understand how music may engage the audience deep enough to make an impact he finds pasek and paul to be the composer of the music soundtrack the soundtrack won the academy award forest original soundtrack after watching the movie the songs and lyrics keeps popping out in my head brainwashing this is how the cinematic magic works words cant describe how appealing the movie is some may say the plot is too realistic and the whole movie is overrated but these opinions comes to be objective maybe the plot may not suites anyones taste but you cant deny the fact that this movie somehow brings a impact to people letting people feeling nostalgic back to the 60s where it claimed to be the golden age of hollywood after adapting ideas from singing in the rain the umbrellas of cherbourg and revel without a cause the usage of costume and colour somehow comprehend a special visual experience making the movie colourful and strong in sensethe special chemistry between ryan gosling and emma stone also reminds us of the reality nowadays making us feeling someway desperate of the truth where people are unable to follow their dreams but to sacrifices lots in order to achieve our goalemma stone has done a brilliant job of portraying the role of mia maybe she cant sing but the acts and emotion of hers is undeniably relatable while ryan gosling acting as the role of sebastian frankly is a bit too ordinary damien chazzele may be the new generation of musical director bringing new era of musical film to hollywood back in the 50s and 60s when musical film are a hit the hype ends in the 70s nowadays less and less musical films are made in hope of damien chazzele wishing he may bring back the hype of musical film back to hollywood,happy
this tale about love to find your own way its an engaging and precious love story without excessive pastry dont care the people who thinks the musical movies are extremely cloyingthe incredible performance of ryan gosling and the outstanding emma stone is symbiotic simply terrifici can not get rid of this soundtrack its like the perfume you throw in the morning this movie remind you how difficult is conciliate your couple life with a success life in your job thats the subtext of this story and many other unfortunately for the heart fortunately for their careers that is a debate that will always be open,happy
this flat poorly scripted movie clearly draws from read copied west side story singing in the rain funny face the balloons moulin rouge top hat and actually succeeds in failing we even hear kermit the frogs rainbow connection in emmas song about her auntwhen the screen said five years later i sighed with relief thank god i did not have to sit for five years in front of this disaster i can write a better script than that many can and with all those movies the writerdirector copied from he should have delivered a product that was at least watchable not an oscar contender at all dont waste your time or your money,happy
im not a fan of musicals obviously there are exceptions such as singing in the rain the wizard of oz and more recently the great sing street not the regular american musical where people seem to feel an uncontrollable urge to sing and dance in the middle of the street for no reason at all however even going against all my instincts and because of all the fuzz i decided to watch i arrived i sat down i settled down i waited the movie begins suddenly people singing reproducing a choreography perfectly rehearsed almost mechanical an explosion of colors as if the world was painted in technicolor in a long take   practically perfect i could no longer stay put every position was already bothering me after 3 minutesthen we have the first glimpses of emma stone and ryan gosling a bad start how shocking at first we are introduced to mia stone and later we become familiar with seb gosling in a third moment we finally have the two together and from there inseparable but not so much and here i must say the fact that emma stone and ryan gosling are extremely charismatic helped me a lot so i would not go into a catatonic mode and stop paying attention to the screening unfolding in front of me but not even the enormous charisma of the two was enough to make me enjoyi like emma stone shes a good actress she does not have much depth lets face it but she manages to do her job in a decent way i think birdman was her less emma stone moment of all because i could see a little beyond the wide eyes and the halfopen mouth her trademarks well neither emma nor ryan are singers much less dancers however it seems that all the reviews minimize these details especially due to the forced exuberance the director displays throughout the film and the chemistry between the protagonists the harsh reality is that stone is no debbie reynolds let alone gosling a gene kelly i could not minimize it it was strange it was uncomfortablethe whole experience was uncomfortable chazelle is a good director who has impressive technical skills but for me he tried to take a step way longer than his legs perhaps he was overconfident because of what he achieved with whiplash i dont know all i know is that it lacked humbleness is pretentious and at the same time ordinary it hides behind the right light and a good art directionalthough the film is divided by seasons it gets a little tricky to realize this when its set is los angeles apart from the captions on the screen indicating that we have passed from spring to summer and so on nothing else alludes to what seems to be something important for the narrative neither the set nor the cinematography so be it summer or fall all that hovers is the love between mia and seb in gaudy colorsnot that the cinematography itself is bad quite the opposite its too beautiful as i said the lighting is right almost perfect do you see the problem when i watch a movie photographed by lubezki for example i do not need to be constantly reminded by light tricks that he is a master of cinematography but linus sandgren is not a lubezki it is not innovative it is not exceptional and this leads us to the script girl meets boy girl falls in love with boy girl and boy live unforgettable moments problems happen i have to admit that here chazelle even tried to skip the usual and lived happily ever after but it backfired im not going to tell what happens at the end cause it would be unfair to those who have not yet watched it it is enough to say that even if he wanted to do something different it was nothing that we had never seen before as if it was not enough he decided to teach us about dreams expectations determination and reality not necessary too unnecessaryi do not doubt that many people really liked it was made to be liked i just do not understand how more experienced eyes have been fooled giving a masterpiece status to such an ordinary movie the directing is almost convincing there are some interesting metaphors jazz  hollywood  golden age even so is miles behind the great musicals ever made its beneath its fuzz and beneath the expectations of someone who wanted from the bottom of the heart to have liked this film myself,happy
the plotmia an aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and sebastian a jazz musician scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them aparthands down this garbage was the worst movie i have seen in a decade from the first frame to the last i was bored to hellwhywell first off the musical numbers actually suck a big one they are unoriginal and silly and not entertaining the music is a borethe story is so thin you can slide it in a locked freezer doordont believe the hype hollywood lost its ability to make good musicals decades ago and this one is the bottom of the barrel,happy
i saw this film with my mum who wanted a day out to watch a nice film shes very into titles like dirty dancing greece and the sound of music which she read reviews and with all its critical acclaim which are totally erroneous wanted to see the film when we came out of the cinema however we both looked at each other then i asked well what did you think my mum merely replied that was awful the plot of the film was simplistic and to be honest non existent there was no chemistry between the characters emma stone and ryan gosling and the film didnt really grasp any genre it wasnt a musical which it seemed like it with two long sections at the start but didnt really wow you or tell a story the film also seemed to forget about dancing or singing halfway through when there was hardly any this was apart from the films same song which is repeated so many times it became loathsome the was as well only really two characters in the whole film two leads can make or break a film in this there was nothing really that made that characters memorable or interesting in this convoluted story the film also lasted far too long with a bizarre ending which didnt particularly make sense i do think this film was totally overrated by critics this is not a film which anyone should waste their time seeing which anyone should see,happy
its hard to understand how this lifeless musical has done so well at the box office and swept up so many awards and nominations the film goes downhill fast after an impressive opening songanddance routine on a gridlocked interstate overpass as soon as the traffic starts rolling again this love story between a jazz pianist and wannabe actress gets underway with a prescient gesture thanks to interruptions for some undistinguished musical numbers it takes them almost an hour and several coincidental meetings before theyre sufficiently motivated to kickstart their tepid romance unfortunately there doesnt seem to be much glue holding them together and they soon have an unconvincing argument about chasing their respective dreams this leads to a brief breakup followed by a halfhearted reconciliation later its revealed they parted  presumably because they werent all that into each other in the first place  but the script doesnt bother to show how this separation occurred as the narrative approaches its conclusion las infamous traffic congestion facilitates yet another meeting and a final chance to ignite some drama the biggest mystery is why so many critics and viewers admire this drab love affair between two people who seem unable to communicate either affection or passion,happy
there have been many many really great movies over the decades this includes all categories from action and adventure to romance comedy and musicals etc for many years my wife and i have used the review rating system here on imdb to help us make an informed decision about what movies to see and which ones to avoid the last two movies including had ridiculously high ratings ratings that exceed some of the greatest movies of all timewhile we didnt hate it certainly doesnt merit a score of 89 im a romantic at heart so i didnt walk out of the theater and i endured the slow parts in the end i was okay with the film but walked away disappointed because it didnt deliver on what i expect from such a overall highly rated review recently a famous retail online website named after a famous rain forest in south america started filing lawsuits for a recent flood of false  fake and misleading reviews that make the product appear better than it is i cant help but wonder if the same problem ie hacks is now infiltrating imdb i certainly hope notnet if you like musicals just reset your level of expectations to average dont expect to see anything great my time in the theater was pleasant and relaxing i enjoyed the popcorn and the quiet time with my wife but we both agreed it failed to live up to the high ratings found here on imdb,happy
another masturbatory exercise in hollywood self gratification like birdman that presupposes that los angeles is the only city on earth that matters and that actors are all anyone should aspire to be another piece of irrelevant nonsense that will sweep awards and be forgotten like the artist a film like silence which addresses the true suffering of the human condition gets passed over thanks to hollywood christophobia and instead we are asked to lavish praise on another piece of fluff about struggling artists disposable and forgettable effluent,happy
it was absolutely pathetic bunch of prozacdrugged hippies dancing to anything this sets absolutely unrealistic life expectations for young people and you should be ashamed of allowing this abysmal piece of schnitzel to be made public overlyhyped hollywood piece of garbage that didnt need to exist i would prefer to watch donald trumps inauguration speech on repeat for 72hours straight than watching that opening scene againi have left the cinema in 20 minutes and decided i had to log back into my imdb account just to try to help other people before they get scammed by hollywood marketing stuntsryan gosling cant sing for schnitzel how did you manage to convince gosling to sign up for it and ruin his life,happy
i saw a trailer for this and was pumped for it i love jazz i love modern jive i love dance i love theatre but for me it fails miserably after watching trailer i was expecting something along the lines of grease mama mia or a good old fashioned singing in the rain type affair if you are an arty farty type person it may be your thing it was long there was a lot of material that just felt like filler it felt disjointed there was nothing memorable about it most of the time we were wondering where it was going the ending was abrupt it was clever but after such a long film i felt this bit was neglected it felt rushed i love the actors but this one is easily forgotten wont be watching this again disappointed,happy
how can anyone claim this film is so compelling neither ryan gosling nor emma stone can sing or dance and this is a socalled musical and when either tries to sing its painful to watch them struggle with every note emma stone talks through her teeth to obscure her lisp which is just too annoying to ignore to put this film in the same league as west side story and the sound of music is laughable its a movie which cant decide exactly what it is so were given alternate endings so that you can just take your pick of which one you prefer a manipulative gesture that demonstrates no confidence in the writing which is totally lackluster and its way too long dont bother,happy
is one of the most overrated movies ive seen in many years how it won so many golden globe awards and is nominated for so many oscars is beyond me a tissue thin tinsel town story attempting to pass itself off as a musical not a single memorable song with a nice theme of half a dozen chords a few bars even repeated almost ad nauseum and not a suitable vehicle for the actors perhaps it would have been better if the singing had been dubbed by professional singers sheer selfindulgence by and for hollywood narcissists with nothing to redeem it not even its nod to past real musicals,happy
overrated hype not worth the cinema ticket confused plot that didnt seem to be sincere but not a comedy ryan cant singit was dreadful and pitiful miscast and disappointing not sure he can dance just a series of poses for the camera no real acting ability or belief in the character reallyit is a crock of st nothing memorable about the soundtrack other than some of the jazz the opening sequences were pointless to the film couldnt work out what they were singing about as the playback was of a poor quality this format should be left in the past  forgotten about dont waste your money my companion fell asleep during the film it was that boring glad when it was over as musicals go this was hopeless when you compare to other modern productions such as bugsy malone grease chicago this does not standup to scrutiny a case of emperors new clothes awful,happy
i love musicals all the old fred astaire and gene kelly movies all the rogers and hammerstein those wonderful cole porter songs the thrilling choreography exciting ensemble performances foot tapping and humming as we left the cinema or theatre after watching cats les miserables mama mia or matilda this film was nothing like them the music was unoriginal elevator music the choreography was lame the plot was banal the lead actors worked very hard but despite their obvious beauty and skills even they couldnt save it sorry it should have been animated and targeted for the preteens it was an insult to our intelligence i cant think who could have loved this film no one i know liked it we worked hard analyzing it trying to give it credit  anything  but it was a struggle sweet was suggested second half was much better was another comment we really wanted to like it,happy
is a strange movie there ive said itit seems to leave the viewer with a somewhat split attitude and will leave you pondering long after youve seen itits been a long time since ive seen a movie which has inspired me to write any sort of feedback but has done just that depending on which review you read on imdb youll either find a 1010 which tells you that it is a musical masterpiece hankering back to the old cinematic masterpieces of kelly astaire and co or youll read a 110 which criticises each and every little detail of the movielets be honest neither review is of helpis a good movie it has some great tunes and for large parts leaves you inspired theres no denying youll come out of it feeling a bit of an urge to jump on top of the nearest car and dancehowever it is not the masterpiece that is so widely reportedthere are times when both gosling and stone characters are infuriating mildly pretentious and really rather whinny neither actor is perfectly cast but simultaneously it is impossible not to be impressed by the fact that theyve obviously trained hard at singing dancing and for gosling the pianoits a strange film it really isi want to love it i want to come out singing the praises and looking back at it with the fondness of old school movies or even the more recent artist however i cant something feels wrong about it the cinematography is a bit off the tunes dont always catch you the storyline isnt always clear it almost feels like the film tries too hard to be good it knows there is potential but it tries to force this ability and subsequently lets itself downi enjoyed the jazz and there are scenes i look back on fondly i want to watch it a second time to give myself a greater understanding of it but simultaneously ive not come out of the cinema and thought i need to see that again this is a bad signyoull read a lot of praise for this film youll read a lot of criticism youll also read reviews a lot more detailed and knowledgeable than this one i guess what im saying is that the film is not as good or as bad as anyone saysits a film you should see youll need to make your mind up does it deserve the oscars personally i dont think so will it win them probablygive it a go but go in with an open mind the critics cant help you with this one,happy
the opening of this movie set it up perfectly amateurish and boring i actually fell asleep during part   sorry i found no depth in the characters emma had good points during her auditions that showed her acting capacity ryan gosling is great to look at but i think came across too subdued and cardboardlike the singing was boring but i think some was filmed live which is refreshingthe ending was the best part with an alternate possibility plus thankfully it was also the end of the movie a lot of hype over im not quite sure what,happy
bollywood is the nickname of the indian film industry largely centered in bombay now called mumbai it produces a steady stream of pisikaka every year so much so that it is in guiness book of world records in some category most of bollywood films are in that sense musicals because it has a lit of music and dance and they are absurd the song and dance sequence but cleverly donewith that out of the way i think the reader can figure out why i chose the above heading if you have seen the movie not sure why are you reading it although i read reviews after i seen a movie to just check out what other people think and if you have not i would suggest you do go watch it i have been meaning to ever since it came out and been postponing it because i wanted to be sufficiently depressed so that if the movie sucked which it kinda did on many levels then my day could not get any worse and it did notit is a strange movie almost like seinfeld a tv show about nothing although there is the loose connection with ones dreams how dreams are almost difficult to pursue blablahblah and of course ends with the hackneyed clich where boy meets girl boy and girl fall in love boy and girl go separate ways and boy and girl meets 5 years later to think what could have been boring so bollywoodemma stone is not even pretty but she grows on you and looks cute in the middle gosling is in equal parts good looking good actor and does a decent job neither his performance nor emma stones  or for that movie as a whole is nothing to write home about so aptly if i may use a symbolism summarized in emma stones mias phone call to her mother describing sebastian her new boyfriend he is not anyone yet there are hardly any other characters of any significance in the movie the guy who plays kevin or keith besides perpetuating the clich white boys cant jump you have to have black people if you are talking jazz do not see what was his role in the movie i hear he is some kind of a musician of some fame my advice would be not that he needs it or cares that do not give up your day job talk about product placementacting is ordinary sets are great and that dance sequence with the canary yellow dress which is plastered all over the promo material is really good besides that not much why it is so much of a craze i would not know why 14 nominations who knows i dont get to nominate and frankly who cares besides the folks who made the movie it does not deserve the hate did not even know it had hate till i stumbled along the boards nor does it deserve 14 oscar nomination or 7 golden globes surpassing one flew over cuckoos nest seriously my wife watched the movie with her girlfriends on release day and described it as magical i knew then i better not rush to watch it it is a chickflick but with a sub text the queen of unrequited love is the man how bollywood a solid 6,happy
the music was enjoyable but not memorable the professional dancers were were excellent the leads  ok gosling  stone did a good job as far as acting but singing  dance are not their talent  at least in this movie the story line was pretty routine nothing all that dramatic i had a hard time keeping awake for most of it the ending helped redeem it but not enough to give it more than 5 stars  for me at least the dialog was a trite i still remember many of the songs from the old musicals i dont think i will remember much of anything from this if you are looking for a nice evening with a simple  sappy story line and pleasant music you wont be disappointed just dont go in with high expectations if you disagree and love it great you will be pleasantly surprised,happy
first off i have to admit i am not a musical fan so that definitely is a factor i was told however this would appeal to everyone even the ones who do not usually enjoy musicalsthe opening of the movie already had me fearing the worst it is cheesy not very well sung and it carried on forever oh well here come the main characters i found them to be shallow and extremely annoying singing definitely is not their best quality the dancing not of this erathe story is so superficial and hollywood self indulgent half way through i had no choice but to walk out i do not understand this movie has been received so well there are other movies which are much more deserving of various awards this was a huge disappointment,happy
a massacre this is bad this is really bad i really havent seen a movie that bad and god there are number of them every year in a long time and so outrageously awarded every possible clich is present the trafficjam encounter seen that in for the love of the game the people dancing on top of the cars singing about burritos ive seen it already the start of the relationship in front of a movie seen it a hundred times already its like two people collide into each other on the side walk or at the park and they fall in love its funny because just a year ago woody allen did a musical and is a clear copycat and the ending is predictable by a mile and they met again at this bar and he played the song and they wondered if whatever had been different please this is overdone  its hard to believe that the hype the campaign the distribution of awards the columnists who are bought out is actually real the whole modern day musical and an incredible bet  is a jokethis is not a musical this is a caricature of high school musical its on the same level as any other sitcom out there but has any of these members of the jury of the golden globes and academy awards ever watched the sound of music  want to hear an actual musical performer  julie andrews not emma stone julie andrewsryan gossling  im sorry but i just dont understand what was going through the director of castings mind when i think of male performers yeah astaire paul robson but what is gossling doing in a musical i thought a musical was supposed to be a movie with an actual score and performers  chazelles lone motivation building a famous couple he wants the girl hes the most attracted to thats what this movie is all about its to propel gosslingstone duo right up there with bettydunaway andrewsvan dyke costnersarandon and say i created an iconic couple no you didnt this is a lazy script that doesnt give homage whatsoever to the great musicals its romance is as insipid as the romance in creed and cheesy as in my all american who does chazelle think he is to believe that he is the first to draw four girls in a red yellow green blue skirts  the camera work is terrible it loops it takes detours  it wants to be creative but there is no discipline to it and thats why it looks bad the fundamentals were not respected to be honest you feel like screaming throughout the entire moviei remember when moulin rouge came out i was unimpressed by the lack of depth and flavor of the characters but the montage in the format of a videoclip was quite entertaining this however does not back up the hype,happy
im giving this film a three for the opening scene the rest was room temperature unsalted oatmeal i tried to like ryan and emmas characters but they were empty vessels partly due to bad writing and partly due to their lack of commitment to the roles ryan looked like he was about to soil his undies at any moment whether because he was righteously defending his bachelorhood or jazz  his go to expression appeared to be constipated emma whose face looked oddly proportioned in tight closeups was a wisp of a character ungrounded and therefore unbelievable the aspirational lecturing about jazz and watching rebel without a cause came across as pedantic overall it all felt tepid and safe and softshoe ie no passion i was bored and felt time weigh heavily on this film the music was bland as well dreamy goopy overlysweet generic and also boring i cant say i would ever be inclined to recommend this film to anyone for any reason it just never got going i actually cant believe it won as many awards at the golden globes as it did now i understand why ryan had such a look of surprise  or was it constipation who cares,happy
i went into this expecting a really fun movie and ended up alternating between watching it and reading a short story and i finished most of the story it had great potential but even allowing for the fantasy during the musical numbers which i personally enjoyed it simply wasnt developed well enough and the plot had a lot of holes if people dont like jazz these days how is he going to get them to come to a jazz club no matter how pure the music is or especially if it is rarified do people really show up at auditions with so little attention to their appearance if she doesnt like jazz why is she so struck by his jazz musicthe worst problem is that the singers all have weak voices which detracts tremendously from the songs i didnt find the music memorable but i enjoyed it at the time the stars arent great dancers either i never came to care very much about them they didnt have a lot of chemistry and were only intermittently likablei would have liked most of the musical scenes except for the amateurish singing and dancing i dont see a lot of movies so i generally didnt get references if that is what the people who liked the movie were charmed by the romantic and professional angst scenes were too long and too many isnt it ok if gosling sells out his music until he can earn enough for his club how else does he expect to get the money if his preferred art form is dying that was when i started reading on my iphone the ringer was turned off i thought that the final scene was very well done although it didnt tie into what went before too well it doesnt really connect to the decision point that preceded iti see by the reviews that some people hated what i loved and vice versa so good luck deciding whether or not to see it,happy
this film didnt fool me for a minute i felt like i was watching a tourist promo spot traffic stanley donens street dancing even skaters that projected how clich hollywood falls when it no longer can teach the world how to live think decades ago through movies americans saw the world through a peephole and now it revives it with cinemascope and predictable dialogues banking this time on the simplicity of selling the dream paradigm the unsung jazz pianist struggling to be reckoned with an aspiring actress working as a barista beating the audition circuit they used to fill in as waitresses or party musiciansworking in obscurity yet still in awe revering showbiz and stardom as their lives goal not much has changed from the day when studios used to capitalize on similar scripts selling glitzy but deluding rags to riches stories this movie was much needed to the hollywood crowd hence all those overrated accolades and much hype this film was promoted and marketed to add on the collective autosuggestion and make them feel that showbiz is the ultimate quest of them all its an ego booster to feed the masses that they should keep dreaming quit school college or other utilitarian goals and move to hollywood land to pursue an infinitesimal share of the vast wealth of the industry which equates to a mere 1 of what the movie distributors and production companies rake in selling movie tickets and later dvd sales however i didnt have to go to the movies and contribute to that 1 to get the gist of it i streamed the film and ffw through the musical parts to skip the commercial overload in the hopes that i could extract net dramatic quality performances were superb but the scriptstory failed us all i hope members of the academy and sagnonsag actors can see how detached the film was to the real life of a struggling performer who will never taste notoriety or come even close to make it big in this town a salutary warning to those who still dream big and must face the sad reality that 995 of their guild are still waiting for that call back or a friend of a friend to pull them up on the main stage trying to depart from the original mission of enlightening the way to an already preconvinced sold audience the producers cant hide behind the telling the story excuse instead they should admit they were just selling us the 6th st bridge hollywood aint paved with gold,happy
how can a film be so tiring is it its duration or the immaturity and naiveness that covers all of its existence i am afraid it is the latter simply because there have been numerous films throughout the history of cinema of such duration and longer that have not carried all those negative characteristics like this film doesby trying so much to recreate an era a romantic era that existed only in films so many decades ago and place it in our era what they have managed to do is fill a two hour film with clich and silly unconnected scenes that even for someone who goes to the movies for the first time will be easily seen without much thought or effort so much dancing and fake sentiment and so much sunshine music and singing that allow me to say it is an offence to the real deal true musicals that will always be remembered and will never be created again that for a future referenceoverestimated unworthy of such plethora of awards and nominations absolutely i simply an open minded person wanted to see what was all that fuss all the enthusiasm applauding and high ranking instead i was rewarded witha yawn and just a tiny bit of frustration,happy
mandatory fun were the first words i scribbled in my notebook after sitting through damien chazelles oppressively whimsical throwback this years the artist is another hollow exercise striving to be a simulacrum of a thing while pretty much missing the whole point of what its trying to replicate yet much like michel hazanavicius instantly forgotten 2011 oscar darling 2016s presumptive best picture winner has inspired a bizarrely defensive cult of otherwise intelligent levelheaded people blathering uncritically about movie magic while hurling personal attacks at we bitter folks who dare not adore their beloved confection in the weeks since being underwhelmed by ive been told i have no heart no love for film and that i must be unable to experience joy so basically its a superhero movie for middlebrowsthe strain shows from the opening number in which commuters stuck in gridlock on the los angeles freeway jump from their cars and begin belting out one of the films many unmemorable tunes chazelle sneaks his edits inside of whippans to give the illusion that this is all taking place in a single unbroken shot but his time may have better been spent working on the choreography  which seems to be comprised mainly of the dancers throwing their arms up in the air and then putting them back down again as with the full metal julliard histrionics of his previous picture whiplash theres no pleasure in the filmmaking here  just the blood sweat and gritted teeth of chazelles selfconscious virtuosity every frame of this film cries out are you not entertained five minutes in i wanted to pat the poor guy on the head give him a cookie and tell him its okay to chill out a little bitryan gosling and emma stone star as sebastian and mia two mismatched lovers struggling to be real artists in a city rotten with commercial compromise hes a jazz pianist one so committed to his art he gets himself fired from gigs all over town for refusing to play standards and improvising like a lunatic instead on their first date sebastian takes mia to a jazz club and mansplains the music to her in that especially insufferable way white boys have of putting people off the entire art form it should also be noted that for all of sebastians fanaticism he appears to have no qualms about loudly talking over a live performance mia wants to be an actress and claims shes an outcast because she loves old hollywood movies yet strangely all we see of this is her lying about a film she hasnt seen theres not really a character here just lots of vague idealism that emma stones considerable charisma somehow manages to make watchable as weve seen in films both decent crazy stupid love and unwatchable gangster squad she and gosling are enormously charming together their chemistry props up for far longer than it should particularly as these two struggle mightily with the singing and dancingspeaking as someone who still feels sorry for russell crowe and pierce brosnan ill never figure out why filmmakers continue to insist on casting actors with no musical theatre training in musicals were justin timberlake and anna kendrick really that busy anne hathaway not returning phone calls why go with the one guy from the mickey mouse club who didnt dance or sing chazelle studiously mimics the candycolored palates and elaborate soundstages of classic musicals and ticks off all the expected references without understanding that the pleasures of those old movies lie in their elegance and relaxed grace everythings about exertion with this dude the writerdirectors monastic bent comes up again in what becomes the movies misguided central conflict john legend pops up as a hugely successful musician who hires sebastian to play keyboards in his touring band but this dream gig isnt artistically pure enough for mia who attends an arena show at which much mockery is made of the audience for enjoying it pretty sure im not the first to point out that legends band is treated with the derision of ghost worlds blueshammerokay so it was here that i really started to hate mia her guys landed a job most musicians would kill for and shes chewing his broke ass out for not somehow magically finding the money to open his own jazz club instead shes also still a freaking barista at this point and lets not even get into the ugly optics of the two white leads with middling musical talent being held up as paragons of artistic integrity while john freakin legend is presented as some sort of sellout loser hes also the only black guy in this movie thats allegedly about jazz which at least is one more brother than was in chazelles last film about jazz this is progress i guess lunges for the bittersweet melancholy of jacques demys the umbrellas of cherbourg but has no interest in that movies heartbreaking economic realities the superentitled sebastian and mia have amazing career opportunities fall out of the sky into their laps and both get pretty much everything theyve ever wanted in the end without having to compromise or work very hard the final ten minutes of are undeniably effective just like the ludicrous ending of whiplash was because chazelle knows how to work an audience over until you say uncle as for the dopey received wisdom that nobodys making movies in this genre anymore on my tenbest list last year were both chiraq and magic mike xxl  two musicals full of more joy innovation and imagination in any given number than youll find in the entirety ofs labored freezedried replica,happy
i really dont enjoy giving reviews this low of a rate but when critics and the awards communities give something such high marks i expect to be impressed i most definitely was not i love cinema regardless of genre or time period and i love music i didnt get great or memorable music nor did i see a great film i really dont understand y critics were so enamored with this because it completely fell flat i am a fan of stone  gosling but compared to crazy stupid love their chemistry was atrocious actually they were worse than the horrible gangster squad this was supposed to be emotional and romantic but as a couple these 2 didnt experience anything worthwhile i just dont understand what critics were thinking when they reviewed this except the corn flicks movies reviewer who thankfully didnt jump on the bandwagoni honestly believe there wouldnt be as big of a backlash against this film if it wasnt for the huge praise it received critics had the public believing this could be the next singing in the rain and its barely better than high school musical 2 i actually liked the 1st one i just really hope  pray hollywood will stop believing their own hype and just make stuff that challenges the human brain yet entertains us,happy
a struggling actress and a struggling talented musician are the backdrop to this musicali am indian so i love musical movies and was so surprised seeing singin in the rain it was so beautiful so i came in with a little too much expectationi felt that the movie had too many songs it detracted from the story rather than adding to itsomehow emma stone was just not right for this part debbie reynolds and merylin monroe are the kind of actresses that are just perfect for this role a beautiful endearing smile and somehow you are rooting for them from the bottom of your heart relatively emma stone seems cold though she seems to be acting very wellryan gosling plays his usual cool dude performance and he does a fantastic job but i would have loved to see leonardo de caprio in this role it would have been stunningthey both have an interesting love story with the current trend of self deprecating jokes situation analysis etc which i am not a big fan of there are so many subtle things that i enjoyed like the car the studio the music things that you normally dont notice much when the drama takes center stage and the ending left me a little disappointed this is supposed to be an artistic movie so it was not supposed to have a typical hollywood ending still not happyfinally a hollywood musical is a special once in a blue moon thing and this just did not live up but thanks and i am happy this movie is a success and hoping to see similar and even better movies,happy
its not that i dont like musicals more likely its because i do that i found as mediocre a film as any ive seen in recent years so glad my wife felt the same it would have been hard to fake enthusiasm for any of itthe musicals of the golden age of hollywood had singers songwriters dancers and choreographers who were at the top of their game now in an apparent attempt to make the movies more authentic while maintaining the star quality necessary to get people to come star actors who are amateur singers and dancers are used there wasnt a memorable lyric or dance step in the entire 2 hoursafter reading the critics reviews it really seemed as though they were so excited that hollywood made a musical that they neglected to consider whether they had made a good one,happy
i finally got around to viewing this tonight and after reading all the hype i was disappointed i dont want to be too harsh on ryan gosling and emma stone because they are obviously not singers or dancers and it was brave of them to do thisto be honest i am not a lover of musicals but i do like jazz many times after seeing a movie whether it is a musical or not there is some music or song that sticks with me and i end up buying the soundtrack but that will not be the case withlast month i bought the newly released bluray of the boy friend by ken russell which i saw in a theatre in 1971 and is one of the few musicals that i love while watching i couldnt help but think how it paled in comparison to the boy friend in terms of music dancing and amazing musical numbers,happy
i didnt really care for this movie it had a terrible plot i think gosling and stone did an excellent job with what they were given but they werent given much i didnt give one hoot about either of these people especially emma stones character i did not like her good performance but not of a likable characternot only was this movie not very interesting in the beginning or middle but the ending was seriously trite she does become a famous actress he does get his jazz club rightthe songs were not memorable the only thing i liked was the small montage of various la spots and at the very least they used the hermosa beach pier for one scene and didnt go for the overclichd santa monica pier but really this movie had nothing to do with los angeles this was the la of people who have lived here for about 2 years and havent got a clue this was the la of people in the industry which are in my opinion not real angelenos people who work in the entertainment industry seem to think that this is what la is about and its really a very small portion of what this city is about believe it or not los angeles is a real place but this movie was fake fake fake,happy
insipid uninspiring and totally contrived lala tries to be a love letter to la but instead became rather dreary and predictable and la wasnt particularly shown to best advantage either it was moulin rouge without the excitement pizazz or pacing and thats not a particularly high bar after the opening scene which has been done elsewhere it devolved into more clich with mediocre dancing and singing the saddest part for me is that i love romantic movies and i found no genuine chemistry between the main characters every note rang false except for the energetic musical performances which contrasted sharply with the low energy elsewhere,happy
only 2 moviesseries can be compared to this junk twilight and 50 shades of grey the movie was boring with no chemistry between the main characters whatsoever i didnt believe for a second they were in love it was all forced and unrealistic the acting is so bad i cant believe they are being paid to be so badand the music wow i have nothing against musicalsbut the music here was not even a little bit good or interesting and sadlythis junk has the most oscar nominations since titanic what a joke only proves that oscars mean nothing and its just about who your friends are in the committee i dont understand the high rating it hasbut i nothing surprises me today anymore,happy
there was a time i remember sometime during the midtolate 90s when the idea of watching a musical was laughable it was a silly trend that was once popular with the moviegoing audience back when cinema was relatively primitive which saw a kitschy revival in the 70s and 80s with the likes of grease 1978 and xanadu 1980 but died a death when the rapid evolution of cgi made anything possible on screen then came moulin rouge and its use of modernised classic tunes in 2001 and moviegoers have been in love with the genre again ever since its popularity shows no sign of stopping either and writerdirector damien chazelle who made a big impression in 2014 with the excellent whiplash has sculpted one of the best musicals of recent times with the oscarnominated a film that manages to feel both traditional and contemporarythe film combines two elements clearly dear to chazelle the lavish musicals of the 1950s and to a lesser degree the 40s and pure jazz the two wandering souls at the storys centre dream of leaving their mark in their respected fields but both are in love with the past in industries always looking forward actress mia emma stone spends time between humiliating and soulcrushing auditions serving coffee near a studio lot where she occasionally crosses paths with a glamorous star as the rest of the room whisper excitedly musician sebastian ryan gosling cannot resist ignoring the festive playlist at his restaurant haunt in favour of some improvisation on the piano  much to the annoyance of his boss bill jk simmons  while he dreams of opening his own traditional jazz bar sebastian is quick tempered neurotic and plain rude but mia pursues him anyway they fall in love and express their feelings through impromptu songand dance routineschazelle knows the genre inside out and seems to favour the lavish mgm musicals and the glamorous physicality of the eras stars such as gene kelly fred astaire and ginger rogers opening with a near oneshot songanddance routine beautifully photographed by linus sandgren it goes on to deliver many dazzling and classical numbers which are often glorious to behold and backed by a soundtrack of memorable tunes that manage to stay in your head for days afterwards they are performed admirably by the central pair who have real chemistry one of the few saving graces of the amazing spiderman films was the chemistry between stone and andrew garfield and here she sizzles with gosling its the movies main strength rather than merely go through the motions and familiar tropes you really want them to be together you can truly feel their happiness every time they see each otherstutters when exploring deeper more complex themes the second act sees the two achieve some degree of success with mia developing a onewoman show and sebastian joining up with a fellow musician played by john legend in a band making waves in the world of jazz will mia ultimately degrade herself in order to make it in a brutal industry that may not deserve her and how can sebastian a hardcore oldschooler be happy in a flashy group looking to move the genre forward it seems like a poor excuse to simply tear the couple apart to experience their inevitable rough patch and doesnt really fully explore the characters emotional quandaries but this slight lag doesnt last for very long and the final moments are simply perfect one of the great things about whiplash was that final heart pounding moment of physical and spiritual triumph and wraps up the story with grace and genuine tugs on the heartstrings proving itself to be much more than a mere homage,happy
what an overhyped musical i love musicals from stage to screen but this one is really one of the worst i have ever seen apart from the camera work i cant find any redeeming qualities in this movie bad cast bad music bad storyline nothing to hold my interest i just kept forwarding the movie for the more interesting parts and then found myself forwarding again after one minute or twohonestly i havent seen a hollywood movie in ages but i thought id give this one a chance after hearing so many positive reviews turned out they were all hype all outright lies i am done with the media and sheeple society,happy
it is not fully awful reason why i rated 2 instead of one another reason is i love the director but not as much as the two actorshonestly it is the first bad movie i see featuring emma stone  i loved all her performances even the very first moviesbut not this oneat all she is a great actress but a poor dancer and a poor singer  too bad she is even surpassed on the subject by ryan that i also truly love not much to through away in his career mel gibson did an incredible job in what women want dancing with a hat in his apartmentall people loving ryans dancing should immediately watch that memorable scene with meloverall i agree with the 1 2 or 3 stars ratingsit is a huge disappointment  but check it for yourself because you never know you might enjoy it my daughter loved itand she is a great person with clear judgment,happy
i had been hearing about this movie for dayskept reading everywhere how good it isand decided to go see it worst decision ever ever i love me some musicals dont get me wrong but this movie was so boring that my friends and i had decided to walk out thirty minutes in it was supposed to be a comedy yeah i dont know about that just another overrated movie but i do want to give it up to ryan he did an amazing job and that he was the only good thing about this movie coming from an emma stone fan it didnt deserve all the golden globes that it got hopefully the next goslingstone movie will be better cuz they do have a great chemistry,happy
i like musicals but i must say i am a little disappointed by this one sometimes it is easier to make your verdict if you compare two movies of the same genre to get your opinion straight  baz luhrmans moulin rouge is imo in every aspect superior to the story more drama the music singing and dancing superior also the settings and visuals  superior imo first of all the story of is  mediocre and so are the characters the story of is more of a soap opera than drama and so it lacks of depth and for a comedy well i miss the elements of comedy mostly i like ryan gosling and emma stone a lot as actors but compared to the performances and chemistry of ewan mcgregor and nicole kidman they just look mediocre  i mean kidman dying in the arms of mcgregor is more worth than all ofalso if i compare with sweeney todd it loses  the story the characters of the latter are just far more interesting i didnt liked the music of sweeney todd a lot but at least the story was interesting and captivating enough to hold my attention in i wasnt emotionally invested into the characters and in the music at all ofc i am no lover of jazz but i remember that the movie whiplash about the drumming kid got me invested and i liked the passion and stuff conveyed by the maestro teaching his classes and the young talented guy i also liked the tunes also another recent musical les misrables with jackman crowe and hathaway beats easy okay i know les misrables is a classic but the execution is just superb imho plays in the league of into the woods kendrick streep  chris pine latter got its problems with the story but imo the tunes and singing performances are still a notch better so all in all i would say for a musical the music the dancing the story is okayish the acting good but i would only recommend for lovers of the genre who must see them all if someone would ask me what musical he or she should watch for an introduction to the musical genre would not be on my list or well far from the top tbh  if this is oscar material it just shows imo that the quality of recent hollywood outputs dont belong to the best ryan and emma both already have done much better movies before,happy
i went in with high expectations and the dance number at the beginning boded well i understood this was an about hollywood movie with a storyline that had been done repeatedly but that is okay and the actors should have been up to the task many of the musical numbers had a quality that reminded me of les demoiselles de rochefort which is a film i enjoy  indeed i felt that jacques demy must have been a muse for this director the problem is when there wasnt music the story was flat and turgid the main comment i heard from others in the audience was that the movie was boring the movie could have cut 30 minutes from the dramatic scenes and the total effect would have been much improved my suggestion is wait until you can record it on dvr and fast forward to play the musical parts,happy
ill call it right now will win best picture at the academy awards and for no other reason than the fact that the academy loves a film about the industry if theres a film based around movies in anyway amongst the nominees list put your money on it to win does it deserve the award no there were many superior films released in 2016hollywood seems to be obsessed with ryan gosling and emma stone as a couple this is their third film appearance together and for my liking they just get worse every time comparing the chemistry for example to gosling and rachel mcadams in the notebook they are worlds apart stone is a very good actress as far as emotional range goes but she cant pull off the likable tag very welli really enjoyed damien chazelles previous film whiplash in a lot of ways they are very similar films but in the more important ways they are worlds apart the biggest difference is the modesty that whiplash achieved it had great characters yet it acted like it didnt know it has very average even poor occasionally characters yet acts like theyre gods gift to cinemai was really disappointed coming out of even though i knew it wasnt my type of film ideally i was willing to give it a chance and thought it might surprise me due to my low expectations on the contrary though it managed to fall below my expectations my advice would be dont be fooled by the reviews and probable oscar nominations theres nothing to see here,happy
i just watched this a second time someone in the crowd very catchy and upbeat and city of stars emotional are clearly the highlight songs of this film i love those songs it made me cry the second time watching it especially when ryan starts playing city of stars for emma that part is very touching sorry there is no way this movie is a 910 currently it will definitely go down once the hype dies down i was excited to see this but i think it is being overhyped too much i think its better if you go in with low expectationsi understand this movie is refreshing than the typical usual marvel comic super hero movies or animated movies always coming out in theaters but its being too overhyped as if its the best moviemusical ever is everyone not really focusing on the story and just rating on the visual its like people criticize michael bay films right away because most of his action movies have a clich generic plot even though visually he knows how to show action well people seem to forgive the generic storyline of because of the visuals this is no 500 days of summer that was released in 2009 now thats a feel good movie from start to finish that breaks some clich which is easily a way better film than thisand has a better messagei cant help it but compare this movie to 500 days because the whole different seasons things it takes place in la some musical scenes about pursuing dreamsromancewhat if it happened this way instead and that but 500 days of summer is just a way better solid movie underneath the surface take away all the dancing and nice costumes just actually feels less magical than 500 days this movie also reminds me of the artist which im sure most people have forgotten by now  was a major overrated over hyped oscar win where it was clearly praised on the visualtechnical levelhomage because there really wasnt an interesting plot and the story was just bland and generic honestly who really cares about oscar wins anymore  the people voting choices are always predictable will smith did not force me to write this like another dreadful boring overrated movie spotlight won just because it was controversial subject this is a musical so they will randomly start singing like in disney movies but the musical parts werent as memorable catchy or exciting as i imagined or was hoping for from all the hype it doesnt sound like real music but just actors just trying to sing lines in a musical way i dont think its on the same level as moulin rouge it actually came off more comical whenever ryan gosling just randomly starts singing joseph gordonlevitt can sing but i dont think ryan gosling has that singing level even though 500 days of summer isnt a musical i enjoyed that films musical parts and is way more memorable and feelgood griffith observatory was underwhelming also its such a waste to see these nice large production setsextras yet the camera just pans fast across becoming just a complete motion blur again 500 days of summer made la look beautiful than it really is and felt more memorable they made that angels knoll park iconic i just dont remember any memorable moments except the opening freeway which is impressive on a production level but it wasnt as legendary classic level or worth the hype as it just felt out of place just randomly happening in the beginning of the film clearly they just wanted to open the film with some sort of big bang but its the same as throwing in a michael bay action sequence when theres no substance to the story i was more thinking during that scene why are we watching these people dance suddenlyi dont feel the romance between ryan and emma at all their chemistry is more like siblings the director relied too much on ryanemmas chemistry reputation from their previous films together theyre both very talented but i didnt feel the romance at all the part where they say i love you to each other was cringe worthyhard to believe in fact for them to get together is extremely forced and clich in this film i get the clich formula already where they act like they hate each other in the beginning but suddenly fall in love but this one is so rushed for them to get together it seems like the story was a second afterthought and the dancingsets were more of the priority theres a very ironic line in the film where john legend says about being stuck in the old jazz from the past being a traditionalist wont bring the wave for the future yet this film still tries to be in the old days of hollywood the film was shot in cinemascope i thought the projection at the theater i saw this at was really bad  the colors were so dullfaded  but apparently this was how it was shotjust out of nowhere sell out john legend comes to the rescue and out of nowhere out of all things on emmas last audition where we expect to hear her maybe share about her whole magical experience with ryan which may be cheesy instead she brings up about her aunt which is even cheesier like where did that come from in harsh reality dreams may come true the irony in dreams dreams may not always come true,happy
wow great cast terrible movie the flow of this movie is bad its like they look for another scene to play another boring song boring characters and setting make for a dreary movie give this one a miss its bad,happy
i must admit that i am not even such a big fan of musicals so i wasnt necessarily disappointed by the music but this was one of the most boring movies i have ever seen in my life i almost couldnt finish it i was expecting to like this as the imagery was beautiful and i like almost any love story no matter the style of the movie but each scene was void of any feeling the story was nothing i am sorry but i really couldnt enjoy it,happy
my mind is still trying to find the good in this filmbut each time i do i ended up laughing and saying ugh why why i just cannot understand why it has won so many awards the ugly truth isits rubbish mostly sure the colour and editing are great but the rest is just boring and tryinghard i didnt feel the movie theres nothing in it that would make me feel so into the characters nor the story the climax is missing and thus nothing to look forward to in the ending and in between scenes they would painstakingly insert singing and dancing that dont go very well with the scenario the music is unpleasant to the ears no recall at all the opening number is awful who wrote that what kind of music is that haha oh my emma stones acting is the worst her facial expressions were awful you can tell she is just acting as opposed to being drawn to the character because it feels real hers is fake acting no emotions no heart if im given the chance to interview ryan gosling i would ask what made him accept this role which story has more value the notebook or the story is just as awful as the acting the plots boring i cannot tell where the climax is transition is rough dance movements  been there done that if you have watched moulin rouge the sound of music singin in the rain grease chicago and the likes you would agree how terrible is i begin to wonder to those people who find this the best film theyve watched were they just been born yesterday damien chazelle is a lucky newbie director the award giving bodies surprisingly liked it however awful it really is,happy
it started out ok but then i got the feeling throughout the movie that the filmmakers tries so hard making it the kind of movie it wants to be a movie where it seems natural to start dancing and singing anytime but it dont thats the major problem for me they just dont get away with it it tries to be relaxed special and weird in a good way artistic but it just dont and it huuurts then theres the fact that many scenes seems to have been made without any effort of perfecting them theres a long shot were the main characters are small talking on a distance where they have obviously been doing voiceovers of themselves the lips arent even following their wordsthen theres no chemistry between gosling and stone theyre just being stiff specially gosling whos even more stiff when dancing hes pretty cute though and its absolutely outrageous that stone won an oscar for this havent seen the other nominated movies but i find it hard to understand that someone couldnt be better than thatand what is the movie even about its not a story worth building a movie upon it could be a sidetrack in a bigger film it dont justify itself too long too pretentiousmr legend on the other hand is what his name says a legend hes totally funny and the music is sometimes worth the while even if its really not that catchy overall i find it weird that its so hyped i guess its our generation that havent seen the classic movies in this genre and think its something new when its really a poor effort of recreating a concept that used to touch,happy
wow  what a production good music i said good  not great this is no grease and dancing unfortunately emma stone cant sing dance or act but ryan gosling is terrific in it he can do it all  what a talentthere was absolutely no chemistry between the two of them it got so whenever they kissed i looked awayit was painful to watch i kept thinking throughout the movie  why the hell did they chose her for the lead rolli teared up a bit in the observatory screen when dancing in the stars really beautiful for me that one screen was worth watching the entire movieand of course this goes without saying in every hollywood movie  it was waaaayyyy too long,happy
i went to see this movie because i like ryan gosling as an actor i discovered him after i watched blue valentine and was very surprised that he is not just another pretty face but a really talented strong actor but if i saw first i wouldve probably had completely different opinion about himmovie is bad it is not romantic at all the chemistry between gosling and stone nonexistent it is boring and not movingryan please dont play in something like that again ,happy
i have nothing to say about landscapes or acting especially emma stone was charming in the movie and thats it scenario is so simple songs and dances are just ordinary i dont understand how it is so overrated and compare this with singin in the rain just get on my nerves i cant believe this is nominated for 14 oscars well this year wasnt very successful for cinema history anyway but still 14 nomination same as titanic and all about eve it is just unacceptableto sum up if you are really bored and just want to watch a movie for passing time you can give it a shot i am not saying it is a bad movie just an average nothing special classic hollywood movie thats it,happy
dont get me wrong i appreciate damien chazelle as a director his whiplash is a classic but not in film school and damien if you read this you should now and i know you will read it you sold a lot of yourself to the producers in this one i know you had a pure heart and wanted to make an indie film and knew it wont go far but hollywood inflated it like a pretentious balloon this is a pure hollywood automatic driver car film  it was stated that the dancing and singing was intentionally natural and nor professional because it will add to the authenticity of having normal people acting come on wake up guys a dancing musical and singing should portray a great example of professionalism because that was this genre is all about you cant make a romanticdrama and just add some amateur dancing and quality production music and make it a musicalthe music production in this film was great and that is itdancing was mediocreacting was averagethe sets were copied from old musicals even camerasthey were so blurry because they filmed on the original old cameras and lensesi dont mind that but it does not work for me like that an old 35mm camera in a modern coffee shop is so pertinent damien i love you but you ate the blue pill by friend i know you are a very talented director musician but please distance yourself from hollywood because they took your film as their ownlike chicago and crash dont imitate the oldiesdo something that raises a middle finger to the establishment i like the music production songs are great in this film and that the ending has a nostalgic feel and it can have a powerful but the restwhen you make an overall statementits just like any hollywood fake flower show us real stories like you did with whiplash,happy
negatives what a joke for almost a decade or more many tv hosts and actors has joked that bollywood actor and actresses start dancing around trees for no reason which is not true hold and behold that is exactly what happens in and awards are given to that movie as a beautiful gem it is worse than bollywood as there is no music in the beginning and feels so forced also the movie is supposed to be in present age yet songs are in 50s and it really confuses viewers  why is she taking a coffee order on digital pad this rant is more not for the film but the hypocrisy of hollywood and really amplifies that when musicals made in bollywood are looked down upon or longer movies but when half decent job is done it is given accoladespositives good story line and showing struggles of actors and californian lifebroadway sort of music love ending i should say it again love endingloved acting as wellamazing work very good love story and a really great movie for closure for a couple ,happy
ok we re not so down with the movies but we expected to see a combination of marry poppins and the diary after seeing all the reviews and oscar nominations but what the hell was thatdo they think in hollywood that we re brain dead zombies and we re gonna fall for this crapdont spend a dime and time for this better look at your ceiling for 2 hours its more productiveimdb metric system isnt trustworthy after this for sure,happy
if youre a fan of old musicals stay far far away from this movie its just incredibly painful to watch its not that i dont like ryan gosling and emma stone its just that they cant dance or sing neither of them would ever even be considered to audition for any of our popular tv talent shows i tried to give this movie a chance but it just kept getting worse and worse from the horrible opening dance scene some guy jumping his bicycle all over cars in a traffic jam really to every time emma or ryan opened their mouth to sing it was all so painful to watch and hear i would have been better off watching some sappy hallmark movie,happy
this was a huge disappointment all the hoopla all the awards frankly i dont see what the draw was the acting wasnt stellar the music i would rather watch anything with lerner and lowe or rogers and hammerstein musicand i mean anything the choreography was humdrum i could do those dances try a ginger rogersfred astaire dance number if you really want to see talent ps its not just me i dont know one person who loved this film im glad i only spent 115 at redbox,happy
i came into this with low expectations it has managed to surprise me with how utterly boring and awkward it isit is beautiful the shots the costumes the works that is one thing he has going for him and i now completely understand a big reason why i found cloverfield lane so amusing to watch even though its over the top and weird he truly has moments of brilliance in setting up a scenebut as a story and a musical its incredibly boring the songs are completely forgettable for the most part the singing is using soft falsetto voices making it often difficult to read any emotion from them and in some cases even difficult to understand at some points the dancing of our stars seems like they are just trying to get the steps right theres no ease of movement that musical lovers are expecting and are used to when you take into account that the choreographies themselves are not that grand or impressive it makes it even more obvious that our stars had no time to think about the emotion of the scene but were focused on getting the steps right theres no lightness to it when you compare it to classical gene kelly movies for example it makes it very boring to watch because there is no chemistry i found myself more interested in the costumes and the back rounds than the charactersits not funny but its not serious enough either and emma stone is amazing for funny for me at least this one didnt get a laugh out of me it didnt get me invested in the characters either i think its partly because for the longest time the movie makes us think the characters themselves dont really care so why should we and this kind of superficiality would work if the music numbers were more exciting and funthere is a reason audrey h was dubbed in certain movies they understood that they needed a strong clear big voicethis movies choices baffle methe only reason i can honestly think of this being praised this much is people going along with professional critic and the movie attracting an audience that hasnt seen musicals before with emma and gosling i could understand how someone who hasnt seen any of the amazing musicals out there would be in love with this movie and if this movie inspires them to look those up and see what they are missing ill be satisfied,happy
sowe went to see this film as a family today what a disappointment  where did all the hype come from for this film  the actors are decent but are not great at singing or dancing which is a major issue for this type of productionthe story is threadbarethe characters are frankly dullwhat is there to like  so as a familywe thought it was poor entertainmentthe people who left the cinema part way through never to returnpresumably thought it poor also we spoke to friends afterwards who have also been to see itthought it was rubbish alsothere is a theme here folksso we read up about the film after and read there is a backlashas frankly the film doesnt deserve the hype which frankly begs the question where all the hype has come from so the film is released just before the oscarsthe critics ravethe public is told you must love this film people vote positivelyor are they genuine reviewsand dont get me started on the criticsim sorry but people have had the wool pulled over their eyesthis isnt worth the time or money to see,happy
i feel like john galt standing alone in a throng of mindless sheep i watched the entire running this film is tripe stuffed with regurgitated everything i get the whole stage dressingtheater sets  set atmosphere thing however it was so heavy handed that it lost its flavor and appears to be an overused budget tool after watching it i saw it as a collage of stereotypes from all the old musicals relaying heavily on a film model that was stale and even crusty at points that said i was amazed at ryan goslings piano shots he was sublime on the keyboard shots and learning to play for this movie nothing cheap or clich about talent both he and emma stone did a great job of transitioning from their respective scenes into those musical numbers i found myself amazed that she could be carrying me through a scene just to have her leave me in disbelief that that it was but an intro to a campy song this movie is nothing but a tribute band to a bye gone era put together today in some kids dorm room it is quaintly filled with drag queenesque songs and endless clichs the actors made this movie happen they earned their money,happy
throughout the picture damien chazelle doesnt take a decision on what kind of picture to show the film appears to be a random collage from a number of chapters from some cyclopedia about film makingbeing rapidly dragged through diverse genres heartlessly knitted together its hard to get emotionally bound with the story or with the characters in the picturei felt like a 1st grade student watching a training movie presenting a sketch of different genre stylesthe base story a becoming of age story is obtrusively filled with all kinds of styles i was permanently asking myself why is he doing this now whats his motivation whats the storys motivation for example  i guess the musical elements where supposed to convey love emotion but why have the actors been so unemotionally even dismissively playing it  whats been the reason for taking so much time for conveying that the mia character is an actress that fact doesnt add to the story at all there is an utterly awesome long lasting uncut scene its a performance highlight but why on earth is it applied to a negligible chat between lovers  why are all the musical artists depicted in the film so emotionless i understand the jazz club scene as a reminiscence to the jazz club scene in the glenn miller story but how dull is the version compared to that  speaking of dull the score was extremely boring cheap jazz licks carelessly arranged in the musical scenes i was very much in doubt whether the musical text was meant to be serious or ironic i was asking myself is this a fourth wall movie or was this a movie with a story to cling to all in all to me the movie appeared to be some kind of a bachelors academic thesis and i dont understand what makes the movie worth a nomination for even one single academy award,happy

while there was some fanciful silly plotting i enjoyed while i was watching it  probably to the level of a 9 or 10 rating it was fun and funny and romantic and beautiful and magical emma and ryan are talented and very appealing whether separately or together the fact that they are not especially gifted as singers and dancers didnt bother me at all in fact i found that to be charming the musical numbers were engaging and satisfactory if not particularly memorable it would be unfair to compare this movie to classic movie musicals because its really a whole different animalhowever in reflecting on the movie afterwards i felt a bit cheated so i dropped my score a couple of notches and decided i had to write a rare for me review my experience was like fully relishing a whole tub of buttered popcorn and then coming to my senses afterward my first clue that something was off was how i felt at the end of the movie  not thrilled not heartbroken  just disappointed and a bit confused in reflecting on this feeling i realized that it wasnt that the characters didnt have sufficient chemistry for me to feel something rather the scriptplotting let them downthe basic story is about two cute kids exploring their dreams in la who meet and fall in love the audiences dream is that these two can make it as a couple despite inevitable setbacks along the way if a storyteller is going to dash that dream he or she needs a darn good explanation there isnt one here the two kids rather magically and in relatively short order from a realworld perspective achieve their career goals presumably at the cost of their romance are we really to believe that they had to choose one or the other  and that if so these two dreamers would choose career achievement over love the two breakup scenes were both totally lacking in terms of convincing the audience that this pair might be ultimately incompatible or should not keep working on their relationship and enjoying one anotherso i was robbed of a satisfying resolution i was leaning toward a 7 rating but i think ive talked myself into a 6,happy
i had been anticipating this movie since i am such a big fan of whiplash hearing that it would be a musical only made me more curious to see what damien chazelle had in store for us so i was really excited when i was able to score tickets to a screening at tiffi came away very impressed im not sure if i would call this a masterpiece yet but its certainly close damien chazelle has brilliantly crafted a beautiful film a great achievement and truly deserves to be seen by even the harshest skeptic chazelle is starting to show that he is one of best directors and has quickly become one of my favourite film makers in hollywood the cinematography is fantastic this film is beautiful the scenes pop out of the screen and feel magical at certain parts and while i was watching i couldnt help but think that this is the type of ambitious filmmaking that we have been missing lately i wish studios would take more chances with original material and realize that it doesnt just have to always be rebootsreimaginingsryan gosling plays sebastian a jazz musician and does a good job doing so but make no mistake this is emma stones film and she truly excels in her role as mia an aspiring actress stones portrayal is absolutely wonderful and will most certainly be recognized by the academy the rest of the cast are also excellent and even though jk simmons part is relatively short he still manages to steal the scenes that he is inthe musical numbers are great from the exciting opening highway number to the closing somber look at what life could have been for sebastian and mia but its emma stones rendition of audition that truly stands outrarely does a film remind me of the reasons of why i fell in love with filmmaking but did just that and definitely brought me back to the early days where i was truly discovering just how spectacular filmmaking can be95 out of 10,happy
i wanted to like it but sadly it just didnt live up to the hype for me as hard as they tried ryan reynolds and emma stone just came across as amateurish in the musical numbers and i couldnt help but think how much better it could have been with a donald oconnor and debbie reynolds in the leads but of course theres no one of that musical caliber around these days no memorable songs either even the much talked about opening number on the freeway was a letdown bunch of people jumping on and over cars a few unimpressive dance moves and some incoherent song i doubt busby berkley would have given it the thumbs up why everyones raving about this film is a mystery to me i can only assume theres a lot of people out there who have never seen a musical from the 30s 40s or 50s maybe it would have worked better if theyd set it in the 50s and left out the modern non melodic pop songs also thought the ending was quite bizarre a good try i suppose but it just fell flat for me sorry,happy
they couldnt reach each others dreams if they didnt get into each others lives they reached out to their dreams but that prevented their lovethose songs the gosling and stone duet the final scene emma stone and goslings performance were great,happy
the vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time this movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to hollywood of yesteryear but also that of a timeless love story gosling and stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers all these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers i was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by goslings piano i absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone,happy
well i have imdb for a long time and i am using it consistently but i had never written a review at first i was skeptical about musicals but while i was watching aladdin in the theaters even though the musics werent that great i discovered that i can love musicals i love emma stone as an actress and i was truly amazed by her performance in netflix series maniac after i searched her in imdb i found out that she won an oscar from so i started to watch it man it was beautiful the cast the plot and the conflict it was beatiful conflict wasnt cliche as being in love with another boy or girl the conflict was just a simple disagreement between couples and all couples are at some point of their life having this problem in their life i loved how they fell in love at the beginning of film unlike other films which involves lovehappy ending in the end of the movie the perspectives help us to emphatize with both of the characters and the songs were pure magnificent i expected that ending will be like this but it still broke my heart the director and writers did a wonderful job by just showing what would happen if mia and sebastian are together and at that moment i just cried i dont know why but it just broke mestill this movie has problems in it the film is stating that mia and sebastian had never seen them again which is kind of dumb because they were still lovimng each other and the distance is not an obstacle for love and from mias perspective i saw that she adapted really quickly after 5 years she had found a man who she loved enough to marry him and after that she had two kids she became so famous in 5 years but she was at least 18 months pregnant for two kids and adding the care to newborn children it became 30 months25 years so in just 25 years she became so famous and considering one film is made in about 15 years it is kind of weird even she became famous she had to find her love in just one month which id also opposite to her love to sebastiani really wanted to give this movie a 10 but i didnt like how and why they had seperated but it still had put lots of tears on my facethis is my first review i am under 18 and i am not a native english speaker,happy
i usually dont like these kind of movies which is full of musics and dances but this movie was amazing because i liked the type of musics here the videography was awesome and the story was enjoyable,happy
its not bold its not daring it doesnt say anything profound about the american film industry it has no reason for existing other than for the purpose of winning academy awards,happy
i think lala land is overrated may be it got all the awards and most surprisingly the oscar because it was a musical if they grew up watching bollywood they would have known that nothing about the movie was remarkableas regards the story i dont understand why the couple split they couldnt make it work long distance for 3 months,happy
i think i have never seen a film full of hypocrisy obvious boring and without any interest like this what a scary thud for the great gosling from drive and only god forgives to this pantomime that wants to make the verse to the 50s musical movies which in fact was stuff of 70 seventy years ago and there they had to stop  a hypocritical film for the mass,happy
starts off with an odd piece imagine the busiest highway in your city suddenly turning into a singalong with everyone dancing outside of their cars shortly after that it bursts into a classic magical film laced with love the freight of dreams and the will to not give up on themi was a little bit skeptical at first not having been a huge fan of musicals in the past but i was very wrong its more of a movie then a musical the musical as i think about it is just the cherry on top of an already brilliant script is filled with those simultaneous conflicts between dreams and reality hence the singing and the musical aspect of the film this makes it for the dreamers and the realists alikedo you want to make your dreams come true but youre dealing with some internal conflicts then this movie is for you if you dont care about dreams this movie is still for you,happy
this was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen we were with another couple and they wanted to leave after about 40 minutes we convinced them to stay but probably shouldnt have we kept thinking it must get better  but sadly no as others have commented the acting was poor possibly due to the incredibly idiotic story line the dancing looked like a high school music review the singing  lets just say if you slept through it you were blessed how this movie got so many awards is beyond me i thought maybe it was my age i called my millennial son who also watched it with his wife and they both agreed it was a poor movie,happy
a tribute to high musicals with worse actors 14 nominations give me a break i grew up on musicals and these people come no where near gene kelly or fred astaire musicals west side story chicago chorus line or others both ryan gosling and emma stone were highly miscast in this disaster with all the unknown actors on broadway who could perform on a higher level could they not find two for the lead roles unknowns would have made it a better movie for those who claim to love it do yourself a favor take a weekend and rent some real musicals a tribute to gene kelly rent singing in the rain and watch the master during the shooting of the rain scene gene was deathly ill with a high fever he should have been hospitalized but instead he did the scene remember that when you watch it,happy
there have been many posts that rightly knock this film but i have to add mine it seems the world has gone mad politically socially and culturally  if people think this is the best film of the year and some re saying the best film they have seen then we must be in it is terrible from start to finish bad songs bad singing bad dancing bad wait no plot no chemistry no emotion a flat zombiefied utterly dull film that is witless pointless and a waste of time along with fences and a few other award films this joins the group of films that are not just overrrated but in reality go way beyond bad it seems that the public reading all the over the top revues have gone in determined to like it but there are a good many of us that can see through it to these people if you have not rated it please do so now and give it a 1 rating to counter the ridiculous number of 10s,happy
i personally know many people whove seen this film  and all of them hate it every other review ive written is based on my own viewing  but im making an exception for this dreadful film it sounds so bad that i havent seen it and am repeating what they said  rather than subjecting myself to the hell of watching ithere are the problems with this filma its boring  especially in the middle its far too long for its contentb ryan gosling and emma stone are mediocre at singing and dancing good singing and dancing are essential in a musical film c goslings character is an arrogant snob who thinks that anyone who doesnt love jazz is beneath himd stones character lacks a personalitye its too unrealistic for anyone to take seriously as a romantic dramaf theres nowhere near enough humour for it to work as a comedythe critics and fans dont address these bad points they dont deny them  they just ignore those faults or claim that they arent a problem,happy
the most magical cinematic experience ive ever had in my life its simply perfect and i wished i wouldve have seen it more than twice in theaters the colors are just simply gorgeous and its meaning about dreams is so inspiring yet depressing it hurts me when i see people give this negative reviews i adore this film and its everlasting impact on me,happy
i ventured to my local cinema to see this movie on the basis of a number of excellent reviews by critics and patrons on here i will admit that a musical is not my normal preference for a movie but as i love both emma stone and ryan gosling and with these reviews in mind how could i not go and see it the opening sequence was quite impressive and i also knew from the start that the cinematography was going to be to my liking old style cinemascope with great coloring unfortunately thats about where it stopped the ongoing story line was very weak and the music was even weaker  its not that gosling and stone performed awfully but moana has better song list than this the movie limped along through its two hours becoming more and more predictable as it progressedvery disappointingi have to really question how this movie could have been nominated for 11 golden globes and actually won 7 when there are movies such as hell or high water and arrival and nocturnal animals out there  all of which were considerably ahead of this my only assumption is that like the artist a few years ago this is a result of a wrist kissing exercise by tinsel town  aiming once again to congratulate themselves on how wonderful they think they are seriously peeps whilst its not absolutely awful its also nothing special and certainly not as special as this critics are making it out to be to be,happy
with its gangbusters intro appropriately taking place in an la traffic jam looks like it is about to serve notice on the american film musical with an exuberant energy informing the audience it is in for a fun ride the energy level however begins to waver when the dependence switches from music and dancing to melodrama and the film divided into seasons like la has them begins to stumble just before autumn sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone first meet in less than amicable fashion on the everyday bumper to bumper existence of the la freeway actress mia works as a barista on a film lot and spends time off going to casting calls that end in disappointment sebastian is a quirky purist jazz pianist and his own worst enemy when it comes to being employed the two cross paths again hookup and continue their artistic struggle for recognition when success knocks on both doors it threatens the future of the relationship offers up a handful of well done musical numbers imaginative dance scenes as well as a some early comic friction between the leads but the story line remains banal director damien chazelle attempts to circumvent this by adding some what if moments to the story to give it more life but it only packs on more minutes to this already overlong musicalas bargain basement fred and ginger the duo offer less than fancy footwork along with pedestrian singing voices but that is part of their charm stone at least looks like she is enjoying herself while digging deep enough dramatically to hold some of the films more torpid dramatic scenes together gosling is simply a lightweight whose abrasive character offers little to like to begin with and his singing and dancing along with a series of faraway stares grows tiresome by the second half and what started out with the promising chops of another cabaret eventually degenerates into the mawkish graceless excess of new york new york,happy
ive always enjoyed musicals though theyve been sadly few and far between in recent years so when this came along with great publicity it seemed a good option to fill a hot australian summers daytheres not much point going into details this show doesnt merit the effort apart from a little reasonable jazz the musical score is unexciting and the main theme is both inane and forgettable so much for it being a musical it doesnt come close to even the reasonable musicals of the past think les miserables or xanadu let alone the many gene kellyfred astaireginger rogerscyd charisse classicsthe acting is not bad but neither of the main characters could be considered either an interesting or pleasant person he is ignorant and ill mannered while she is a nobody with pretensions and neither of them ranks as a singerwhich leaves only the story and the plot is trivial boy meets girl etci scored this as a 6 on the basis that id probably sit through this again on tv if there was nothing else showing but dont waste your money going to a theatre to see it,happy
after getting over the fact neither of the two actors in this movie deserve leading roles i steeled myself to watch this movie and thought id give it the benefit of the doubtthe movie starts with a song and dance on the freeway and everyone getting out of their vehicles and dancing and singing together sadly this was supposed to be one of the highlights of the movie as i said i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but the first song was forgettable boring and the voices weak the dancing looked extremely forced and clumsyas the movie progressed i couldnt believe how bad it actually was i dont know anything about ryan gosling other than he is no leading man in my view contrary to what others would have you believe he is not handsome eyes too close together a very long face and a perpetual gormless look emma stone isnt much betterit was actually very difficult to watch the entire movie its slow and amateurish and looks like it was directed by a 15 year old the sets look cheap and the whole thing made on a budget of 500it also seemed like it was made in the late 1970s a tv musical wholly forgettable highly overrated madly so its criminalavoid unless youre being paid well by someone to say its great,happy
in real life most people dont randomly break out in song and dance but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing movie fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture only the second film to win the academy award for best picture was a musical 1929s the broadway melody oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals but they never went away some of the bestloved musicals in film history eg meet me in st louis and singin in the rain came out in the 10year span 19441953 but the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals west side story the sound of music and oliver all best picture oscar winners from the 1960s willy wonka and the chocolate factory grease and all that jazz 1970s victorvictoria little shop of horrors and the little mermaid 1980s beauty and the beast the lion king and evita 1990s and in the early 2000s moulin rouge frozen dreamgirls and chicago which became the first musical in 34 years to win best picture2016s pg13 208 is the purest original nonadapted live action musical in many years and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002s chicago was written and directed by damien chazelle who was the writerdirector of 2014s whiplash which earned him oscar nods for his script and his film this one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by chazelles previous collaborator justin hurwitz with lyrics by the awardwinning musical theater team known as pasek and paul musician john legend has a major role in the film and its stars emma stone and ryan gosling are both past oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies  2011s crazy stupid love and 2013s gangster squad and yes they both sing and dance while telling this particular musicals story of romance dreams and hope it takes place in the present but feels like a throwback  like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryearthe films title has a dual meaning 1 referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and 2 the city of los angeles itself where most of the action takes place in fact the film opens with a songanddance number with commuters stuck on a typically gridlocked la highway at the very end of that scene aspiring actress mia dolan stone has a random brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist sebastian wilder gosling who acts like a real pianist the two run into each other again in sebastians jazz club immediately after hes fired by the club owner jk simmons for insisting on playing his own music sebastian is no more polite this time the two finally meet cute and before long mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with sebastianneither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers but they sure do try hard at both mia continues working as a barista on the warner bros studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition eventually she decides that her best way forward is to write finance and produce a onewoman show which fittingly focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in nevada and moving to to pursue her dreams after dropping the humorously humiliating job where mia sees him at their third encounter sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club but doesnt really do much about it he reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance legend but doesnt enjoy it because they dont play his style of pure jazz sebastians unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward mia just as her show is about to open the eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers but shows what happens when life doesnt go as weve plannedis a wonderful movie but not as some reviewers would lead you to believe flawless after three contentious encounters the two main characters just suddenly fall in love a development that isnt very well earned by the script or the acting otherwise the performances are excellent especially stones and the script is funny poignant and grounded except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song but when they do those songs are both fun and touching the dancing however seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older hollywood musicals that inspired this film having said all that i have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective this is a very entertaining and affecting movie youll likely be emotionally invested in these characters smile a lot  and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack for someone who wants more variety and positivity in todays films this one is a gift a,happy

dont believe at my words please just see this moviei am first time writing a review for a movie because sometimes you have to explain your feelingsthis is movie about a persons who dreamsand they have a faith to achieveeven lots of dialogues in the movie depict that they want to achieve their dream no matter what happensboth emma and ryan were amazing this is the most heart breaking movie i have seen in yearsis a inspiring movie even background score and songs as much inspiring it is perfectly composedand this movie makes you believe that dream is conflict and compromising it means that you dont get always what you wantit is perfectly directed shot to shot by damienand this truly establishes director works at his bestand this movie is truly a musical modern classicits conflict ending and twist will definitely make you crythe level of drama dance and cinematography makes this movie more beautifulthere is one scene in which they recreated the whole movie is truly epici dont know what to saybut still i am writing this so you all can see this moviesongs like city of stars will keep you hummingand in the end i will say that always follow your dreams no matter what never care about what should people think because they will always has to say something what so never listen to themand in pursue of your dream never forget your beloved ones,happy
i dragged my gf to watch this film and both of us left feeling a bit so what i cant critisise a film because they do great great marketing but the oscar nominations obviously mean something and i cannot see why the committee thinks so highly of it i was thinking about films to compare it with and the nearest was pretty woman which is head and shoulders better so why the two leads showed very little chemistry between them both of them seemingly only halfinterested in life drifting from scene to scene the filming has a very studiolot feel about it slightly artificial and cartoonish im sure thats what they wanted it just seemed weak and the music has virtually no memorable numbers i so wanted to like this film but,happy
what i liked ryan gosling  whats not to love about such a talented endearing genuinely gifted actor who is also so gloriously easy on the eye emma stones portrayal of a wouldbe starlet mia is both believable and engaging the cinematography though far from innovative definitely compliments the plot providing an essential dynamism and facilitates a colourful landscape upon which the story sits comfortably the films score is irrefutably blatant in its repetitiveness yet nonetheless befits the plot and at times is both heart rending and catchy the plot while hardly novel in concept rather a mulch of countless lets make it big in hollywood films of the past still manages to command interesti didnt fall asleep indeed i felt myself rooting for the film and experienced an overwhelming keenness for it to realise success what let it down both ryan and emma are certainly accomplished young actors who are completely lovable and engaging so much so dear reader that i am almost ashamed to lament that neither can really sing so lets be real now how can one hope to deliver a seminal musical piece if the lead characters pipes dont cut the mustard add to that a distinct lack of chemistry between him and her reexamine their on screen kissesthe passion just aint there an overly repetitive score a far too obvious plot line weird are they on acid scenes that simply dont fit and far far too many lulls in the plot line where many people in the movie theatre started chatting or going to the toilet etc and youre left with a film that sadly can only be described as average in my opinion hollywood is so desperate to resurrect a time honoured musical tradition that it has blindly bought in to desperately touting it an exemplar of musical excellence for the millennium when in truth the film offers little more than a pedestrian jaunt along a lane oft tread albeit doing so with significantly less pizzaz than its predecessors if im honest however i must attend to the question of why i harbour so much guilt at leaving such a disconsolate review perhaps i am missing a trick it is possible that this is a film that warrants a second watch or a particular kind of viewer to really get it i advise you to watch it and judge for yourself,happy
i appreciate the effort to put on a big musical but other than the main theme the music wasnt that memorable and the dancing mediocre i like both stars but think it was a reach for both of them to sing and dance again  appreciate the effortthe songs didnt really tell or move the story along aka greaseand i found myself dozing during themi would have given the movie a 2 but the last 5 minutes at least delivered a satisfying endingand big pluswatch this one at home where you can fastforward through the dance numbers after you have had enough of them,happy
has dominated the 20162017 oscar nominations and is another example of hollywood hypeit is a nice film but also an overly hyped product for the benefit of the chinese money in back of the production hollywood is drooling over the chinese these days at the thought of them financing more and more of our movies and this one in particular is like a musical promotion of the the us film industryas for the film while it had good acting directing and cinemaphotography it had no memorable musical numbers and had a lousy ending combing elements films the way we were and the last temptation of christ it had me leaving the cinema less than satisfied in that respect it violated the old rule a light musical romance must have a happy ending it began on a high and moronically and inexplicably ended on a low,happy
when my friend and i went to see this movie we were both excited as we both love musicals however even though we thought the movie was cute we noticed right away that it was not even close to wonderful the singing voices were soso and the acting and dancing were okay but not academy award material we both did think the ending was a unique idea giving us both a look at something new but not enough to gain the whole move as award winning material we did think the opening number was quite spectacular and are still trying to agree on how they accomplished it not sure why people are going crazy over this movie as we both found it as only a cute fluff movie,happy
a pleasant enough watch but no where near as good a film as the pr hype would have the songs are okay  but i did not leave the cinema humming with any one of them stuck in my head and the dance routines are again  okay if the leads could really sing and dance more could have been made of this okay material but the fact is while the voices are on pitch and in rhythm and the steps are all in the right place and time neither of the performances infused any excitementcontrast their dancing with the opening ensemble dance and song  danced by dancers i did not feel there was much chemistry between the characters in summary this was not the hollywood musical reborn rather an adequate homage to the genre,happy
damien chazelle whose father is french has made a gallic tinged song and dance musical set in los angeles in some ways it is a modern variant of singin in the rain but without the overt optimism which modern life does not have the film has wowed the critics at the awards season but i think like the film the artist it might not stand up to scrutiny a few years laterthis is a bittersweet love story between sebastian ryan gosling a jazz pianist passionate about the golden age of jazz and wanting to open his own club to play the type of jazz he wants before it really does go to obscurity he keeps on bumping into mia emma stone an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the warner bros studio lot and goes to endless auditions looking for that big break but only to find disinterested casting agentsboth of them are looking for that big break but find each other slowly at first but love may not be enough when these people also crave success sebastian finds it first recording and touring with a successful group which puts their relationship under a straindirector damien chazelle dazzles with a big opening musical number in a traffic jam on the highway but the energy of that number cannot be sustained like many modern musicals these days the songs are anaemic and unmemorable not helped with some of the jazz numbers the film is right much of the audience will be put off by the jazz musicthe dance numbers between the pair is meant to be easy going than emulate fred n ginger and in some ways it works chazelle as in in his previous film whiplash has found a rhythm to his film it has a sentiment that individual pursuit for your dreams may be the price worth paying for true love the story although at times tender as well as abrasive is not strong enough and the film really did feel stretched,happy
musicals of the past left you humming the tunes as you left the theater this is the first time i have seen a musical without a single memorable song im not sure what this film is trying to be the story is as dull as can be and the acting doesnt even really mater because its all broken up by terrible dance numbers i really wanted to like this and in fact did not read any reviews so i wouldnt be swayed but it was apparent from the first number that this movie was just an extension of the terrible music that is considered popular today its as if they just randomly picked notes and placed words together and expected it to be good its the same reason why the top of the music charts are filled with soundalike music with no feelingthe acting was wooden and the script dulli had to rate this with 1 star just to counterbalance all the outrageous reviews calling this a masterpiece,happy
having just gotten back from seeing with a rare day off music college it came to me that it was one of the best new releasefirst viewings for me in a whilevery few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed a beaming smile on my face tears in my eyes feeling uplifted and properly moved however has managed that feat would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after disneys renaissance period in the 90s and very much a modern classic am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations including being a record breaker at the golden globes and if it does well at the oscars as well there will be no complaints from meclicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age hollywood musicals a somewhat maligned genre these days but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts due to being there myself the talent was also appetising starring ryan gosling and emma stone directed by whiplashs damien chazelle and featuring cameo support from jk simmons who coincidentally won a best supporting actor oscar for whiplash john legend and rosemarie dewittit was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so having seen a lot of stuff recently film and tv that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on itvisually is a gorgeouslooking film with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography thats not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into selfindulgent territory the music and songs may induce and has induced mixed reactions count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious emotionfilled and with enough to make one toptap and hum alongthe musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with nonstop exuberance the opening number is especially true to this the script is warm funny affectionate and poignant and also with an honesty its not a complex script nor did it need to be and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple the story is admittedly slight in places then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmospheresomething that is true with a film where anybody can relate to its themes even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age especially those with mgm with their bold colour exuberant marriage of music and dance it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like the umbrellas of cherbourg yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences loved that the two leads relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the loveatfirstsight sort far from it more antagonists turned lovers with a meet cute first encounter again also not a casechazelles direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and filmmaking more than evident in execution that is affectionate and fulloflife rather than selfindulgent the chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work no worries there ryan gosling and emma stone look so natural and at ease together nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflictsboth of them give terrific performances performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about especially stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance so many emotions such as vulnerability strength cheekiness charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavyhanded touch gosling matches her if not quite as good showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm all the support although basically cameos registers memorablyall in all a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away 1010 bethany cox,happy
musicals dont necessarily have to have leading stars who can sing and dance frank sinatra was no great dancer but managed to hold his own rene zellweger was dwarfed next to catherine zeta and christian bales santa fe ballad complete with cowboy dance in newsies is downright laughable hell rex harrison spoke his songs rather than sing them  but given incredible music we the audience can forgive a lot that being said its not like hollywood is hurting for actors who can both sing and dance neil patrick harris and kristen bell both immediately spring to mind now if youd paired those two in you might be able to overlook the huge glaring flaw in this musical the fact that the music stinks5 minutes in i was bored  i was supposed to be wowed with a huge musical opening number ala all that jazz carrying the banner sweeney todd or singing in the rain and instead i couldnt tell you the title of the song and i couldnt have been less blown away by the opening dance number boringthen we meet our protagonists and  i couldnt care less about either of them at 15 minutes in i was ready to bail out but i figured i should at least hear gosling sing and see both of them dance before i called it man am i sorry i waited at 30 minutes in we finally get to the first big songdance number and it just really could not have sucked worse if it were a preschool production if that was all the singing required couldnt they have cast channing tatum im sure his voice could have been auto tuned as much as goslings and hes an excellent dancer everyone made fun of helena bonham carters ms lovett because of her airy nothing of a voice  well emma wishes she had the lung capacity of ms carter midway through the train wreck of the first musical number i couldnt take any more if id seen it in a theater id have demanded my money back i heard theres some good john legend moments  ill just try to find them on youtube so hollywood casts not 1 but 2 actors who cant sing or dance worth a lick in a musical with utterly bland and completely forgettable music how is this rated 86 stars why is this film not overwhelmingly panned by critics is this what passes for good from hollywood now because if so they should just turn in the keys because the whole place is bound to go down in flames any second,happy
this is a film so painfully aware of itself it knows the exact number of wrinkles in its own anus at the same time it is inexplicably oblivious of its anus primary function controlling the egress of fecal matter lots of pretty technical wonders are pooped onto the screen but they dont really serve any purpose except to drown out sounds of the films bowel movements,happy
fortunately i have got this dvd as a gift from a family member and i didnt spent one cent for this boring musical i waited with my wife thirty minutes and still didnt happen something really interesting there is no substantial story or any suspense i am asking how if is possible that this one got six oscars thrown away instead of giving these to better films that have been done last year i cannot believe it but it confirms that i am right to not watch the oscar shows it is not the first time that a boring movie got so many oscars and i am not wondering i highly recommend it if you cannot sleep because i assure you that after some minutes you are falling asleep 310,happy
i did like many others fall for the hype do not believe this is in any way a good movie this film was predictable at every turn the characters had little to no chemistry and on top of that the plot stood almost stillon the plus side the settings and costumes where a delight if you like jazz the music is solid the casting were goodall in all it was boring,happy
this is my first review of any film on imdb i saw this film as it has won multiple oscars and the story showed some premise i had not seen the trailer after watching the movie i was like why i wasted my time on this i should have gone to watch meri pyari bindu heck even ok jaanu was way more fun and better love story than this bollywood really knows how to make love stories specially the intense ones westerns often bash bollywood movies for their music and dance numbers which according to them erupt spontaneously then what was in this movie some melodious songs some over the top dance steps there is recent trend in bollywood movies to incorporate the songs with the storyline so that it is not a hindrance in the progress of the story watch dangal for example my final words are if this movie can win oscar than heck 25 of bollywood movies also can if any of you really liked this movie due to the musicdancelove story saga you are gladly invited to the world of bollywood,happy
never have i been more upset at wasting 2 hours of life i have seen my fair share of garbage but now tops the list heres an idea for producers considering a musical  hire singers and dancers and then teach them to act enough to hold someones attention do not do what the producers of this heap of steamy crap did and bring in two actors and then try to get them to sing and dance gossling is massively miscast he must have some sort of talent to still be making movies but it certainly is not singing and dancing i imagine everyone involved in any musical prior to this one is either rolling in their graves or if still living are making plans to do so stay as far away from this puss bowl of boringness as you can now we all know why the academy took back the best picture oscar,happy
i dont understand all the hype about this movie spoiler alert the music was good but that is all the movie had going for it just a mishmash of scenes terrible ending neither star could sing acting was ok but certainly nothing to get an oscar for emma stone deserved an oscar for  the help but not for this mess i love movies but this was painful to watch 13 oscar nominations insane,happy
i usually dont use the word the worst to describe a movie but sometimes you have no other choicesthe opening reminded me of those stupid teen songs of todays that give me goose bumps outta disgust whenever i accidentally see them on tv the story is boring and worn out the music is forgettable and it gave me a headache that i wont be able to study tomorrow the dancing is an uglified singin in the rain and the performances are mediocre except for emmas who also didnt deserve to win and a nomination was enough for isabelle huppert was so perfect in elle the award was hers and hers only the only thing worth watching in this movie was the cinematographyit couldve been an ok average movie if it wasnt for all the hype but after the built up expectations its one harsh slap in the face when you finally sit through it waiting for something extraordinary,happy
i am quite unsure what this romantic notion of la is but every few years a film pops up trying to glamorize hollywood and they are ludicrous i had to suffer through steve martin having a mid life crises and hugging lamp posts to this trivial bit of fluff once again trying to make la something its justnot come on people this is just a rehash of that horror of a film called la story what about something fresh the only people enthralled with movie lots and old world jazz is all of you or wanna be yous as for the rest of us we want real stories please something with guts or good humor or at least depth of emotionget on it,happy
i didnt see so stupid movie for a long time it had terrible acting terrible music and an incredibly mindnumbing plotthe singing and dancing is absolutely awful the storytelling is so poor and predictable big waste of 2 hour of my life do not waste your time even planning to watch this one,happy
when theres genius in the acting the acting is above the script here the acting was at the script certainly not above it the singing and dancing looked practiced perhaps artful but not talented and certainly not genius if you want to watch talent and genius watch some cab calloway fred and ginger etc there were some good themes that grabbed me but the themes that grabbed me could have been in any movie genre simply not an implementation of the genre that satisfied the goal this is the ben hur remake of the classic music genre and does not deserve recordbreaking award nominations,happy
i tried to watch it but honestly i could not i felt pain i loved marry poppins i loved the sound of music yet i struggled to watch this one and i failed i simply could not finish it i do not understand why it is acclaimed and why it got the golden globe of course i have to write 10 lines of text and i will try just to be able to express my disappointment with this movie i do believe that there is something really wrong with these movies it brings back a memory from an oscar two years ago i think when another weird movie got the best movie it was the bird man no one liked no one spoke about it no one even remembers it it appears to me that the academy jury like to vote for movies about themselves movies about actors and acting that a closed circle without connection to the rest of the world,happy
another lost love story people that know me will confirm that i maybe dont know to cry but this movie really touched me if i knew how to cry this was my moment she didnt say hi wtfis definitely a sad movie and probably his purpose is to remind us the humans how stupidly we choose money and a job over love the feeling that many pretend is the focus of their life it is sad to forget what is really important and lose someone over a job choice i find it painful to have the what if in your shoulders but again we all have a different understanding of what happiness means the first part of the movie is quite slow so be ready to give it a chance it is worth it is not much auction there but again you know youre going to a romancei loved the fact that the story started and ended in winter like the two main characters probably where feeling he hitting the rock bottom trying to find a way to make some money without giving up on his dream and she is training to keep her smile up while at every single audition is rejected and ignored the beginning remind me of bewitched they keep running into each other like they were supposed to be together the moment the movie starts you will think they hate each other so much they have to be together is like they are made for each other which by the half of the movie the story line proves you were right they do belong togetheris a triumph on so many levels and hopefully a lesson for many single people to think twice before they decide their life this guy give up his career because she asked to and she she didnt say hi wtf,happy
   what can i say aboutfirst off let me say that i love musicals i cant wait to see sing i love music documentaries even if i dont like the artistes yes oasis im looking at you or even if i havent heard of the band anvil the story of anvil and i adore films that feature great tracks such as sing street or films that feature tracks by the rolling stones or the boss but plummets to new depths of banality and superficiality in fact the title sums it up ideally the only time it perked up is towards the endgosling and stone do well in their roles but they can do better the singing and dancing is nothing special and should not be compared to the magical musicals starring the likes of fred astaire and ginger rodgers etci do not understand all the oscar buzz in fact if this wins the best film oscar i will scream my little head offwhiplash was wonderful but damien chazelle has not made a comparably decent follow up in fact the woefully underused jk simmons should have thrown a cymbal at his head whilst screaming this is dragging 510,happy
i saw this at the cinema on its release as we walked out myself and others were heard to mutter certainly not a musical so what was it all aboutto classify it as a musical is a misnomer one or two production numbers and the same musical number played over again doth not a musical make the scene where gosling and stone attempt to dance on a hill overlooking la was absolutely cringeworthy for any real dancers watching  and really  does she happen to have her tap shoes with her after leaving a party  just watch that scene closely againno it was far from awesome although clearly ryan gosling worked hard at learning the piano so must be commended for thatnot a film i would want to sit through again but this is the only place i can vent my spleen or be generous with praise as i cannot be bothered with social media ,happy
i can not believe this film got so many awards and why everyone was raving about it poor storyline no wonder they dont make musicals anymore they cant compete with the musicals of the 40s and 50s id rather watch paint dry,happy
i dont understand the hype of this moviesingers were sub par like the actingsongs were not memorable or entertainingcliche cliche clicheugh get me out walked out with about 30 mins left of the movie as my girlfriend herself was not enjoying it as well just sad,happy
story is cliche boo hoo she thinks hes not following his dream eye rolls the songs are utterly not memorable the singing acting and dancing are meh to average this movie dragged for me its a miss this boring bland blah musical is beyond bad,happy
you dont need a great voice to carry a musical but you need to have an interesting voice a lot of the old time musicals pretty much had the likes of gene kelly and others have songs tailored to their limited range as singers even the silly mamma mia which suffered from cringeworthy screenplay and pierce brosnans earnest donkey braying benefited from the rich catalog of songs and performers immersing themselves into the songs no matter how bad they sounded rocky horror picture show made better use of the voices of non singers like sarandon and even though rocky horror was never considered oscar worthy  it actually has much superior songs to more lauded movies like is just flat out lacking in even semi memorable songs with great melodies and even the non musical sequences are drab and stilted in the beginning of the movie which kind of makes you impatient right off the bat the first half hour there is only one semi compelling scene where emma stone is auditioning for a role so it puts you in a mood not to give this movie the patience it probably needs the first scene that grabs my attention is the pool scene with the 80s cover band by an overeager cheesy singer who entertained me more than the other singers in the movie then the movie descends into mediocrity again where ryan gosling and emma stone have a duet where the song does their voices and our ears no favor ryan goslings voice comes across as a bored half hearted rendition after someone just woke him up in this song at that point i just gave up on the movie and watched the rest of it as i did other stuff emma stone had a better mini musical with her funny snl skitles jeunes de paris set in a french coffee shop than what we saw here ryan and emma are both good actors and just wasted in a sloppily directed effort this movie somehow achieved what i thought was impossible  make emma stone seem boring when she was having fun dancing i dont understand the cinematography wow factor herethe imagery looks more akin to late 2000s hd cinematography with the lack of adequate vibrancy in the colors and contrast,happy
i like the colours  there ive said something positive so hopefully that fulfils the required impartiality quotienti appreciate the craft and its obviously been made with a lot of love but this just was not my thing at all its the ultimate stagebrat movie i have a lot of sympathy for those types of people i took drama classes but they tend to become grating after awhile  and this film grated on me really fast life is not light and frothy sometimes we have to do things we dont like dont ask me to coddle selfindulgencei knew going in that i wasnt a fan of musicals so you may ask why i freely chose to watch this the answer is that  as with any genre  occasionally i find an example that surprises me top hat chicago moulin rouge unfortunately i found no such surprises here the best part of watching it was knowing that as soon as i finished it id never have to see it again ive done my duty as an oscars devotee and movie buff but now i need the palate cleansing of trainspotting 2 as soon as possible,happy
spoilers ahead this review refer to people that have seen the filmhere is to fools who dreamhere is to jazz that is merely just a shadow of its former self in 1940  or 1950 or in a place out of time it is dying and dreamers seem to be its only hope and what an irony that is jazz is a way of life and a way of thinking and it is sinking along with the sebastians of this wordthis movie really succeeds in making us feel what jazz is all about not 10 minutes in you already know jazz is not about the musical notes and tabs jazz is about freedom it is about expressing what you feel unbounded  respecting everyones jazz around you jazz is what makes you want to dance in the middle of the street even though you are in a car stuck in the traffic jazz is love if a parallelism is possible and how can it not be possible if the signs are so many jazz and love are the driving power of expression and creativity love is the highest achievement of anyone of us and what makes determines who we are as jazz is to a musician sadly both have never been bleeding so heavily and in these dark times indeed for jazz a change is needed to make it lovable again in this new age may this be an electronic sound or a compromise to a shortest version of your life longest dream no sebastians would ever accept it much like love that is dying in our time and age love needed to and has changed from what we used to see in the films its not limitless and as romantic as it used to be  it is jazz with electronic inputs  it has changed so much in order to survive this new age that can it be even called love anymore in this question mia ans sebastian say no love is a wonderful kind of music that doesnt have to be mutated to exist  and if times wont accept it it can exist in a city of stars in their minds inside a look in a bar after so many yearsthis movie is a glimpse of the old love and jazz that adds so much colour to a black and white today,happy
what a disappointment not a musical musical acts are scarce and scattered there is only one recognizable tune the others are instantly forgotten not a love story stone and gosling show no chemistry no passion not a film about jazz apart from a few corny clichsthe film has been successful so i guess it must have had some appeal but this hollywood self celebratory so called return of the musical didnt win me over,happy
i cannot understand all the good reviews this has had it is boring and depressing a dull story with characters its hard to care about this is hollywood being selfindulgentneither lead can sing or dance well this i would have thought would be a prerequisite for a musicalthe first two song  dance sequences were uninspiring though the later ones were a slight improvement the finale was quite good in terms of editingsome of the jazz piano etc was good but otherwise theres only one original catchy tune in the whole movie  and youll be sick of hearing it by the end,happy
i was so pumped to see this movie because i had heard so many people talking about it from the first scene to the final i had a hard time keeping my eyes open i found there was little action or drama or anything to keep me drawn to the movie i was hoping at some point that it would take off and i would experience what other people were talking about that did not happen for me i would never purchase this movie let alone ever watch it again very disappointing ryan gosling should stick to other genres of movies as his musical and dancing talents are sorely lacking,happy
how this film won so many awards is beyond me the musical numbers expect for the opening number were rubbish and the plot vey thin the singing was ok but nothing special and the dancing was bad expect the opening number and the songs were not cathy the woody allen musical comedy everyone says i love you was much better so see that film not thank you,happy
the unimpressive opening dance number sets the tone for this mishegoss of a film yet another case of the academy ie anyone with a sag card voting for films that they have clearly never seen how this qualified as a socalled musical is truly a mystery the musical numbers totaled less than 10minutes zero chemistry and zero character study between the main stars stilted dialogue that chewed at my ears with no semblance of a plot lala land was nothing more than an excuse to create lavish sets despite my cousin having coproduced this film i will still stand by my educated review in the end an actors actor always chooses nyc over lala land,happy
boredom to the nth power to hate to detest to loathe to abhor these are all verbs that fall short to describe how i felt when i had the privilege to watch this movie film piece of crap or whatever other words used to describe this utter gross and unforgettable felony this la la l land should stand before the international criminal court to answer for its outrageous crimes against humanity i couldnt leave since i was the guy projecting the movie i wish i had had a can of petrol and a lighter to set the screen on fire the audience would have applaud at leastthe half of it that had remained sitting and winning the eternal salvation can anyone tell me what the hell the story was about after one hour nothing happened after two hours the same the best part was when it ended thank god for having listened to my prayers the whole movie was forgettable after 5 minutes but the feeling and imprint left in my brain will not disappear in a thousand years and for sure i will need psychiatric assistance from now on i have that single piano key sounding in my mind continuously there are no language or words that could describe this attack on intelligence and human dignity please do not watch this movie for gods sake youll save your money time and mental health the story was beyond rubbish the music id rather be deaf the acting was below absolute zero and the lengthoh my god have you ever watched the neverending story that one did have an end but this one was the real neverending story so eternal so boring the worst worst movie ive seen in 40 years and most of the merit goes to the fact that they tried to sell it as the best of the best but it really is the best of the worst it was awarded 6 oscars how come did the jury toss a coin to see who wins them this is a kind of musical that would hurt a deaf persons ears and i totally agree with one reviewer finding nemo is much better light years better than this crap crap land i didnt actually have great expectations about it maybe just killing time but it was beyond any expectations imaginable in the opposite direction it was so slow that instead of a motion picture it seemed a projecting of a trillion slides never again i swear,happy
im disappointed because the whole time i was waiting for the scene everyone told me about where ryan goslings character admits to emma stones character that he got pregnant in the butt by john legends character and then he gets really stiff with his arms to his side and shoots off like a rocket with flames coming out of his feet and then thats the end of the movie what gives,happy
the most magical part is without ever watching it three or fourth times my mind is already stumbled with all the lyrics and lines according to a reviewer though i didnt know if its original i think it applies to everyone after years when you if the songs again you might not remember the lines but you could always hynm it along most importantly because of someone the movie eventually has meanings to me too,happy
i watch a lot of movies and are fairy easy to please but to say a movie is outstanding or terrible it really has to be amazing or woeful is a pile of steaming sht that is the most tragic boring and uninspired piece of cinemai only last half of the film and has to leave it was pathetic,happy
the story characters songs costumes and the cinematographys color are perfect i watched it many times and always enjoyed this movie showed us the stages of relationship like in our normal life lol,happy
i made an acoount just to give this movie 110 dont waste your time i was very curious when everybody was talking about this movie but oh gosh i cant stand this if i was 15 years old maybe,happy
i heard that this movie reminded people of old movies which led to a slew of good reviewsi love emma stone and i love ryan gosling i thought that they were wonderful together in crazy stupid love and i admit to liking a lot of weird and strange movies right now my favorite movie is mr right with anna kendrick and sam rockwell see it so funi watch old movies all the time this did not remind me of an old movie it had a lot of singing in it by nonsingersi tried to watch this i did i couldnt get past the first twenty minutes i was bored then in hopes that it might generate some interest for me i watched the last 45 minutes still meh i dont care about these characters and i found that the songs distanced me from them they didnt seem real but rather were like caricatures of real people the last five minutes was really pretty to watch but still  did not careso if youre wondering what all the hype was about and cant figure it out youre not alone,happy
i was so disappointed with this movie i adore old hollywood musicals but if this was supposed to be a tipping of the hat in tribute to them then im afraid the hat fell off  was trampled by a stampede of cinema goers exiting the theatre demanding a refund how on earth did it win so many awards a raspberry id believe but the others sheeshthe story line was slow  boring im a big fan of emma stone but in this movie she looked thin  unwell her singing  dancing were terrible she was about as graceful as a newborn giraffe i cant believe the wonderful mandy moore choreographed this drivel im not a fan of ryan gosling so his performance didnt disappoint as i already had low expectations there was nothing memorable about this film below average thank goodness i saw it for free or id be stomping on that hat myself,happy
a excruciatingly slow moving movie a movie for patient viewers not worth the time nor expense for hyperactive folks decent acting hopefully these actors and actresses will get better movies in the future avoid viewing in theaters due to their high cost  freebie bed bugs etc go for low cost internet streaming where possible,happy
i gave 2 rating for the message otherwise id have given 1 let me ask you one question have you ever watched bollywood movie in any of your answer id like to conclude that bollywood movies are boring because they have song concept  a dance concept in the middle of the movie well it follows the same way if you watch this movie your life will become different you will definitely see your time more precious  will never try to watch these type of melodramatic movies again and if you have free time you may like it its just too much of overrating i realised that oscar can be given to any senseless movie,happy
the start is almost as good as a firstrate super bowl commercial unfortunately that part has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie seriously if theyd just spent 90 minutes singing and dancing on the freeway im sure it would have been a much better movie there is one other very brief good funny part but its buried under 2 hours of boring whiny millennialstyle navelgazing drivelbtw its not that i hate all musicals as ive enjoyed some of the oldies on tcm well at least i did before i got cheap and cut back to basic cable but in any musical thats worth its weight in spit the guy gets the girl and youre left feeling upbeat this one is mostly just one big bummer,happy
first review because this movie is totally overrated  i love musical movies but what on earth happened for it to be so praised  just had to watch a few sequences from my fair lady after to be sure my judgment was not wrong that is a great musical not this another oscar winning movie who will appear in 10 years in the movies that shouldnt have won list you dont make a good or great movie because you do it in the style of the great ones and even that should you have a good story  and good songs  even in this area i could not remember one  and you dont feel any connections with characters in short terms  dont waste your time ,happy
this film is the most over rated film in the whole world why did it win so many awards i mean how in the world the film at the beginning is very boring and it seems like the story will never end why would someone see this film why the story line is boring and slow like a sloth well the acting is just average not amazing not excellent just average the director also did an average job to be honest but towards the ending the film got a bit better i like how the ending was not so obvious because i thought that in the ending they would be together but they got separated and carried on their own lives,happy
hollywood musical hollywood romantic comedy if you will mia emma stone is an attractive young lady pursuing showbiz fame serving coffee between auditions and meets sebastian ryan gosling a talented jazz pianist searching for his dream of owning his own jazz club romantic flirtations lead to an intense love affair but conflicting ambitions force them to make some tough choices and their relationship begins to fray and both will realize true love is too important to let slip awaysong and dance scenes could have been cut a little shorter for me but this movie is well written and acted scenery and sets are beautiful and some scenes just ooze romance by far should have won oscar for best picture gosling is charming and miss stone is what dreams are made ofalso in the cast jk simmons jessica rothe jason fuchs callie hernandez john legend terry walters tom everett scott and da wallach,happy
a jazz loving pianist falls for a wannabe actress and together supporting each other hope to one day achieve their lifetime dreams their attempt will prove to be much harder than expected putting their relationship in peril multiple timesits a joyful but dramatic musical which presents two ordinary people with big dreams and their struggle to achieve them it makes the viewer pass through multiple feelings from excitement and fun all the way to sadness and drama keeping him into its majestic atmosphere until the end this is a very good example of how a movie should be done how to shoot scenes how to build characters and how to put them into place the music and dancing also play a very important role in the act making it easier for the characters to express their feelings while also changing the mood of the sceneits a very good movie without any doubt but what disappointed me was the way the producers decided to end it you may accuse me of being oldschool and a fan of the fairytales for preferring a predictable happy ending but i truly think that it would have been the best approach when it comes to this one you may like the way it ends you might even consider it to be a happy ending who knows but for me this is the part which brought disappointment from an excellent movie and made me not give it full credit for its performance,happy
i hated the sound of music i hated chitty chitty bang bang i hate mary poppins i hated all of the music films from that era somehow in 2016 that format has finally been done right this movie is great the whole thing plays out like a stage performance the colours the lights the dancing the acting but the thing that ties it all together and makes it really shine as a stage show is the cinematography i love the long movement shots where its obvious that everyone had to be on point for their part even just the opening song is a huge feat in filming the stunts the dancing the singing and then both emma stone and ryan goslings separate acting parts the opening scene sets up the entire moviethe story i dont have too much to say about it its just a story its a polished easy to swallow love story theres nothing special about it and thats the only thing in my eyes that could be a let down but for what the movie is it works for it would the story make me watch it again no but the production mightmy favourite part of the whole movie is the stage show recap while ryans character plays the song its confusing throughout the whole thing i said she turned their story into a stage show oh no its a recap oh ryan is the girls dad oh no its ryans version of how it should have gone i was so confused but when he finally finished the song i was spenti would watch more movies like this if only for the production i hope maybe some day someone makes one of these films with an edgy story i want to see heroin not coke,happy
we indians love musicals and each movie we make irrespective of the language has songs and dances very rare we make a song less moviebut hats off to damien chazelle for writing and directing a musical which beats us in our own game after watching i wondered why we couldnt make a movie like this with the kind of talent bollywood and rest of the many regional language film industries india hasi dont know where to start about the story of young struggling actress and a jazz musician in la could have been a run of the mill film but damien is fine writer so he does include the clichs but also keeps small twists and turns in the story he tells the story in forms of the seasons in la and how life changes like the seasonsand when we audience think that all is fine he beautifully delivers the hammer blow at the end which left me speechless when i left the theatre i was wondering how my life is at the moment and how my life could have been if some dreams had come true my introspection is the result of power of writing pity he didnt won an oscar for writingevery frame in the movie looks like a painting and the movie deserves the oscar for cinematography and the music is outstandinggosling and stone are a fine couple on screen and their chemistry lifts this film to another level both of fabulous actors stone beautifully shows the pain of a struggler while gosling shows the unhappiness inspite achieving successwhether the film should have won the best film well after seeing moonlight i can tell but its a beautiful film that the reminds us that life will always have surprises,happy
sebastian ryan gosling a traditional jazz piano player and mia emma watson an aspiring actress meet and fall in love sebastians dream is to have his own jazz club and mias dream is to be a successful actress i told them i wanted westerns to be brought back and what they did was to bring back a musical a musical of all things well it wasnt too bad and it got a lot better after the first 15minutes when they showed a traffic jam on the freeway and everyone got out of their cars to sing and dance pretty lame and you could tell the voices were dubbed in what was i in for when this movie was nominated for all kinds of oscars someone should have seen those first 15minutes didnt work the music was not of the toetapping kind the dancing was okay i guess but way overdone i was beginning to think this was going to try too hard woe is us the story really starts when sebastian and mia meet and their chemistry was spot on kudos we hear them singing and see them dancing the choreography was excellent for two actors not known for singing and dancing hey it worked and was enjoyable to watch all the rest of the way mia decides her auditions werent working and starts to write a onewoman play sebastian is offered a job by keith john legend the music here is what i would call jazz rock and is meant to bring in the younger crowd because no one really likes traditional jazz anymore or that is what is commonly known sebastian doesnt really like this kind of music but its a job and he needs a job things work for a while until troubles come to paradise and we see dream conflicts oh ohthe music and choreography  after the first 15minutes  were very good and maybe those oscar nominations were deserved after all of course they were the movie did get oscars for best actress emma watson best director damien chazelle best original song city of stars and best original scorenotable jk simmons as bill who fires sebastian because he wouldnt play the traditional christmas music and ended up playing some serious jazz this may be the start of musical revivals but am still hoping someone will bring back the westerns 910violence no sex no nudity no language only on fbomb was heard,happy
i give a 6 only because there were some bright moments and actors were good but the story itself seriously boring nothing to keep you interested romance humor drama musical a little from everything but not enough just bland choreography had nothing special nothing to impress while its something to expect from a musical and singing scenes boring with no essence no weight no magic and there was no romance except some kissing and dancing at some point you want to stop watching but hey its ive been expecting this movie it looked so positive and stylish compared to violent superhero junk thats so popular these days such a disappointment a story who keeps you sad and bored life is unfair but then hey something is going on they meet each other and nah oh wait maybe finally they nah the end,happy
the main 2 characters were well developed but i felt the film lacked in depth and the story was very generic this felt like just another milked hollywood film with a lack of a plot the film did some things right  the main actors were great and their relationship felt pretty real overall this film was mediocre it did some things right but a lot of things wrong my score for is 610,happy
romantic warm successful in terms of actor and actress performance but still a little boringit was really a romantic movie it was like you feel the romance between gosling and stone you feel that they have strong feelings for each other and they show it in a cute way the scenes at which one of them makes the other one angry were not only sweet but also convincing stone and gosling both had great performance the fact that emma stone has won the oscar proves this although i believe oscar should have gone to natalie portman for her amazing performance in jackiealthough the movie was romantic and the main characters had great performance i found it a little slow and boring you feel the romance but you are not curious what will happen next the storyline could have been more exciting not only the storyline but also the musical scenes lead to boredom i must say that the musical scenes were completely disaster for me i just didnt like the songs and the dance maybe it was just not my thing,happy
plot does not exist it seems that the scenarios writer tried to satisfy the expectations of a teenage girl magic lovesing dance typical arguesdresses and heels i do not recommend this movie to an adult person but the worst thing was the absence of emotion especially ryan gosling was playing his role so badso blankly,happy
since i have heard so much about it i expected more and got much less i have no idea what the big fuss was about i expected a sound of music kind of movie and was disappointed in return it has no great music no great costumes  no great scenery and the dancing was not even up to par lacking in all elements of a good musical movie the 5 hence was for the acting only,happy
is a musical film written and directed by damian chazelle whiplash and starring emma stone and ryan gosling ill admit musicals are a guilty pleasure of mine but its been a while since i last saw one that i really got into thankfully has done just that with its memorable songs and clever choreographyin the city of los angeles aspiring actress mia dolan emma stone meets aspiring jazz pianist sebastian wilder ryan gosling and the two fall in love throughout the course of their relationship the couple strive harder and harder to make something of their potential careers in the fastpaced and surreal citythe film plays off as an affectionate tribute to the hollywood musicals of decades past complete with stylish dance choreography and bombastic set pieces also despite its jovial tone and brightlycoloured presentation there are plenty of bittersweet moments that prevent the film from becoming too sappy and overly sentimental the songs were all great and they all segued perfectly into the plot the chemistry between both emma stone and ryan gosling is fantastic both actors seem like they were having a blast filming their dancing and singing scenesi rate it 8510,happy
its very strange to me that i thought passengers was quite good and rather slow and boring the critics saw it the other way around disconcertingly i just dont agree with what the glowing reviews are saying about this movie i was checking my phone throughout i didnt see the magic here this film didnt blow me away despite what the critics were promising i didnt get iti wont say that i wasnt moved because it was moving near the end and thats always a sign of a good film i particularly liked the song about the aunt jumping in the seine more of this please however the people i was with didnt even appreciate this scene they thought the whole show was a waste of moneyi can see hollywood as a metaphor for following your dreams the theme of follow your dreams wherever they may lead you is a noble one i loved la story including the surrealist bits but maybe thats because of the character development im into movies but im not particularly into hollywood i hated the artist the singing and dancing just werent that great the surrealism and overt hollywoodness here felt cheesy and excessive to me did it go too far maybe perhaps i wanted more psychological insight more realistic character development and less fred and ginger this movie was a little too artsy and contrived for mestill i might see it again just to try to see what all the critics are seeing,happy
i saw this with my 80something godmother and we both had surprisingly similar reactions we both agreed that the film gets off to a slow start it was downright boring in the early scenes so much so that my godmother admitted she almost fell asleep the film picks up some muchneeded steam when it concentrates on the relationship between mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling and particularly comes alive whenever jazz takes center stagei found many of the early scenes a bit pretentious mia and her glamorous friends are struggling to make it but they live in a really welldecorated apartment have fabulous clothes and get invited to so many poolparties in the hollywood hills that you wonder when she manages to get enough hours at the coffee bar to put food on her table i also found the film lacking in terms of signing quality i have excellent hearing but had trouble understanding the lyrics to some of the numbers because everybody seemed to be whispering which is what unskilled people do when they try to sing none of the actors could belt out a tune save for reallife singer john legend finally i have to say the awful ending was a letdown why make a love letter to old hollywood musicals if youre not going to give us the ending that hollywood would have given us if this had been made in the 1950s this plot has been done many times before and much better girl and guy are fake and phony girl becomes star and leaves for hollywood guy gets left behind girl secretly pines for her regular guy guy finally gets up courage to seek her out and they live happily ever after would it have been so terrible to have mia become a success in hollywood and seb simultaneously realize his dream of opening a jazz club but have them both realize they were missing something in their lives like the love of their life and then meet cute again and go off into the sunset only one tune was memorable in this movie mostly due to its frequent repetition otherwise this was only an ok film,happy
my sisters were naturally my babysitters growing up they watched endless musicals ad nauseum years later i hear a melody and can practically see the dancers performing the routine associated with that melody after the oscar nominations i could only imagine my sisters both bursting forth with are you kidding you see after watching your first dozen musicals the expertise of truly memorable dance flow becomes evident going through the motions is normal flow expressive rhythmic flowing motion can be performed by pros flawlessly with every step though every step is not award worthymany current hollywood actorsactresses could have performed the same motions as gosling  stone many would have done a better job the point is  just flowing through the motions doesnt make any performance award worthy,happy
is just on show in china today i heard that it is a movie about romantic love and music so i decided to go for it with my girlfriend beyond my imagination it comes to an sad ending so sad that made me cryin la the city full of dream is not just like everyone dreamed many people lose themselves forgive their original intentioni have seen lots of movies in 2016 it is a truth that hollywood is getting worse is the only film that bring me in i could get the feeling of mia when she cries i cry when she smiles i smile music and dance are really great things in the worldthe movie also reminds me that i should do what i really like if you love music then just do it if you like movies then just go for it dont think too much about the final result even you are a successful man with an unhappy job it wont make you feel any sense of achievement following myself would be the most charming part of me i also read love from the movie the two persons just like having special chemical reaction with each other they are getting better and better while staying with each other this is exactly the kind of love that i want to have andi wish the love i have is the very kind of love i dont love her rich or success but her full passion and enthusiasm about life there are many versions of our life any single tiny decision could lead to a total different one and this is called butterfly effect i hope my love and i could go through the obstacles together one by one stronger and stronger during which we are getting better and better selves as wellhappy valentines day at last to you my love,happy
ive seen a lot of films over 1000 from all generations and all genres i saw every great film to come out this year yet nothing has hooked me from beginning to end quite like damien chazelles last film  whiplash  came quite close but this is a masterpiece if ive ever seen one its magnificent its stylish and cool and mindnumbingly beautiful this is the film that you must see this year it will make you laugh cry make your brain tingly and it just doesnt end youll have that movie high for at least a day after its everything you want trust me the score will stick with you for days and you will find yourself listening to every song multiple times over i cant recommend this film enough go see it,happy
i had very high expectations for but what a disappointment this should have been a broadway show not a movie i felt that the story linen was thin and very chaotic to me this was bollywood meets hollywood and it did not work at all why cant we just allow bollywood to make their great movies at least they are authentic the only positive thing about this movie was the acting i thought the actors did their best with the material they were given also the music was good but did not manage to carry through probably just better to buy the soundtrack do not recommend this movie but if you do go do so with low expectations that way you might get some enjoyment out of it,happy
and heres to the fools who dream crazy as they may seem heres to the hearts that break heres to the mess we makei really really love to discuss such heartwarming movies which deliver the full specter of positive to melancholic emotions but no negativity at all from damien chazelle is indeed an awaited masterpiece after his break performance with whiplash so much energy and genuine talent is represented in his scripts directing and music that i am truly inspired after watching his every film his producers are really joyful after working with him describing him as a very young visionary who really lives with his work and tell that after he is done with a movie he lingers on it long after the shooting is done maybe because for any true auteur every piece of art is like a new baby born by his imagination and hard work so this time he chose a more familiar cast  ryan gosling and emma stone the latter can really sing i think that they both got talent and am really a fan of goslings film project choices he truly does not have a failure yes i am looking at you newcoming blade runner movie so having also the chemistry between them two the director can only pinpoint the amazing yet pretty often used storyline i prefer not to speak so much about script rather than music and performances the feel which we get from this movie is rather energetic fresh and warm life is really nothing but a sequence of events which we truly must welcome and embrace not matter the costs of mistakes and misses the passion of the main characters for what they love and do is indeed great but it pales in front of these rare moments of togetherness in creativity which they have and thats why the third act is the strongest one when they break out they estrange from each other but not to the point of losing that connection which they have from the beginning and although people are born alone and constantly move on and change these two characters really resemble our ever lingering spirit of dreaming and high hopes even if the reality crumbles even if sebastian and mia choose separating paths they are bound to be together in their dreams and when those dreams come true they are happy despite the physical distance between them there is much wisdom in this film and the beautiful shots are really complimentary to the exact directing of the motion los angeles is a really nice scene for the story and the color palette of the movie is truly positive i want to point out the song which mia sings at the last casting  audition it truly made me smile because it represents a spirit which i dont really show but which i love and reminded to me of a very special person of mine also i want to express my deepest respect of the conclusion song and montage i really turned this 910 movie into 1010 for me love and creativity are truly strong forces in our lives they show our spirit and souls like nothing else and even our mind and perception are puzzled by the disappearing boundaries which are torn down by everlasting art,happy
sorry folks but for me a musical absolutely requires professional level singing and dancing and although gosling and stone are great actors and do an excellent job with a fun script neither one either dances or sings like a professional not even close the result comes across like one of those rather embarrassing and painful highschool musicals that you sit through because your child is in itthe costumes and set design were great and i really liked the music i think the movie would have been much better if they had just done voiceovers for the songs then we would only have needed to overlook the amateur dancingthe plot is a modified romcom plot but since this isnt a spoiler review you will have to see it to find out how it deviates from the standard linei saw this movie with my daughter who is an aficionado of movie musicals she was annoyed at the rampant borrowing from classics such as the umbrellas of cherbourg an american in paris and singing in the rain although this point is worth mentioning i think many if not most viewers will not noticewe just watched singing in the rain last night in honor of debbie reynolds if you want to see what a great musical actually looks and sounds like you can rent it from amazon then make your own comparison,happy
ive been waiting for a return of the unabashed musical and this one announces from its opening scene that its a movie where actors burst into choreographed song and dance routines on the spur of the moment this is a good thing part of the death of the musical involved the casting of actors who could not sing andor were wrong for the part naturally i was nervous about the casting gosling and stone are good actors as singers theyre effective her more so as a dancer gosling is a little clunky you get the feeling channing tatum might have done it better the plot echoes a 30s musical with dick powell and ruby keeler though not quite as artificial and stylized there are also elements of gene kelly including a 50s style ballet sequence plotwise a struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress are looking for a break in hollywood fall in love and struggle when they begin to find success the romance and much of the comedy echoes woody allens screenplays especially annie hall and his own musical everyone says i love you luckily the actors dont act as if theyre in an allen film no matter how much the script sounds like they should story and plot dont tend to matter much in a musical but the lead characters and the love story works the style and design are mostly spot on though its not a showcase of costume and sets the editing is a bit odd and sometimes it seems that the singing is not quite matching the lip movement when john legend sings though his songs are not good we hear what a polished singer sounds like and can clearly match his mouth to the sound none of the songs in the movie are breakout hits exactly emma stones audition song is the most effective andbut it heavily echoes paul williams i could hum rainbow connection over it overall despite criticism i think its a great movie for the present time it may succeed better as a gimmick given that this type of musical is so seldom made now in a year with multiple musicals im not sure how memorable this one would be i will say in almost all respects its well worth seeing and probably seeing in a theater for full effect,happy
this movie is beyond brilliant probably the best film the autistic reviewers jay and nick have seen this year the music is beautiful the editing was perfectly timed the direction was excellent the costume design was on the spot the cinematography was breath taking and the acting by emma stone and ryan goslingwow just wow we both saw emma stone in superbad and whoever wouldve thought she wouldve ended up here there is no doubt this film will be an oscar contender were hoping it will at least win an oscar for best original song for city of stars if you love musicals then see this movie it will possibly be the best one you ever take your kids take your parents and grandparentsyou will have the time of your life autistic reviewers give this 55 stars 1010,happy
heres a modern original take on the hollywood movie musical you remember when the stars broke into song and or dance its bright colorful and a treat for the visual and audio sensesthe director is going to get much of the credit for making this work emma stone gives an award worthy performance as the insecure girl wanting to live her dream maybe she stares into the distance a bit too ofteneverything about this production is outstanding the costumes the music even the poster is beautifulthe movie takes advantage of the big screen and should be enjoyed in a theater environment maybe audiences would have preferred the alternate ending that was cleverly presented no drugs sex or violence just a great time at the movies,happy
fourteen nominations six awards how sad i am to see this happen doesnt anyone know or remember why the musicals of yesteryear can still be seen today with the same enjoyment as they gave in the past im talking about the king and i  my fair lady mary poppins the sound of music kiss me kate singin in the rain and other greats could it be because the characters could actually sing ok rex was an exception but he owned his character if the actor couldnt sing they dubbed their voices the choreography was exciting and the actors could dance the script was strong the songs were memorable and still sung todays characters couldnt sing or dance the choreography was uninspiring and the music was bland the directing was all over the place the ending meant to be bittersweet was maudlin sadly it is true that mediocrity is todays genius,happy
this is the type of music film i should be all over loving it and wanting to watch it again and again i enjoy many of the old school hollywood music movies and many of the newer ones as well this film did nothing for me except make me check my watch over and over in movie time it felt like four hours to me songs felt shoe horned in and unimportant and even forgettable as an musician and artistic dreamer that has touched fame myself i should have connected with their dreams and goals and failures i didnt again just felt like it was cookiecuttered togetheri dont hate this film at all in fact it is well made the leads did great with their dance numbers even if ryan looked a little robotic by the numbers and the singing was too auto tuned still ive seen better much better and will not be watching this again just my opinionhaving recently watched 4 movies from the 50s60s era this felt like a pale imitation that wanted to pay respects to those style films but acted like cheap knock offs instead shocked it got all this praise and that others dont see right trough it like i did,happy
when i first saw the trailer for my expectations were set high the excellent cast the music and an exciting new directorwriter were enough to get me in the door is a triumph on so many levels it hooks you from the beginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart fluttering in the club at the end the film gets you with its charm it flows from the dialogue like poetry the chemistry between stone and gosling makes the film livelier stone has slowly shown herself as a force to be reckon with in hollywood and now gosling has join the ranks after his stellar performance as the jazz pianist whos main dream is watch jazz live on stone is a wanna be actress who cant find her way together they thrive off each others love and support as they try to accomplish their goals together each have a chance at their first oscar goldwhat else helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs i found myself humming city of stars all night long already saving the soundtrack on every music platform i could the music and dance numbers are a perfect blend of gene kelly musicals and more contemporary stuff like chicago the production design helps with this with bright vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building to emma stones dress a charming film only works when all cylinders click this one was clockworklike whiplash the editing is superb timing well with the score making it very appealing to the eye but the cinematography was mind blowing able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts made it very astonishing not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped each scene was extremely well thought out to cause the biggest awe effect or to provide strong symbolism but the ending is what can really make or break a movie this one makes it 10x better it goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop opening the audiences eyes to the entire meaning of the story beyond the theme of follow your dreams the idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them but life isnt your own everything does not end perfectlywhen combining all these elements together you get one of if not the best film of the year in a year where things became bitter this really ends the year on a high note cheers to the dreamers the men and women behind the making of this musical classic,happy
honestly when i was first told about the premise of i was pretty uninterested i love musicals and films of any genre but this one didnt peak my interest it was only after it was nominated for 14 oscars which is the same amount as my favorite film of all time titanic that i really noticed itand boy was i glad i did this movie is refreshing it puts to rest all the things about complex plots inappropriate material and language that so many movies have today and lets us take a twohour trip into the fantasy world of the story and its charactersthe songs were enjoyable with someone in the crowd being the standout the duets were emotional and i felt the connection the bright colors and eccentric dances added to the nostalgic feel of the story it did an exceptional job blending timeless musicals with modern traditionsi thought emma stone and ryan gosling did a great job at their parts with stone being the standout their characters felt real like someone you could really meet walking down the street their chemistry was good and i loved that this movie highlights the ups and downs of relationships because not every relationship is as flawless as the fairy tales sayi see some negative reviews about the singing and dancing being out of tune and not perfect but i think it adds to the story when the characters make a tiny wrong step or their voices shake it adds an extra element of realism that i dont think everyone sees i for one like the tiny mistakes that you can point out no one is truly flawless i think the only thing i didnt like was the pacing it was a bit slow but its understandable considering you wouldnt add a car chase or some action sequence to a romance musical i also think it couldve used one more group song like the first two in the film but overall its a clean movie that will give you a roller coaster of emotions and leave you with melodies and tunes playing in your head all night a must see for anyone who loves musicals,happy
good cinematography bad musical i am a person with non biases and i will say although the plot and music was terrible it had great cinematography the longshots were great brings life to the scene but this movie lacked the real stuff that cinematography will no make upbad musical1 song the entire show over and over and over and over everything was so bad there was no build to any plot everything just happens these actors cant sing cant dance sorta the point of a musicalgive emma and ryan credit though they tried their best its the fault of the producers who casted themand in the end they use the cheap trick what if my life was with you whats awful is this trick works on the majority of the people they feel this emotion like what if this feeling and walk out thinking wow that movie really made me sad it must be a good movieseriously capitalism has destroyed another art form this film was made non other than for profit i see no passion in the art of musical itself at all even though mentioned many times in the film that passion is what drives others to enjoy please if you truly enjoy musical dont waste your time watching this if you just want to see your favorite actoractress with some super screen time go for it for those who wants to watch musicals well sadly passion is not the drive for movie makers today profit is,happy
although this movie is probably about pursuing ones dreams and sacrifices necessary in the process it ended up as a lousy musical with good music its also dedicated to some golden era in hollywood when musical was the best there is in the industry so instead of a clear emotional story of two star crossed lovers weve got collision of dreams of two egoists who think their individual success is more important than than anything else it isnt its just that could not reconcile one type of emotion craving for fame with another love direction is not bad however not as good as in whiplash and everything has been watered down with two miscast main actors who cannot sing and acting itself is also doubtful ending of the story was predictable and probably many hollywood staff would recognize itself here as for the musical unfortunately i liked only sweeny todd meaning that it could not function in any other form summary worth a look but soon to be forgotten despite the hype four stars for cinematography,happy
a fantastically fun opening number and a pathos fueled final montage just cant save a staid script mostly uninspired musical numbers and good acting but thin performing from the leads i was far more bored than charmed all and all its nicely photographed but overcolored in some desperate need to be dreamy artificial and plastic too many super hot reds gobble up visual information instead of actually lighting the leads and the sets to its credit its ambitious as hell wellintentioned and a bit of a production triumph i appreciate many of the handbuilt sets but as an experience it mostly fell flat for me i know im in the minority here which is totally fine its just a movie from the disgusting display of opinion bashing in the comments section youd think this was politics or something but personally i wouldve rather rewatched singing in the rain,happy
i can only give lala land a 6 with all the hype i really thought i would be more entertained the story has been told so many times the dance scenes are fun  not quite old hollywood but close the special affects were fun  like the dancing in the stars  actually quite beautiful even though you can tell how they did it very little dialogue and that was ok but it was missing something to me  cannot quite put my finger on it the colorful costumes were fun the music was good but i do not think i will be humming any song tomorrow john legend was good  and he did write some good songs for the movie so to me it was an interesting movie and if the oscars had a musical best movie award  it would probably get it since there is little competition i do not see it as a best movie for 2016 i do not think i will be thinking of this film in the next week and to me when i am still thinking of it later then it has stirred something in me to make it memorable i know it took a long time to get this film made and i respect the diligence of the director to do that but it just did not do it for me sorry i think i may be in the minority but that is my opinion,happy

its a shame that this film directed by the very talented damien chazelle creator of whiplash has had so much praise heaped on it and is favourite for the oscars it is not a bad film but it doesnt deserve an oscar when it ended i left the cinema saying it doesnt suck and i didnt walk out on it but i didnt rave about it with echoes of whiplash it does have deeper themes such as how two artists in a relationship can maintain their careers simultaneously and also the importance of dreaming big and of being willing to fail and compromise also it must be noted this films creators have dreamed big  by bringing a big time musical back to a hollywood studio film but maybe thats all the risk they were prepared to take because much of the film is quite bland the opening number on the jammedup freeway is an excellent idea but all we see dancing and singing are beautiful thin young people in multicoloured clothes fresh from the studio wardrobe it would have been so much fresher to have old people and obese people and kids getting out of those cars and doing their own thing but for many of the films scenes we only get lithe young dancers in swimsuits or dancing clothes shaking their booty its boring or rather its nice but not exciting i feel emma stone and ryan gosling are sincere in their roles as the struggling actor mia and the earnest jazz pianist sebastian but they come across as very well pleasant ie bland they have no edge theyre not quirky theyre very waspish the films soundtrack is nicely performed but not that memorable if you look at a musical like chicago or hairspray there are about 10 killer songs that stay with you not with i like how showcases some lesserknown los angeles landmarks but the movie is also too conservative in sticking to a very rigid style there are some tiny nods to modern times such as mia driving herself home from a date and a cellphone ring getting in the way of romance but lots of other films such as chef which uses twitter or baz luhrmanns romeo  juliet with its druggang take on a modern city and even the semianimated enchanted set in tough new york are willing to have fun with modern technology even while they portray traditional stories and styles gosling and stone are very serious and earnest i feel theyre wrong for these roles tries hard but ultimately i didnt love it i wanted to but i didnt,happy
is a dazzling cinematic explosion made up of life love and music its a magical musical ride through an unforgettable romance that is original and brilliant after directing whiplash and now this it is obvious that director damien chazelle will live on to become one of the greats as a matter of fact this might be even better than whiplash and it seems like it will certainly become a cinematic classic over time although the film drips with a sense of homage it still does not contain an ounce of clich which is a real relief reading the synopsis it may seem like an average love story but it manages to be unpredictable the depiction of the conflicts that arise during a relationship is reminiscent to jean vigos masterful classic latalante and this film deserves to be compared to such masterpieces because it is a masterpiece it is not only a masterpiece of cinema but also of entertainment music humor and drama it is an experience that will likely be appreciated by alleveryone from high brow critics to young girls,happy
ive got just one word for it magical 2016 has given us some amazing movies and this one is definitely in the top 5with the most beautiful soundtrack and two of the best actors this movie just casts a spell on youryan gosling and emma stone have amazing chemistry and ive loved their pairing since ive seen crazy stupid love the soundtrack is enchanting justin hurwitz delivers the most memorable tunes of the year city of stars being my personal favourite mia and sebastians theme and the fools who dream vocals by emma stone standoutafter delivering whiplash i certainly expected a lot out of damien chazelle and he doesnt disappoint one bitcan be deemed as one of the greatest musical of this generation and the most romantic movie of 2016 go and give into the magic you wont be disappointed,happy
here we are january 2017 barely one month is past and we already have the worst movie of the year beside the sorry lack of continuity poor lighting and average acting will put to sleep in la la anyone who likes this genre except for the very loud progressive jazz the person who recommended this movie to me will suffer accordingly no promotion or raise for the foreseeable future and will be made to pay back the money i spent for the tickets my wife and another couple do i have anything good to say about it nahhh i just wonder how in heavens earth this trash got even one oscar nomination unless they have a category for boredom inducing relevant script on two hours of celluloid the producers must have had no budget for lighting equipment the movie is as dark as third rate horror trilogy talk about a spoiler  here is one  i spoiled 2 hours trying to stay awake with some success and imdb shows 83 rating is this another case of alternate reality save your money for a good movie,happy
i have never written a review before on imdb although i have had an account here for ages but today was the day i finally decided a review for this magical movie is a must it has been almost 8 hours since i saw the movie but the last scene the last image the last piano note is so fresh in my mind i keep going in and out of a state of trance where the movies main theme plays on repeat in my head which elevates my emotions onto the next level the movie is pure nirvana i dont quite think i have witnessed anything this magical in this era please go and watch it take your loved one with you hold their hand and dream away like the fools of this mesmerising story i guarantee you will not be disappointed,happy
i dont usually write reviews but just cant let this pass i am not really qualified to review this because truthfully i could only watch a little over 30 minutes of this hopeless mess but here are my 30 minutes impressions a musical with two stars who neither sing dance or have charisma and are not really physically attractive unforgettable music an opening musical number that is been there seen that what most impressed me was how the car hoods buckled under the weight of the dancersps i love good movie and stage musicals having worked half my life in them,happy
dear hollywood i was looking forward to seeing with my sisters we went and were enjoying the movie hence the 6 rating then the ending we all want a happy ending its make believe its hopeful it makes us leave the theater singing and laughing and dancing just like when we saw singing in the rain when a movie starts out with everyone singing and dancing for no reason some complaints about this but i liked it its fun and uplifting the two main characters were great together on screen the story line was easy to follow and it flowed without dragging too long on any one part unless a movie is based on a real life story   we want a happy ending dear hollywood please give us a happy ending on movies like this thank you,happy
at first i thought oh my what if i dont like this movie im not that into musicals and the begging welcomes you with a song but as the movie develops i could get comfortable with it i loved the shots taken while dancing and singing most of the time but maybe there are some flaws such as the scene of mias audition where she seems like floating in the black background making it look funny i also loved the direction in which they choose to represent life how it is it is not a happy ending story although we can get a glance at the alternative ending where mia and sebastian live together the work between emma and ryan is wonderful theyve work before reason that assures that the connection feels real for the audience despite their first approaches are hostile in the movie they develop very well their characters relationship and all their work for dance piano and singing scenes were worth itit is very sad to see reviews with an 110 score this movie doesnt deserve such a poor score it has an amazing soundtrack yes i would love more songs but it is not that relevant there are not many movies such as this one nowadays people prefer watching two hours of action spectacle without experiencing any kind of feelingi do not say you need to love it but it is a mustwatch,happy
just saw the movie  thoroughly enjoyed it wish i had waited for the video i have always liked emma stone but feel she was miscast for this role not a strong musical voice but as this is maybe half a musical she survived the endeavorthe story line worked but i feel it should have had a little more money thrown at it  extended the time frame for a far better ending could have been achieved the music score when there was one was very enjoyable  when a surprise artist made his intro  your introduced to jazz fusion it saves the movie from being a total flop and makes a memorable scene to bad there were not more all in all a watchable flick once this is not a moulin rouge or phantom trust me wait for the video sorry,happy
one of my favourite movies and favourite musicals first of all you should not compare it with classical musicals they are great on there on place is a kind of modern musical which is still revolved around some of the old school techniques its a great movie greatly written greatly acted and greatly executed the musicals scores are the best part of it other than that the movie is unique its not the kind of movie youve already seen dont hear what the people have to say about it be your own judge and give it a try,happy
is a classic musical disguised as a new movie both gosling and stone give amazing performances and you believe their chemistry so much that it angered me when they didnt get together at the end also the music is a amazing overall if you havent seen yet i highly recommend it any musical fan or movie fan in general will adore this movie as i did,happy
this movie is boring and i dont understand how it could have won awards and gotten the praise it received the songs are nothing great its not funny all it is a story of how a struggling actress and musician finally get success after they break up whats good about that the ending doesnt make much sense i guess it shows how mias is thinking her life would have been different if they didnt break upfinal verdict dont waste money on this,happy
i really dont know what the big fuss was about this film admittedly it was beautifully shot and produced the music and little dance numbers were brilliant and it was visually stunning the whole thing reminded me of a chagall painting i would say that was my favourite thing about the movie its all very romantic looking and stylish however these things were all smoke and mirrors to me to hide the fact that the story was shallow and pretentious it just wasnt all that interesting and couldnt hold my attention is it just me or do emma stone and ryan gosling just seem to play the same people in every one of their movies i feel like theyre the same no matter what roles they play its the same with ryan reynolds as though their acting spectrum is very limited so they cant take on a wide variety of diverse roles in a nutshell beautifully made and visually striking but rather uninteresting story and uninspired acting totally not deserving of all the oscars,happy
this movie appealed to the hollywood screenwriters and actors because it was about them not because it was a good movie it was disjointed and i can only imagine the producers and writers cheering themselves on and saying how they did a great job and the outoftouch academy saying this is brilliant it was very disappointing because we do need more well written musicals but this one was not and was such a waste of time i will not argue however that emma stone is a very good actress,happy
sorry thats all there is to it this movie was horrendous sebastian ryan gosling is the reason she became famous he made her and what does he get in the end a broken heart because hey why not make the good guy lose gtfo with that bs,happy
i watched it because it was so hyped up but personally it felt like a waste of timeit had cool shots though which is why i kept watching till the end 1010 for cinematography but i really dont know why it got nominated for an oscar the story was mediocre at best,happy
i had such high hopes for this movie i love musicals but it was so very boring not sure why had nice sets good effects good dancing but the plot seemed disjointed and i was underwhelmed by the musical numbersall in all lackluster,happy
as someone for which musicals are not all that entertaining i can say that i thoroughly loved grease and west side story i cannot say the same for the music is repetitive in and quickly loses its charm the acting is great ill give it that but the story has no place being called a good one it follows the formula of a love story meeting honeymoon trials and eventual reunion but fails at a flowing plot the jump cuts with the season name is lazy at best and feels to be a lazy scenery change the plot events dont even do anything to hide that and the music is utterly monotonous clearly it is meant to be slow emotional but tracks like city of stars consist only of a few chords and fail to develop beyond that the melodies are repetitive as well as the dance sequences being mediocre at best for someone who enjoys classical music and jazz too it is odd how this movie would have put me to sleep,happy
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen and i dont know how did it get 6 oscars i gave it one star because there wasnt an option to give it a zero  or less it was an absolute waste of time and money i wouldnt advice you to watch it instead go watch the simpsons or something less boring,happy
by seeing the trailer and the promising reviews of the film i expected to see a visual spectacle i knew i could not expect a film that would make me think or would change my views on life if it did it would be a pleasant surprise otherwise it would be purely very entertaining to my disappointment it wasnt both of them the story of the film is really not interesting to keep watching i was quite bored by its obvious and noncreative plot line my last hope was a surprising plottwist but unfortunately this didnt happen either the plot was straightforward and meaningless this made me think about where the high rates would come from was it the visuals i think this was the best part of the film though it wasnt that impressive that it made up for the boring plot the acting wasnt that good either why were ryan gosling and emma stone chosen for this film i suppose only for the big names i would rather have seen actual musical stars with more entertainment experience i dont think gosling and stone have a very convincing chemistry which made the film not very romantic even though i watched it on christmas eve with my boyfriend but i dont know how much i can blame their performance on themselves the dialogues just werent very strongly written there was no excitement or actual drama everything remained flat and made you not care about the characters at all on top of that the characters were already too cool and flawless from the beginning of the film so there wasnt too much character development in the end i still give the film a 7 because it was still a bit entertaining to watch the visuals and locations were nice and the editing was quite good for me this was an average film watching experience,happy
this is a dream its conflict its compromise and its very very exciting heres to the ones who dream is a true definition of cinema heres my thoughts about this magical movieim in love like really in love with this movie because is a movie which has reinforced my belief in the power of dreams the first five minutes is like a great appetizer before you get the better main course one shot dude come on gosling performance is ridiculously good but stone has never been better like this before the audition scene god chazelles direction is a gift for cinema he know how to treat a scene and end a movie whiplash remember thank god hes not one hit wonder director justin hurwitz needs to get more recognition his work is a fine art and i think people will always talk about the music of the shots and coloring is a masterwork and a feast for your eyes bow down to linus sandgren and natasha leonnet the final 15 minutes and the epilogue scene is breathtaking yes i cried my soul left my body during this sequence because hit me on so many levels its so beautiful and charming and emotionalits a love letter for people like me who adore everything about cinema jazz hollywood stunning visual los angeles musical and dreamers made me nostalgic and yearn about something ive never experienced before and i want it more than ever after watch this movie recommended to everyone who give up to pursue passion for the arts because this movie celebrate the dreamers among us except the pessimistic and cynical ones bittersweet brilliance an instant classic an homage to the classic era of hollywood musical and 2016 antidote for surei cant remember the last time a movie made me feel this way deepest thanks to all who created especially for chazelle and hurwitz for this ambitious project i love you bothi can talk about this movie all day long seriously please do watch this one in theater i will drag everyone i know to watch this blissful magical movie i cant recommend it enough last thing to say if you dont enjoy probably you dont deserve to be happy,happy
its very obvious that this movie is made with the utmost passion for both films and music i found this movie to be enthralling and perfect i cannot specify how much i loved this movie did i mention that i loved this movie well i do unlike a lot of people i talk to i have no problems with musicals and i quite like them im going to make this short and sweet and try to list all the perfect things about this moviesince its a musical i feel i should mention that the songs singing and dancing were absolutely flawless in execution i especially adored fools who dream i am a huge fan of both leads and in my opinion this was a career best performance by the gorgeous emma stone and another brilliant performance by gostling their chemistry was 100 believable and they were very cute togetherthe plot itself focuses a lot on passion and dedication to that passion it tries to make people want to achieve their goals and follow their dreams in an active waydirecting and cinematography were absolutely beautiful i was born in la so this movie made me very nostalgic and it showed the sort of artistic side of la and i loved itit is a gripping experience but i would recommend watching this with a significant other 1110,happy
ive always been a fan not just of fine acting in a movie but of well written movie as well in both instances does not disappoint from the opening scene to the end credits is one of the most thought provoking emotionally fulfilling and romantic films in recent memory the pacing is perfect the acting and writing so good that the movie seemed a lot shorter than its actual runtime around two hours yes its that goodits funny too because jazz is one of my least favorite musical genres however this did not adversely affect my enjoyment of the film one bit it was simply sebastians passion ryan gosling as mias emma stonewas acting this film has won many awards and deservedly so its not by accident that the scores on imdb rotton tomatoes and metacritic are off the charts i understand that universal acclaim does not guarantee that one will enjoy this film as i myself have seen films in the past that were wildly popular that i did not enjoy as much as the majority but the fact of this films success should grab your attention at leasti guess what it comes down to is whether you like musicals with original songs that are actually memorable long after the movies over or whether you enjoy an intelligent movie thats well written and executed to near perfection or if you enjoy the work of emma stone or ryan gosling because if you like all or only some of the above things than your almost assuredly going to enjoy,happy
yes is a perfect movie and its destined to be a classic in my opinion i went to see it last night and i had to go back today because i kept thinking about it and humming the songs this is a perfectly crafted film i have only have positive things to say about the movie i needed all year long just by watching the trailers i could smell something special with the amazing cinematography and the beautiful music no need to say the movie exceeded my expectations the casting of emma stone and ryan gosling is simply genius i heard rumours that they initially had miles teller in mind for this movie but it wouldnt have been the same without goslingstone this is the third movie with them together as the leads with the underrated crazy stupid love and the disappointing gangster squad you can tell they were made for this musical even though ryan gosling is not a natural born singer the performance and the dance numbers wouldnt have been the same without their chemistry pretty sure emma stone is a lock for best actressobviously the production design and the visuals are breathtaking this is a movie im going to watch over and over again for the musical numbers most of the times it feels like you are watching a dream and i think this is exactly what chazelle was aiming for he succeeded at every level the synergy between the music the colours the camerawork the editing the costumes and of course goslingstone made this experience incredibly unique there is also a lot of layers to the story was essential to bring those numbers alive without spoiling anything the ending was beautifuli was not a fan of les misrables and chicago but singin in the rain and the sound of music are the best musicals ever made deserves a place among them of course we will give the movie some time to breathe but to me this already is a classic theres so many things i have to say but i will let the smarter people talk about it its funny engaging beautiful dont miss it1010,happy
there hasnt been a great musical in my opinion in almost 30 years but damien chazelle delivers an absolute masterpiece of a musical with gets back to the basics of why we love musicals as feels like singin in the rain west side story silk stockings the band wagon carousel and so many other musicals which we all love and cherish is unique though as it has its own voice on how life really goesalso never has their been an opening scene where people are dancing on cars in a long shot something so new and innovative in musicals an amazing shot life is not always peaches and cream as this is a musical which will make you smile smile so much and it will make you cry for joy and it will make you sad at the end because we dont always get what we want in life as so cleverly demonstrates shows the truth about how auditions go sometimes and it gives the viewer a first hand look at how difficult it can be for two people to date in the entertainment industry as why you see some actresses in real life date men outside of the entertainment industry and vice versa ryan gosling and emma stones chemistry is so beautiful you smile laugh and cry every time you see them together in this film it reminds you of a rogersastaire dynamic the stuff dreams are made of its been sososo long since there has been chemistry this good in a musical emma stone has shown the audience what a great actress she is and that she is here to stay gosling is gosling hes always great you cant go wrong with the gosling i really get the feeling this film is going to win best picture this year at the oscars and it will be between amy adams and emma stone for best actress is a mustmust see film go see it as soon as you can you will fall in love with musicals all over again,happy
i waited for the dvd and now i want to sell it this musical was so boring it is not a cinematic treasure or sundrenched masterpiece it is boring the story is not a story really just boring besides the lack of a story the characters are boring i like ryan gosling and emma stone in other roles but they were clearly out of their element in this musical simple fact they cannot sing or dance wtf plus the dance scenes are so pitiful so short and so few it is a wonder they were featured in commercials did the two even try to learn to dance and sing i long for the days of the musical film chicago with catherine zetajones and renee zellweger catherine is a singer and dancer but renee wasnt but she learned and she did a good job even richard gere was a great pick for that film hollywood needs to find that casting director and hire them for the next musical,happy
first of all this movie is not a complete musical there is a lot of singing and dancing but the movie has a lot of normal dialog as well the opening scene is very neat and is basically one long shot that takes place on the la freeway with everybody singing and dancing it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie thoughi liked how the opening also had the filmed in cinemascope at the beginning that gave you that old school feeling right away there were many great locations in the movie that make you want to travel to la and just hang out in jazz clubs speaking of jazz clubs i really liked how jk simmons had a small role at the jazz club considering he played a jazz instructor in whiplash i really love the chemistry between mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling it was such a nod to the old hollywood classics emma is such a wonderful actress and captivating on screen she will probably be playing great roles for many years to come the ending was actually very very well done and had a bittersweet twist to it finally at the very end they show the words the end which also bring back great memories of movie watching days gone by,happy
after seeing this movie and reading the reviews one can only assume that their are two very different types of audiences out there one truly is from and the other is scratching their collective heads wondering what the lalaers have been smoking 10 seconds in you should know if you are the fly enamored with the bright light or if you are the observer wondering why the fly is so easily amused,happy
unusually for me i actually had good expectations going in to this movie ive always loved the classic musicals of fred astaire and ginger rogers and to see such a film as hit theatres in this day and age felt like some sort of revival of the long dead musical genre but the big question is is there anything under the surface is it just a fun musical with great songs or is there more than just thatwell its with deep pleasure that i can in fact say it isnt just a musical  if anything its a good story first a great musical secondyes i went in expecting a good musical and to be honest if all it was was that i would have no complaints but this movie took it another level it had an extra layer that i wasnt expectingi enjoyed 2017s beauty and the beast remake a lot it delivered with great songs and brilliant dance choreography but lets be honest  if you take all that away what would you have it wouldnt be half the movie it was without the musical side of thingstake and you have a movie that would work fine even if you took the musical side of things away the songs only make it even greater than it would have already have beenthe chemistry between the two leads feels genuine and believable they dont feel like fictional characters instead they feel like real human beings with real aspirations and real dreams hoping to prove their worth as someone with big dreams of hitting it big this undoubtedly hit to heart with meive heard some backlash from some people who want to get over critical due to the movies massive success some say its nothing but an excuse for hollywood to glorify themselves with much narcissism those people completely misunderstood the whole point of this movie this is a raw portrayal of hollywood and the challenge one has to achieve successthe ending  i dare not spoil it it is the very cherry on top of a delicious cakei tell you if you have not watched believe the hype its as good as they say it is,happy
if i had just one word to describe the movie it would be just mehdefinitely not an oscar win for the actors i have to mention that emma stone really bothered me throughout the movie i dont know if it is her eyebrows or what but that was the biggest error gosling was fine he pulled off those little comic reliefs if you watch the movie simply for entertainment i guarantee you will end up sleeping i watched it at the theaters and hell if i watched it anywhere else thats directly dreamland for sure and the music is nice so that encourages that even more theres nothing really special to the script and story line just little heartbreaks and awes but nothing much i literally could expect what would happen and the parts where i am supposed to feel sentimental all this hype about this movie astounds me i guess we were really craving for a prevalent romance movie for a while gotta say the visual of the overall screenplay is good the music is nice too definitely not a fan of the boring story line and stone,happy
whos packing up their life and spending their last dime to head to the dying dream of hollywood anymore this perverse recruitment film for the starstruck wannabe starlet was so far from the magic that once was there truly seems no way back from the travesty that has become the movie industry reminiscent of hacked together b movies that flood the foreign market with the western themed algorithm cute boy meets cute girl check personal conflict and trite inner turmoil check struggle for success check romantic poverty check dream achieved but heartbroken check if only things had been different check tear smile end scene check checkwhen will casting directors ever learn dont cast a big name just for the name especially for the small niche that is musical talent in hollywood today the singing was difficult to listen to at times and the dancing i i just dont have the words do yourself a favor and watch crazy stupid love instead at least you get steve carell and some laughs,happy
whats the big deal with i dont know narsissistic hollywood nominating it for 16 billions oscars i sort of get that is all about the good old boring times but what about all the other critics why do they love it so much strange could it be that no one dares to say they thought it was kind of meh possiblyok so is well directed its well made everything is nice and ok technically its pretty good but thats it the songs are really nothing special the acting is nothing special the dancing is nothing special the story nothing special not much at all really see where im going with this is nothing special it has nothing new i dont really mind it not having anything new but other critics always seem to so why dont they think it matters with and no its not one of those times where the direction is so good that we dont need a story not at allthese characters are so flat and boring oh my god emma stones character wants to be an actress ryan goslings character is a jazz pianist thats it they have absolutely no other qualities they are the most boring people ive seen in a movie for quite some time and its nothing more to say about them they are snoreand the piano theme they beat us over the head with yes yes its nostalgic and nice but come on over and over and over and over and over and over and overi think in a couple of years people will have forgotten why they supposedly loved this movie so much and it will more or less get lost in history its hype people a lot of hype its not bad but 14 oscarnom worthy hell no,happy
i saw this movie on a double date with my best friend and these two guys that we didntdont know very well it was pouring rain there was nothing better to do and no one wanted to see the byebye man so this is what we saw theres a part where mia stone shows sebastian gosling her play for the first time and asks him if its too nostalgic thats the point sebastian says and i think thats kind of the point of this filmwhatever town they showed in this movie was not not not los angeles california i grew up about four hours north of la i went there every summer the la in is a mistyeyed nostalgic reinterpretation of the actual city theres nothing wrong with that but the movie tries way too hard its practically slapping you in the face with a giant nostalgia stick screaming look at me  im sweet and poetic and nostalgic granted there are some moments when pulled it off the party where mia and sebastian meet after he blows her off at that restaurant and they go out and look over the city  that scene was tasteful and i forgot what i was watching but then it just dived right back into its glossy sweetness and i started internally screaming againi will give it credit for the whole style of the movie the directing and sets and visual effects were stunning and new they deserve all the awards stone and gosling were fabulous actors in the roles they were givenbut the story and the tone are where it all falls apart the plot left me angry at the characters and the tone of the movie was so sweet it gave me cavitiesthe tone is a loud call for simpler times when old stars like taylor and kelly and monroe and hepburn graced the screens again  there is nothing wrong with that but the way this movie did it was so sickeningly sugary sweet that it made my head hurti think the problem is that it was set in modern day la you cant portray modern day la without showing some of the grit and dirty underhandedness and modern surge of technology and ideas people trying to oppose my point will say that the movie did show this through the whole sebastian being ripped off by keith john legend and being forced to give up his art in that weird electrojazz band but even that didnt quite do justice to the harsh realities of la it was all sugar coated in dreams and songs and tap dancing and emma stones goofy smileone of my favorite scenes was when mia and sebastian went to the movie and the observatory when she ditched that greg guy i was like yes yes yes you go get ryan gosling during the whole hand holding thing my date looked at me like he wanted to do the same and i kind of had to hide my hands under my legs but hey mia and sebastian made it workand the ending  oh the ending made my heart ache if youre like me and read reviews marked spoiler even if you havent seen the film i wont give it away but the ending made my heart hurt in the best kind of way i kind of want to give it 0 stars just because the ending made me so sad but sad doesnt necessarily equal bad actually i gave the movie a higher rating just because it takes one heck of a movie to make me feel some type of wayoverall it was okay there were moments where i was grinning and laughing and cheering and there were moments where i wanted to go bash my head against a wall 50 great moments  50 cheesyterrible moments averages out to an okay moviego see it or dont i feel like this is one of those movies where people either hated it or they loved it as for me i saw it less than an hour ago im honestly still trying to decide,happy
im not big on musicals but something about interested me to go and see it i do admire ryan goslings previous work so that could have been it alongside the idea of making an old fashioned musical in the modern world i found interesting the musical numbers are very good but they are not as spectacular as i imagined they were going to be and not as spectacular as what i have seen in old hollywood movies however on reflection i dont think it is trying to be the dance scenes go for emotion rather than spectacleother than that it was a really simple story well told the look of the film is gorgeous its set in la but its an la that doesnt really exist except in the movies its a film designed to simply entertain and take you away for a couple of hours and i must admit it does that very well gosling and stone have enough chemistry to carry the simple plot throughout and there are funny moments romantic moments and sad moments the seasonal changes gave me an inkling from the start as to where the film was going in terms of the ending but i did eventually like the way it didnt end too sugar coated one big drawback however will be the endless poor imitators that will come along on the back of it,happy
saw this yesterday did not know what to expect drama and romance  well why not im a bit bored of all those superhero space adventure remakes they push nowadayssurprise i was a bit scared when it became obvious its a musical i dont like many musicals well luckily it was not a typical american musical but just a song here and there still some of the songs felt they were just plastered over the storywhat was american however was how it was filmed a lot of static camera with big faces on the screen not very ambitious but at least they avoided unnecessary trickery a few exceptions and traditional cuts played nicely along the storyi loved the colorsthe story is a bit thin i felt a there wasnt that much chemistry between the characters but perhaps that was exactly the point and it was light at the same time not very dramatic after all refreshingsinging and music sounded real and not too perfect  which was perfect after all sadly there isnt any jazz clubs in this town id be sitting there very very often perhaps i should set up one myselfi can see they tried to copy the vibe of some classic movies but unfortunately fell a bit short quite far at the same time,happy
i dont understand the high praise for this movie yes ryan gosling and emma stone are both charismatic actors and enjoyable to watch but even they are not able to move the film above average plus i felt like i was watching a fairly good woody allen film that kept getting interrupted by musical numbers one of my pet peeves with musicals is when the music comes in without any reason other then to have a musical number at that moment music in the best of musicals should further the story  not stop it mid stream i was really disappointed as the hype had led me to expect a truly groundbreaking return to the hollywood musical it isnt,happy
absolutely one of the best movies ive ever seen if you like jazz see it if you like romance see it if you like crying at the end of movies see it just plain see it ryan gosling and emma stone are fantastic the music is fantastic and i was never bored i even bought the soundtrack right after seeing which ive done maybe two or three times in my life fun fact ryan learned piano just for this movie and all scenes of him playing are real some people may find it moves slow at times the friend i saw it with said as much but personally i wasnt in addition the end seemed a little padded but was still fantastic frankly more movies like this need to be made this is exactly the kind of thing hollywood needs to revitalize cinema in our current world of remakes and uninspired reboots,happy
ive seen quite a few movies especially the ones that appear each year in award nominations so i feel like i have a decent perspective i remember whiplash and loved it and when i saw that this film was from the same creator i got excited after i watched the trailer months ago i shared with probably everyone i waited months for it to finally make it to theaters i saw it right after christmas and i had high expectations and was a little worried that wasnt going to meet them but forget that exceeded those far and away im not a movie critic so i wont try to use the fancy and eloquent review style of writing ill just tell it like it is this movie is the most beautiful thing ive seen on screen and quite possibly the most beautiful piece of performance art ive ever seen too its beautifully shot the music is incredibly addictive and full of emotion the story is timeless and the acting especially from the leads is absolutely outstanding thank god these two ended up in these roles because the chemistry and character of the two is simply perfect takes you on an incredible rollercoaster thats beautiful in every way technically the film is a musical but dont let that turn you off if thats not your thing it makes the story twice as good there arent too many musical numbers and each of them is incredible as well as important to the story i love musicals so that probably helped but the point is youre going to love this one you fall in love with the characters with the music with the story and this movie will affect you each of us can relate to and the film makes me want more out of life but at the same time it gives an incredible experience just watching it happen,happy
simply dazzling a beautifully produced motion picture musical that is sure to delight audiences around the world ryan gosling sebastian and emma stone mia shine brightly in this self reflexive modern romantic film set on the backdrop of a classically composed movie musical echoing the song and dance numbers that busby berkeley brought to the silver screen through hollywood studio system powerhouse

artist in the visual and performing artsor just an artist in generalneeds to watch this film if you have ever been discouraged on your career path or lack thereof this film will aid in reigniting the flame that fuels your dreams of writing acting playing or whatever your passion happens to be whereas many films similar to this one would have shot it as a period or modern piece this film is nothing short of a masterpiece that harnesses the nostalgic appeal of the classic musical with the power of modern cinematic storytellingbest part about damien chazelles the oldschool movie musical feel from the moment the film opens from set pieces to matte paintings to the manner in which the cameras capture the story as the drama unfolds this is both a modern story of romance and conflict and classic hollywood musical while some may find the cinematography lighting and editing to be nothing remarkable the fact of the matter is that it required great skill and hundreds of hours of effort to capture the essence of an old hollywood musical to recreate a nearly extinct film genre is an outstanding achievement in cinematic storytelling and deserves all the 9s and 10s this film is receiving from critics and fans alike takes pages right out of the books of busby berkeley footlight parade and gene kelly singin in the rain such a gorgeous combination of a classically structured and choreographed musical within a modern hollywood and the film could have easily rested its laurels on the technical and artistic achievements alone but the film also possesses an incredibly beautiful love story between two aspiring artistsin a modern studio system who appears all too often to be more concerned with franchise building merchandising theme park integration and rebooting this film is fresh real gritty and endearing in a climate so predisposed to the star warses harry potters jurassic parks and avengerses this film brings with is a breath of fresh air that is nearly unmatched by any other film this year while many are concerned with the lack of original stories coming out of hollywood may this film be a testament that masterpieces can still make their way into cinemas nationwide and not simply the art house theatre of the us largest metro areas although film is a visual medium and should not rely upon the score or songs to carry the bulk of the film ie frozen this film is very much about the music however unlike films that integrate music in order to cover up poorly structured and developed writing embraces the music as much a part of the story as the writing itself in many ways the film plays out like music and flows like a musical score the way the cameras moves the editor cut and the blocking of the characters is very much like a musical staff like the way music is composed and performed but at the same time the movie is not simply about the music but about the relationship between mia and sebastian and furthermore about their aspirations for the spotlight solid writing and a solid scorethe casting of could not have been more brilliant both stone and gosling successfully bring about that 1940s feel in a modern story that could be due to the successes of both in 1940s era films prior stone in magic in the moonlight and gosling in the notebook while both can successfully carry a period piece on their own respectively together they are a powerhouse couple like fred astaire and ginger rogers their performances in this film were so incredibly natural no real and believable at the same time the actors are also very much contemporaryjust like the film classic yet contemporary even though the audience is well aware that stone and gosling are anything but struggling artists they play their respective parts so convincingly that youd swear that we were actually watching a pair of struggling artists who do desperately want a substantive piece of that hollywood pie a great screenplay possesses protagonists that the audience will love or love to hate and the characters in connect so incredibly well with classic and contemporary audiences inspirational this film will help to inspire those who have a talent for storytelling music or writing to continue to work hard and remain dedicated to ones craft because that is the only way that a career can pay off the moment you stop trying is the moment that the dream dies along with settling for less not that dayjobs arent important certainly the importance of a day job is shown in the film but its imperative that the day job never cause an artist to sell out or give up on the dream day jobs should fund imaginative dreams not eclipse them there is much to love about this film so much so that you will likely find yourself with a desire to watch it again this is definitely my pick for best picture as we head into award season with the holidays coming to a close,happy
this is one of the best movies i have seen in my 62 years how often do you hear a theater audience burst into applause in the first 5 minutes from the spectacular opening of the film you realize that you arent in kansas anymore anything can and does happen in the story involves a young aspiring actress emma stone who meets a jazz pianist ryan gosling who is determined to open a jazz club it should be noted that gosling actually did his own piano playing in the film but it is emma stone who steals the show here with fabulous singing dancing and acting emma just graduated to the great actresses club with this performancethe relationship between the actress and pianist has its ups and downs as they seek their dreams there are moments so beautiful that i wept for joy i may have to watch this movie many times it is pure blissthis movie is hard to describe because it has charming oldfashioned elements yet it is at the same time supermodern but above all it has a mountain of talent a great deal of intelligence and a beautiful heart you will love it,happy
this is a stunning beautiful film that stars emma stone as an aspiring actress in los angeles that falls for a young jazz pianist played by ryan gosling they dance and sing around la hot spots and it is magnificent to watch especially a tap dance number they do in front of a los angeles sunset so many of the musical numbers are so well choreographed and beautifully done the acting is terrific emma stone is magnificent it feels like her story when she was young struggling to try and make it as an actress and really trying her best to become a staryou can feel her struggle to succeed also gosling has a real love for jazz and feels that is dieing and wants open his own jazz club this film has feelings of nostalgia and a dreamer quality of wanting to succeed in the arts and doing what it takes to follow your passion the film is beautifully directed by damian chazelle who also did the awesome whiplash which i loved the music was great every scene had me just smiling the whole way through la looks beautiful in this film this is the best film of the year and will win best picture at the oscars 5 stars,happy
this may be the best movie ive ever seen it brilliantly uses the trappings of 1940s and 50s moviemusicals to make something entirely unique i have only seen a few of those movie musicals but this made me want to watch all of them the movie uses a fairly unique form of nostalgia so that those who love the old movies want to watch them but those who dont know the old movies want to track them down i saw it with a friend who while he likes stage shows hates movie musicals and he loved it usually movie musicals feel like the directors are trying to decompress a stage show with most of the energy of the stage being lost in the process this is absolutely not the case with this movie i dont think ive ever seen a movie with this much energy this movie also does something that all all fiction should do it tells a story in a way only that medium can it uses the locations the costumes and the subtle symbolism that would be lost in any other medium first if you can see it on a big screen do so i usually wind up checking my watch or looking at the curtains or thinking about something not involving the theater when i see something on the big screen but not with this one the format of the big screen is used to its best here the big dance numbers feel grand and the quiet character moments feel personal and affecting this is to the credit of cinematographer linus sandgren who should win best cinematography hands downthe direction of the movie is absolutely astounding there are many sequences without any spoken or sung dialogue that are among the highlights of the movie i dont know anyone who can do showdont tell as well as damien chazelle a lot of character is also reflected in the truly stellar costume designer mary zophres not only does these costumes look really really good but they are an important indicator of character for example the costume we first see seb in clearly shows the audience that hes really into retroi would be remiss to review this show and not discuss the jaw dropping score the songs are all excellent with lovely jazzy melodies by justin hurwitz and witty lyrics by benj pasek and justin paul there arent many of these songs theres a story reason for that but theyre all gems i would especially like to call out the final sung song the fools who dream the melody is somewhat melancholy but very sweet the lyrics are witty with a twinge of sadness i will talk more about singing and acting later but this is the song where emma stone gives her all this is also the rare movie where i notice the instrumental score also by mr hurwitz it uses recurring themes or leitmotifs if you will absolutely stunningly mia and sebastians theme is never sung but it was one of the songs that i was humming on my way out of the theater mandy moore no not that one takes these tunes and choreographs them with suitably retro sensibilities this film has drawn many comparisons to singing in the rain and her choreography is a good piece of why also tap dancing i never get sick of tap dancingthe actors all knock it out of the park particularly emma stone the movie is tightly focused on mia ms stone and sebastian ryan gosling but the smaller characters are all good ryan gosling plays this role with elegance and arrogance prickliness and sensitivity however he is eclipsed by emma stone her role is somewhat underwritten but you wouldnt realize it unless you were staring at the script ms stone can express more emotion with a slight movement of her eyes than her peers can with their whole bodies she takes the character and makes her a person in ways the script really doesnt i will be absolutely shocked if she doesnt win best actress in february the one point of the movie that has some technical flaws is the singing but i think its justified if you are looking to this movie for big broadway belts you are looking the wrong way this movie has a quieter style to its singing that works very well as for the leads they arent perfect but they suit the material they sing i did not expect mr gosling to sing like that his singing voice is very unique maybe not the greatest technique in the world but its very jazzy and distinct ms stone spends much of the musical singing in her sweet but slightly breathy head voice and falsetto but as her final song proves she can also belt all of the singing is incredibly expressive the two leads also have glorious chemistry every conversation every dance break every glance from across the room is believable and you want these two together the moment they interact if you like musicals if you like emma stone or if you care about movies you should absolutely watch,happy
the dinner is served girls and boys ryan gosling and emma stone are here to dazzle you with this movie musical serving as ode to both 1950s musicals and screenwriterdirector damien chazelles love for jazz the story is generic but cosy as your favorite pillow jazz pianist boy meets waitress  aspiring actress girl and they fall in love and then a whole bunch of people dance and sing the two lovely stars are both singing and dancing themselves doing a good job at that still personally id have chosen an actress with stronger on screen presence to pair up with alreadylegendary gosling but you know whateveri am not actually into musicals so for me by far the most impressive thing about this feelgood crowdpleaser is the boss man behind the screen damien chazelle the dude is only nearly 32 years old but he has done three movies already always as a director and a sole screenwriter you know him better as the author of 2014s majestic surprise hit whiplashso go see it if you like musicals you will be pleased if you dont care about them theres still enough feelgood stuff to enjoy the ride for 128 minutesif you are a fan of whiplash dying to get another dose of chazelle then be prepared for a nice surprise in the form of certain bald guy who should have a bigger role here for sure,happy
the first time i watched i thought it was good but not amazing the more i thought about it and after a rewatch or two it just got better and better at the moment is my favorite film ever if i had to describe it in just a few words is magical it makes you feel joy heartbreak and hope throughout its running time and its endlessly entertaining and rewatchable its an homage to hollywood la and movies in general with great lead performances truly phenomenal cinematography and an incredible score that will stick with you for a long time i watched the film a year and a half ago and the music is still stuck in my head i really cant pick a favorite scene since the film is just so good but mias audition towards the end of the movie was the one that impressed me the most stones performance was wonderful and pretty much anyone can relate to the song shes singing i also think that making everything else but mia fade to black in that scene is a smart choice not only does it look great but it makes sure that the only thing we focus on is stones performance and the words to the song i dont know if i did justice with this review but its nothing short of a masterpiece i didnt think too much of it the first time i saw it but the more i thought about it and watched it the better and better it got note you know a film is great when it has an 81 on imdb and most of the onestar ratings say i just rated it this low to bring the score down,happy
i must say that i usually do not like musicals but quickly became my favourite movie it is a beautiful tribute to the cinema and to those who never quit of their dreams the cinematography is amazing and the same goes for all the choreographies the first scene when the cast sings another day of sun has the power to catch our attention to the rest of the movie the final scene epilogue can make us feel mad angry sad and happy at the same time is an incredible movie and i really suggest that everyone watches it even to those who dont support songs in movies,happy
i cant believe this movie was nominated for best picture must have been a slow year in hollywood after i had finished watching the film i had to come to imdb to read the plot summary to try and understand what this was all about still not sure what the director was trying to say i read that the budget for this film was 30000000 that money could have been put to much better use,happy
overall i really enjoyed it was energetic heartfelt and yet kind of slow at times but even with those slight issues with pacing and its anticlimactic ending i still really enjoyed for what it represented in 2016 in the end i decided to give a good on thevade review bar or a 7 out of 10 the acting music and visuals were excellent and for the most part its story was pretty entertaining it is definitely worth all of the praise it has been receiving and i will definitely be singing songs from this movie for years to comeread more at thevade,happy
there was so much buzz about this movie i was so desperate to see it made me smile a few times but thats it i am giving it 5 stars just because i love both the actors and their acting was good in it otherwise it was a dull movie with good music not going to suggest it to someone else,happy
i feel cheated i adored emma and ryan in crazy stupid love and came in already biased to love it its like the writer thought of every cheesy hook that would appeal to an agingmonochromatic academy yearning for former glory days then compiled a flatlined formula but set the gauge wrong so that even that ended up being off kilter a bit there was a barely discernible arc way too late in an already glacially paced series of badly shot and neglectfully choreographed pretty young things in colorful clothesi just couldnt muster up the energy to care about the leads let alone the 1 dimensional characters orbiting their lonely planeti did learn one thing black folk love jazz and they have soul so ryan must too when the film incongruously skips ahead 5 yearsdo people really abandon each other so thoroughly in the age of cellphones and we find that fame has its price i thought well theres isnt even the emotional payout this films formula surely promisedthen there was i almost felt something for a momenteven though it was a derivative montage of fabulous old musicals badly replicated in the alternative universe still i could have finally cared about the characters fate a smidgen whups then there wasnt again i really tried to feel the bittersweet pangs of regret i know i was supposed to feel but that too flatlined then i was just kind of mad,happy
honestly despite the critics i wasnt blown away i can see why the critics loved it so much though its a heavy handed loveletter to hollywood musicals and hollywood history and life it feels like a film made for la critics rather than the audience if you take away the musical and directorial elements the love story is so clichd yes even the bittersweet ending has become a clich nowadays when you want to be seen as being different and going against the hollywood ending and embracing gritty real lifethe worst bit wasnt the ending however that could be forgiven the worst bit was the contrived oh yes hes too busy with work to see her onewoman play which spells the end that was the low point of the movie for me it was a cringeworthy plot contrivance thats been done a million times and usually not in so heavy handed a way damien chazelle seems capable of writing the happier bits well enough because he can fall back on his love of cheerfulcolourful musicals but the more dramatic elements felt like he relied on the stereotypes and heavy handed symbolism oooh their relationship fails in the fall just when theyve had an argument the smoke alarm goes off because hes forgotten the meal cooking in the oven that comes out all burnt and over donethe songs also feel a little forced but it makes sense when you watch the makingof and realise that the music was written first and other people were brought in to quite literally force lyrics into the music rather than both being created at the same time this is a flimsy clichridden story written to join dance routines and music togetherother than that its fun enough and a bit different if only stylistically ill admit i did love some of the filming and was very impressed by some of the direction after watching the makingof and seeing the passion and enthusiasm that went into it and how someone got to make their dream project i really wanted to like the movie more in fact i actually admire the hollywood producers who wanted to back something that was a passion project rather than something designed purely with the boxoffice in mind unfortunately it all ends up a bit mediocre unless youre a critic who wants to praise it simply for being a loveletter to the superior hollywood musicals that inspired it this is for musical lovers what jupiter ascending is for action movie lovers great visuals and design some amazing direction some good actors get roped in and thats about it you come away neither disappointed nor elated,happy
without giving anything away there is a stark tonal shift at the close of the movie and this is a major problem people likely watchedwill want to watch this movie for its romantic nostalgic nod to hollywood thats the way was advertised and the majority of the film follows what was promoted  except the ending and that ruins the movieupon doing some reading after seeing the movie the director was trying to be complex with the ending and perhaps because of his youth and inexperience as a filmmaker it looks like he was trying to be too cleverwas a repeat viewing movie  until the ending and now i just want to forget about this movie and am glad it didnt win best picture,happy
obviously there is a little of a problem when you watch a movie as acclaimed as this one this will always generate a slightly unfair expectation biasstill battling through opening scenes which are simply boring wondering when the movie may start taking a few unexpected turns dreading the reappearance of people singing mediocrely and without much inspiration not much good can be said about the first hour and even the rest i spent far from captivated by a disastrously simple story line girl meets boy repeatedly they fall in love both are very talented and underappreciated artists boy acts stupid girl sets him straight one row and the relationship is on pause boy rescues girl from low selfesteem they both have to follow their dream which rips them apart years later they meet again both successful and appreciated now still love each other but oh the tragedy they cant be together and before we can leave we have to sit through an alternative universe dream where everything went perfectthere is basically a complete absence of witty dialog all elements are pieced together to selfcelebrate hollywood at times the picture gets so cheesy the screen threatens to turn into caramel add a happyend and you would doubtlessly leave with a sugar overdose as it is its tolerable whats rescuing this movie from the jaws of lethal pathos is its cinematographic master class the electric magic between emma stone and ryan gosling which is wellproved by now and a main score track which carries some spice the sheer number of awards this movie has received is hard to understand for me,happy
i was expecting a lot from this movie from the reviews and everything people were saying about it  it was quite the disappointmenti liked moulin rouge or mama mia way morethe photography of the movie was beautiful when scenes fade to black to put the main protagonists at the center of the pictures these are well done emma stone is extremely photogenic and looked great in that picture ryan gosling has the charm he is known for color contrast visuals these were great to see some of the scenes almost felt like paintings or work of artemma stone range of emotions and acting are that of a great actress she gave life to the movie i wasnt really convinced by ryan gosling acting though he always seem to play the same guy in all of his movies sabout the songs and the pace of the movie they felt really really dull i kept looking at my watch and waiting for it to be over maybe a second screening is necessary but that was the feeling i had while watching the moviethe songs didnt feel full of energy they mostly made me want to sleepthe main issue i had with the story of the movie is that it goes in messy plain delirium sometimesthe instrumental parts without any people singing were really good especially the piano parts these were the parts that lent the most emotions and getting us to dream in my humble opinion i could close my eyes and just feel the musicall in all beautiful photography disappointing musical,happy
i can defend almost everything about this movie like certain leaps of logic thats normal for the genre gosling and stones vocals start out flatly but they grow into the songs the colors and emmas dresses were eye catching they began with a peppy dance number right before we meet the hero  heroine the movie should have ended that waybefore the epilogue musicals usually have tackedon happy endings not tackedon depressing endings i felt cheated and thought this doesnt make sense,happy
it seems likely that is going to continue to pick up a rack of wins during the award season this alone makes it worth watching as you can either agree or disagree with the awards panels around the globefor those people who dont know it is a musical that harks back to the classical musicals of the mid 20th century the main storyline of the movie is the relationship between mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling to be fair the two leads throw themselves into the movie and there is certainly chemistry between them to be honest there was probably less music and dance than i expected the movie is a little too sweet for my tastes and i didnt especially care about what happened to any of the characters anyway you need to see the film and see what you think as theres no doubt that a lot of other people rate it extremely highly,happy
i said no no noononononononononnononononononon no more,happy
nothing great musical was subpar dont understand why it scored so high if anyone could reply and tell me what is so great about this movie i would appreciate itthere was nothing special did not even know it came out on theaters they want five lines and when there is not even five lines to write about that is pretty sad,happy
there is an old joke that states if man could orally pleasure himself he would curl up in a ball and never leave home this is hollywood doing just that and then giving itself a participation trophy for its magnificent performance singers dancers and musicians who cant sing dance or play,happy
i loved whiplash but this is a nauseating saccharine look at hollywood from damien chazelle nearly every scene socks you in the face with a bright oversaturated colour palate of primary colours blues greens reds and yellows the music is completely forgettable with not one song and dance number standing out the plot is pretty generic and takes no unexpected turns boy meets girl they fall in love they each succeed with their careers but this causes them to break up the end seriously that is the whole plot of beef that flimsy premise out to 2 hours of movie with plenty of boring songs and watch the oscars come pouring ini did enjoy the chemistry and acting of the two leads which while not oscar worthy was adequate chazelles a talented director no doubt about it and there are some nice camera moves and shot compositions on offer here but he is capable of much better than this,happy
to me the oscars nowadays means that the critics all got together and decided to play a popularity contest that quite often the mainstream movie going public doesnt see eye to eye with i love musicalslike adore themso i was excited for lala land and so i was disappointed and confused by the fact that it did not come close to fulfilling expectations i will say there were a couple of scenes that were very well done the film has a unique vibe that is timeless and some of the dance and music scenes are reminiscent of an era gone by it is definitely an artistic film however the story and the characters and the climax of the film is utterly and completely bland its not the type of film i could watch more than once and i dont understand how it is even classified as a musical when it had very few blatant musical numbers and it felt like it was more about jazz or lala land itself than the music the hardest part to accept was the lack of chemistry with the stars and just the overall lack of a solid story to hold ontoemma stone is notable for this film because she is emma stone she has an undeniable chemistry on screen and it always works at least a little bit still her struggling character actress is okay at best and she never really goes through any arc at all and youre left feeling very underwhelmed ryan gosling honestly is downright terrible i dont know if its the writing or what but his character is vapid and empty and boring their romance is silly and contrived and it never takes off despite them trying desperately to make you root for these two somehow the music brings them together and their love of the arts there is some supporting cast but honestly no one comes even close to being memorable or stepping up to anything its overall a very large disappointmentif the film was just a few dance scenes with gosling and stone i might be inclined to love it but unfortunately they make you sit through a subpar story first i guess the choreography and some of the scenes are worth noting the thing is i adore writer and director damien chazelle whiplash was literally incredible easily one of the best films of the year i had such high hopes this would be more of the same and i get the art behind it and the neon glow and the story of los angeles and struggling artists but there is no meat here there is nothing that captivates you and a film that won all kinds of awards and nearly won best picture is barely memorable film schools might study it but for me once is enough 510,happy
if you have a 30 million dollar budget i hope you get some things right the cinematography and aesthetic quality of the film were pretty great and it had its emotional momentsemma stone  ryan gosling respectively breathed life into their inherently boring  unoriginal roles the story itself kinda makes me want to vomit in my mouth though it did seem like they were going for a rather corny set up so i wont let personal bias get in the way of thatbottom line you dont really care about either of these characters their love is nothing gripping its not forbidden or difficult for that matter and he doesnt even have to try and woo her just keeps running into her and eventually he must think alright might as well give it a try this is the 5th time ive seen hercannot believe that this has a 99 rating on sites i usually rely on must be a candidate for the most overhyped movie of all time and to the critics that gave it 10 stars shame on you for diluting the quality hollywood should be able to achieveif you want an award winning movie that delivers on raw  truthful emotion and the human experience see what moonlight did for 120th yes check me the budget,happy
a movie which has 6 oscars in their pocket praise from the critics and a runtime of 132 minutes cant be boring i stopped watching the movie at the 20th something minute it was boring and felt like it was dragged this masterpiece never really puts the clutch in the 2nd gear it was constantly slowed down and the dance performances were bleak it was missing additional extras for the explosivenessnow go and see beauty and the beast it is everything that is not,happy
2 ratings because it is my second worst movie ever well there are movies which are not even worth mentioning or rating but it is worst in the sense that it just could have been betteri can definitely give 10 ratings for the story and 8 for the acting but the emotions and feeling brought in by the movie is just  no feelings at all the flowpace how the movie progressed was certainly good but it lacked the touch and feel what should have radiated from the story the last 20 min or so just sort of fast forwarded and i could say the directors could not bring out even 1 of emotions which the ending could have brought,happy
just a brief note to say it is sweet sweet sweet dream tale about hollywood and for hollywood nothing real however there will be on stage musical soon no doubt just in time to make this kind of film to give crowd a new musical nice and easy and nothing to worry about you can go and watch it and enjoy for a couple of hours as you will not really remember it after or you can just miss it your choice,happy
a movie full of clichs that it hurts driving a prius having an iphone making it so fast and well in the artists world without a hitch la hollywood casablanca and the list can go on forever all these combined with the socalled musical themed plot result in the boring piece that im reviewing now ok ryan is cute but he tries too much to look interested in his jazz career emma is also cute but she just seems to play a role and nothing more than thatbottom line boring 2 hours of movie of what could have been shorter and more descriptive go watch borat i guarantee youll be more entertained,happy
not quite sure about script which felt very familiar and bythe numbers but the artistry was there the opening was dazzling and energetic but being that i do live in los angeles saw the failings in such as one line of cars was facing the wrong way with a concrete barrier in between also despite being a traffic jam the surrounding freeways were very clear which is not typical other than early morning on the weekendthe subsequent numbers were also enjoyable and colorful the music solid although i should have watched it with earphones the performances were very good but would come short of saying they were oscar worthy there wasnt a range of emotions with stone to warrant it although gosling ends up being effective and a great screen presence i generally find his actual performances somewhat cold but kudos to him learning the piano for the role it was an effective elementbut in the end the story was very textbook traditional love story between two who were at first opposites it did try to break the mold with them not being together in the end but fell short and provoked more questions than satisfaction then the alternate ending which i more thought was a what if from the gosling character was colorful,happy
but the truth is that this movie i did not like i never liked that in the middle of a movie they started to dance and sing i can not find logic this is the same thing although the second song surprised me how well round it is it has a lot of rhythm and is well designed and very well composed and designedit is a love story but it is not a great love story that if the end i kill its the best thing about the moviethey are well acting yes but when they dance im bored although maybe im not the best to say it but i have to say that i do not think the couple with the most spark ive seen the photography is spectacular thats true she is very pretty he is cheerfulthe direction i do not like the planes are simple and it bores mea beautiful setting that must be saidthe basic problem is that this genre either you like or you do not like,happy
its not a horrible movie but i dont understand the growing hype either i went to see this no expectations except some decent musical entertainment andi dont know whats good emma stone and ryan gosling are charming to me as the leads the aspiring actressplaywright and the truetooldschool jazz musician the songs are okay nothing tremendously memorable but i did like the city of stars tune that gosling sings on the pier and later duets on again with stone the other stuff the dancing was cute but not fantastic the actors did the best they could and god knows they did better than i ever could but they looked a little uncomfortable doing it like they were counting out the steps in their heads what wasnt so great the premise was fine but its nothing new and the film had a lot of slow areas where i kind of felt bored like the writers added what they thought was clever dialogue but actually came across as filler to make up some time in the movie while some people didnt like the planetariumfantasy dance scene i thought that was one of the better old hollywood type scenes in this film nice little twist as the film draws toward its conclusion and it wasnt dumbed down with a ton of explanations as if the audience were clueless that made up for the dry spots earlier on so its not a bad film or anything but again i dont understand the oscar build up on this because there seem to be other films with more to offer out there to each their own i guess,happy
a modern take on the classic hollywood musical it baffles me how such a high profile movie can divide opinion so much with reviews here ranging from 1  a waste of time to 10  my best movie ever i think the hype surrounding this movie has left a lot of people feeling robbed and angry i went to see the movie open minded ill qualify my views by firstly stating im a male in the over 40s age bracket ive thoroughly enjoyed movies like grease and moulin rouge in the pasti would say that this films appeal is that its different to the run of the mill hollywood films that could be why its getting so much attention suddenly we have a new film which isnt like all the others from that point of view its a good effort for the most part it does actually work quite will if you stick with it performances from the two lead actors are goodafter the opening sequence and early stages of the movie i was unsure where it was going however i started to find it pleasant to watch whilst the music score and singing are not the best it was sufficient however i found the end was disappointing and left me feeling flat i think a movie like this must have a happy ending in my view dare i say it this movie will appeal mostly to a female audience who appreciate something different decide for yourself,happy
i just cant begin to understand the irrational hype over this movie it is good its very beautifully filmed and edited and has a intriguing although wellworn story line it boasts measured and tasteful acting as well as attractive actors of course it even features some really awesome jazz but thats about where it ends shouldnt a musical include some actual song and dance talent the dancing is well pedestrian the singing ranges from decent to awful its difficult to understand who thought it was a good idea to cast ryan gosling in a singing role its more painful to listen to than pierce brosnan in mamma mia will probably win lots more awards i just wish someone would explain to me why,happy

i just come from seen these movie today was argentinas premier and i didnt want to miss it because all the fuss built around itfor me its a good movie something different from what you get to see lately from hollywood very risky project ryan gosling learned to play piano for these movie and you can see all the hard work made by everyone involved music art photography some times beautifulbut it didnt get me like seems to have gotten everyone 14 oscar nominations i dont think so its nothing out of these world i think ryan does deserve it and its a fine movie to go and see to spend the afternoon also as a jazz player myself i found some old clichs same as whiplash although that one was more close to reality than lala land overall pretty nice lovestory spoke through music not a masterpiece,happy
first of all i like musical films but this was supposed to be a tribute to the greatest musical performers in old hollywood gene kelly fred astaire ginger rogers etc it was a lie because it was a clich love story of a young couple sebastian and miathe scripts structure isnt great neither narrated by seasons the characters mia emma stone an aspiring actress and sebastian ryan gosling a man who wants to make jazz popular again the rest of the characters are just there lost in the script doesnt matter if they exist and the end is like the supporting characters too is like those quickly ending scenes where the movie doesnt feel completenow ill be honest emma does her best and gives an acceptable performance but ryan can barely sing and is worse when he dances no coordination with emma and graceless dance steps disguised by the sound department with tap sounds the musical numbers are forgettable too city of stars is good but no great and the old hollywood tribute is just a casablancas window rebel without a cause some posters and dance steps good joke for publicize the moviedespite all these the good things in the movie the sound editing and mixing the art direction gives this film different places with urban atmosphere and the costume design and makeuphairstyling department also contribute to make the story something that everyone can feel identifiedmaybe is for all this the success but cant match on to classics like singing in the rain an american in paris sound of music and more for conclude if you like musicals you can enjoy the film if you want to revive the old hollywood charm searchs other movie,happy
disappointing the story ending seemed like a compromise i wasnt impressed by the flashback to what their life could have been like it wasnt mimicking the ending of legendary musicals like singing in the rain or films like a star is born about a couple whose stars are in opposing trajectories so what was it trying to achieve a muddled and unsatisfying finish was all i was left with they both get what they want in their careers but not each other hmmm the music is weak overall mumbly and the dancing isnt remarkable apart from the opening number its beautiful to look at and the production values keep the whole thing running to a point but you can only admire the beauty that david wasco austin gorg and sandy reynoldswasco created production design art direction and set decoration for so long i expected more from damien chazelle maybe if he had stuck to directing and given the story over to someone else it might have made me like it more,happy
15 january 2017film of choice at the plaza dorchester tonight  its los angeles circaany time you want a guy meets a girl they fall in love whats new in fact very little is new in this film weve kind of seen it all before yet there is a little sparkle that makes it different the script is fairly ordinary and the songs are fairly bland however bring both these together and some magic happens emma stone produces a pretty good performance as a girl trying to make it in hollywood she has some good opportunity to show a repertoire of various acting skills as her character trawls round audition after audition trying to break into the industry ryan gosling plays a jazz musician passionate about his music but unable to bring his dream to fruition and having to sacrifice his goals in order to make ends meet musician meets actress and our story has begun this film is trying to mix the modern with the glory days of hollywood past and although successful in many ways it doesnt quite reach the spot having said that i enjoyed it immensely anything with a little song and dance is sure to keep me entertained the bright colours and jazz music evoke memories of the grand days of the big studios yet we know we are in modern times as technology is evident in most scenes this is a film i recommend you see if only took form your own opinion just because the industry likes it doesnt mean you have to although i did,happy
so i am not a musical movie person my friend really wanted to see it my parents had us watch sound of music as kids and it was constant i think that sadly scarred me for life i do still like that movie just havent watched it since then so the first part was cheesy and lots of musical parts so i wasnt a fan the second part was much better almost zero musical parts overall it was a cute romantic sweet movie there is the f word once in it by gosling a few other words as well heads up for any families watching it i would assume mostly women are the audience for this type of movie i feel like the second half was a bit drawn out if you love musicals and romance i can see why it received the ratings it has,happy
there are good news and bad newsthe good news is that if you know nothing about musicals then is going to tell you all about the creme de la creme top hat an american in paris mary poppins singin in the rain both in very specific references and the most obvious influence of all especially in terms of characters and narrative the umbrellas of cherbourg not only is the essential history of musicals part of this film but everythings also impeccably executed ryan gosling and emma stone are both remarkably subtle as well and for once in a colorful hollywood romance none of the main characters steps over the other note that theres a woody allen sleeping in goslings character a very traditional artist who refuses to open up to other peoples tastes and opinions not sure if mentioning mr allen is a compliment or not but seriously even the most skeptics of you about musicals will have a good timethe bad news is that this is one long long long movie that ends a million consecutive times dont you hate it when youre watching a movie and you get the feeling that it ends a first time then it ends again then again and again and again to the extent that you no longer know if its ever going to end at all the director damien chazelle is also developing his gimmicks that he might be unfortunately mistaking for trademark fast consecutive inserts referencing anecdotes about great musicians building sonic climax and breaking it abruptly also if youre expecting to find some of the tension remaining from chazelles previous coupdematre whiplash you wont because he has moved on to a more contemplative more harmonious and less scientific place about music and he wants everybody to know it to sum up the major difference between whiplash and in terms of experience as a spectator you eat whiplash and you sipby the way you can thank the producers for approving of a notsohappyafterall ending for an alist hollywood movie hallelujahyou might get bored here and there however you should be convinced by the likability of the cast the delicious 40s threecolorstripreferencing cinematography and the shockingly impressive steadicam work will also manage to steal a few good laughs from you,happy
i love movies like once and sing street that feature music but arent truly musicals in that the dialog isnt sung im not at all a fan of the musical where nearly all the dialog is sung i was a little worried during the start of that wed encountered the latter and while the musical numbers were entertaining they were pretty ordinary however as the movie progressed the singing decreased and the dialog and story got more interesting ultimately i enjoyed the film and the music and thought it struck a nice balance between dialog that was sung and dialog that was spoken nice performances by gosling and stone as well and i appreciated the ending which wasnt quite what many might expect or want,happy
fresh off of his smash hit whiplash writerdirector damien chazelle has returned with another original in the throwback musicalforthescreen the film follows the two protagonists mia emma stone a barista who struggles to make it as an actress in hollywood and sebastian ryan gosling a jazz pianist who was fired from his previous steady work and has struggled to move on both professionally and personally ever sincelight spoilers to follow with heavy spoilers laterthe plot follows mia and sebastian as they experience a series of chance meetings a traffic jam on the interstate mia finding him playing in a night club a party mia attends where sebastian also happens to be playing etc it probably means something sebastian remarks probably not mia replies the two then sing a song about how there is no spark of romantic interest between them despite the audience and each other knowing that is falsethe film is a dizzying array of technicolor and from the studio logos to the final roll you can tell youre in a film that is meant as a love letter to the golden age of hollywood on a technical level the craft is so tightly wound that aficionados will likely lose their grip on the narrative as theyre swept into the beautiful sights sounds camerawork and stage blocking that can sometimes be distracting in their virtuosityconsider for instance the films opening shot we pan from beautiful blue clouds into a sea of unnamed singers dancers and yes even musicians and bmx bikers as they sing about their experience moving to california hoping to make it some viewers may be so distracted by the level of technical skill on display in this opening scene that they may not realize that it doesnt even establish the films plot only its mood and settingin terms of casting the film is pitch perfect stone  gosling have excellent chemistry and in a film that relies heavily on visual storytelling chazelle struck gold landing two leads with expressive faces emotive range and who are both in the prime of their careersheavy spoilers aheadafter a series of clich setups we arrive at the films core the film is a love story but the love story is not simply between mia and sebastian it is also a love story between modern cinema and the golden age of hollywood the film sweeps you away on a current of whimsy but if you pause a moment to reflect on the course of the narrative you will find that the waters are not so deep after all the film shows mia living with three housemates all who are vying for stardom as she is why should we care for her success any more than theirs and for sebastian he presents himself as a loner and a hermit with selfdestructive tendencies why should we sympathize with this characterthe best reason that the film provides is that the two characters are played by the films leads emma stone and ryan gosling and be warned how you answer this question will largely determine whether you like this moviefor my final take on this film i would suggest that disliking based on the premise of inadequate justification for investment in the romance plot is to miss the point the point isnt whether you care about mia  sebastian the point is that mia  sebastians lives symbolize the cinema of old coming into the modern age one subplot involves sebastians dream to open a night club where he picks the music costar john legend asks the rhetorical question that gets to the heart of the film how are you gonna be a revolutionary if youre such a traditionalist you hold onto the past but jazz is about the future if you substitute cinema for jazz i think you get the heart of the films messageand here is where i will hold out several examples to illuminate my point on this subject the film subverts expectations at many turns as i was leaving the theater i noted that something negative follows nearly every musical number with very few exceptions at the end of the opening number theyre still in a traffic jam after a breathtakingly staged dance at a party mias car is towed after mia sings audition near the films end that signals the end of her relationship with sebastian the film closes with a journey five years into the future mia has married another man and is raising a child sebastian has started his nightclub unsurprisingly a chance happening causes their paths to cross yet again sebastian spots mia in the crowd and plays a piece that if not actually then certainly in the film is so beautiful that it transports he and mia into a fantasy world where all of the negative things that theyve encountered together hadnt existed its beautiful fantastic and everything youd expect in a storybook endingbut this isnt a storybook ending the film closes with mia  sebastian exchanging knowing glances from opposite ends of the nightclub and mia leaving with her husband just like in the case of new jazz this musical is a new tune played with a lot of familiar notes seems like a breath of fresh air because of how beautifully it repackages and then subverts the old tunes we know and love it is silly to speculate on what direction chazelles career will take after this film but his body of work thus far has demonstrated that it will be both beautiful and emotionalthanks for reading,happy
there is nothing else that could be said about it apart from what im going to it is a movie of true profound beauty one that touches your soul and leaves you in silence and awe and all of this is because it deals with something we all face at some point  what is right to choose in life when our dreams also require great compromises i truly recommend everyone to see especially in a movie theatre to discover with their own eyes the great talent of emma stone and ryan gosling and the chemistry they share on the big screen surely without a pair such as this one the experience would have been much different  it is a film that relies on their performances which are executed flawlessly from the first scene in which they appear to the very end all of their passions desires and conflicts are full of life you can see it in their eyes dance moves and gestures with each other the cinematography is fantastic and the musical score has been part of my playlist ever since watching the movie for the first time i couldnt resist going more than once the costume design is superb i hope i didnt understate the beauty of this film but in all seriousness if you can please go see it is a work of art,happy
i built up a high level of anticipation in seeing this film i enjoy both ryan g and emma s as actors and like music the high ratings on imdb also added to the anticipation i found myself quite engrossed in the story and where it was going it was filled with the day to day ups and downs of life and the beauty of aspiring to dreams and love i play the piano and enjoy jazz and dancing so appreciated the melodic intertwining of the music through the story line both main actors did a good job with the dancing and singing given they are not professionals in these areas as much as i enjoyed the film i found myself a bit flat at the end as i didnt interpret the ending as a joyous one unlike other reviewers that said it was inspiring and a feel good ending this was not the case for me i felt the ending could have been done much better and there was too much of a gap in the story that was covered in the last 15 or so mins i enjoyed the singing dancing story and overall cinematography the movie had a great realistic emotional romantic feel to it just felt a bit let down at the end though,happy
is simply one of the most beautiful films ive ever seen coming from someone whose favorite movie of all time is black swan i tend to like darker movies but this more romantic movie blew most movies ive seen in my lifetime out of the water at the surface its a simple boymeetsgirl love story but the real magic lies in the artistic direction i came into this movie expecting a lot due to chazelles previous work of art whiplash and i left the theater absolutely satisfied the way the visual effects music and dance play out in this movie make it the masterpiece that it truly is emma stone is the perfect amount of quirky for the lead female role while ryan gosling is the perfect amount of dapper for the lead male role the two have great chemistry onscreen the transition from musical moments to serious ones to comedic ones is seamless please go see this masterpiece it is so worth your money,happy
is one of the greatest movies of 2016 it has career defining performances from ryan gosling and emma stone the highlight being stone the cinematography and music are the other two highlights both being some of the best of the past decade the movie is a great homage to old musicals like signin in the rain and does this extremely well opening with things like cinema scope and technicolor in addition the dancing has some of the best choreography for dancing in a movie since movies like signin in the rain it should get nominated for best cinematography best picture best actress best director best production design best actor best original song and best original score 1010 go see it now,happy
dreams lala land is about dreams the tag line isheres to the fool who dreamsand its truly fitting emma stone was lovely charming and bright per usual fan of hers since easy a but i was most impressed with ryan gosling i had no idea he was so talented i was astonished by his grace and pure perfection as sebastian i mean ryan gosling as a jazz musician was everything i never knew i needed he sang he danced he was absolutely sublime like many others would say emma and ryan have a chemistry that is undeniable and its hard not to watch them together on screen they are captivating to watch the energy flows through them and into the audience and its really something special john legend was pretty excellent in a supporting role initially it took me a second seeing him in a different capacity but he was great acting isnt his trade but i liked seeing him even though i thought it was a bit brief having him sing in the film was a real treat for those who may not be familiar with his music his voice is like a fine wine like honey in your mouth  thick rich and sweet his addition to the cast was smart and really upped the ante musically because john is just so supremely talentedas far as direction damien chazelle was able do what so few directors can and that is create magic on film its really astonishing considering the undertaking this film mustve been for someone whos only directed one other feature film lala land was directed as if by a seasoned veteran scenes were seamless and so precise in some parts it felt like i was watching a live play the film is the best kind of fantasy filled with love joy and life you cant help but walk away thinking about your own dreams feeling inspired to make those dreams a reality this film is a homage a love song to a film genre thats been long gone and sorely missed it reminded me of old hollywood glamour  the sophistication and raw talent seemed to have the audience gripped from start to finish it was refreshing and yet envelops you like a warm blanket on a chill winters morning it was effortless clean and pure perfectioni did like that the film also had some clear undertones and commentary on hollywood as well as personal growth without saying too much i think that these points really rounded out the film making it very robust and multidimensional the film was able to position itself as somewhat nostalgic while not being clich or predictable one of my favorite lyrics in the film is madness is key to give us new colors to see and this is so true and poignant when it comes to the dreamer the dreamer is mad considered not to be practical  similarly steve jobs once said the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do sometimes madness and genius go hand in hand so dont fear it embrace it embrace the mad chaotic beauty of having big dreams hold tightly to them and remember that its always worth the fight to make it a realitybottom line lala land is a must see you must experience the songs the dancing the joy and happiness this film brings you it infuses you with hope and sends you back out into the world as a dreamer i highly suggest this film be experienced by all it is an incredible achievement  the amout of applause at the end of the screening i saw as deafening this is a definite oscar contender no question about it go see it a,happy
powerful musicals make me feel like its a crime to put words to them after seeing it was clear to me that the film was one of the best theatre experiences i will ever havei worship the beauty of its all so big and beautiful and emma stone is brilliant she does the best thing an actress can do to find a way to be the most compelling woman in the room without having to be the loudest she conveys the most power through her subtleties and this is partly due to her wonderful chemistry with gosling the humanistic wonder expressed through gosling and stones eyes when they look at each other is enough to carry any movie the music is the spirit of their romance this is especially prevalent in their intense moments with one another like in the planetarium sequence its just as much about their faces while they dance as it is the dancing portrays extremely vital parts of human existence that are easily forgotten about and given towards normality or daily life stone sings that a little bit of madness is key in an ode to the ones who dream this particular song makes cements the already prevalent attitude of the film that vision imagination hope endurance and love make the impossible a realitybrutal realism in film and real life complements the hazy dynamics of love making the emotion so much more powerful within the human being the dynamic screenplay adds to the films realism contributing to its overall power for example when you see the scenes like her at his concert like him missing her play its clear how much they love each other but how in order to fulfill themselves and become who they are they need to do it separately then their lives took them away from each other and she met someone else and had kids it all becomes clear at sebs at the end they still love each other but almost too much their circumstances make it so they couldnt be together theyre too invested in each other and have to be near each other and in their two journeys do not collide well enough to be sustainable is a movie about love and passion the intersection and division of both within the creative life,happy
i am a great fan of musicals i own over 700 of them on dvd and lecture on the subject all over israel i eagerly anticipated this film which arrived in israel on december 16th i am disappointedin parts this film is good the opening sequence on the freeway superb but parts of the film were simply boringly slow the music and songs were good but not outstandingly memorable the hit song city of stars was not allowed to be performed fully and the marvelous and colorful dance sequence towards the end was cut shamefully short the jazz sequences were terrific if you like jazz as the dialog points outryan gosling is a revelation as a singerdancer and pianist but everyone else was average the constant panning of the camera was a distraction but the long continuous single takes work very well particularly emma stones audition song the dance sequence between the two stars into the clouds was poor not even in the same class as as woody allen and diane keatonthe film is described by some as a tribute to fred and ginger hardly and i wonder how many of the current reviews from such limited distribution are from actors and luvvies fromyes this is a good film one i might watch again but the advance hype is not supported by what i saw on screen the audience seemed to like it with the odd exception and maybe i am being too critical which is likely reflected in the likes for my review but this is not in my opinion a musical that will stand the test of time as a blockbuster,happy
as soon as the trailer for this movie came out i had a vague notion that it would garner a lot of praise from hollywood and be thoroughly undeservingthe wife was on me to see it and i begrudgingly relented when i thought my mood that sunday afternoon would be best suited to stomaching this tripeunfortunately i couldnt stomach ithollywood is far too in love with itself someone somewhere along the line needed to tell them that emma stones and ryan goslings voices arent up the leads in a musical the only decent song that i can even vaguely remember included gosling whistling i watched the movie 18 hours ago and thats the best ive gotthe acting isnt up to scratch from the two leads and if either of them win an oscar it will be a travestyhow this film could win over lion hidden figures or hacksaw ridge is beyond me and i went into lion and hidden figures sure i wouldnt fall in love with them either i wish i could tell you this film gets better towards the end but i fell asleep it was that baddont bother,happy
2016  12 out of 4 struggling jazz musician sebastian ryan gosling meets struggling actress mia emma stone and together they try to make their mark in hollywoodis a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and ended up grabbing fourteen oscarnominations the film is a homage to hollywood and everything that hollywood used to produce this of course is a musical so the film pays respect to the type of film that mgm and hollywood was pumping out in the 1950s is the film worthy of all the praise its getting calling a film overrated is something that will strike up an argument on any message board but while i dont think the film was that great theres no question that its an extremely charming film with two great performancesi will start off with what i didnt love about the film one was the opening dance number which was impressive in regards to how it was shot but at the same time i must admit that it really didnt pull me into the film id also say that i didnt love any of the songs in the picture a couple were nice but i really didnt walk out of the theater singing any of them finally i did feel that the film went on a bit too long and would have benefited from about tenminutes being cut outwith all of that out of the way there was still a lot of stuff here that i really enjoyed but theres no question that the greatest thing were the two leads gosling and stone were so great and so wonderfully charming together that you couldnt help but fall in love with their characters and want to see them succeed i really thought both of them did a terrific job in their acting their dancing and their singing and you can honestly say that they were among the most entertaining couples from recent memory they really get to shine with the comedy the romance and the drama and they really pack a great punchi also really loved the jazz music in the picture the music is certainly something wonderful and it just perfectly builds up the story and delivers the goods the film also benefits from some wonderful costume and production design with brilliant uses of colors that just leap off the screen as i said the film is a homage to hollywood and theres some great dialogue about older movies older stars and of course jazz musiciansits easy to see why people and especially hollywood are in love with its a great throwback to the type of romantic comedies and musicals that were made in a different era im sure many young people were seeing this type of film for the first time hopefully some of those who loved this will go out and seek out the classics that this is paying homage to,happy
i would like to begin this review by saying that i dont give anything away spoilers free review and all i say is in no way hyping the film the film is just that good fellas it is difficult and quite honestly impossible for me to take a minute sit down and think what did i truly liked the most out of this film lets start off by saying that ever since sebastian ryan gosling takes the piano and plays it i felt so drawn by the sheer melody here i am a day later and it is just implanted in my subconscious i find myself whistling city of stars like i just heard it for the first time without giving anything away ryan goslings dedication for the role is of the utmost respect and its result is majestic speaking of which the soundtrack of this film is undeniably addictive it is emotionally driven with the style of jazz on its back yes it is a musical the music plays a big role but it is unbelievable how the music in this film isnt its greatest achievementbefore revealing the greatest achievement i would like to praise other key factors o the film the costumes the cinematography of the movie scenes  which where incredibly satisfying for the eyesight the colors of the sets the choreography which was traditional and old school everything surrounding the greatest achievement of the film gave that little extra boost needed for it to be one of the best movie experiences ive ever hadwithout further ado the coup de grce was the final sequence the last 10 minutes of the film all throughout the film the character development was incredible and it lead to me being completely emotionally drawn to both of the characters by the end of the film at the end you can feel the atmosphere you can actually feel what they are meant to feel and how they react to it the movie itself is nearperfect but it isnt until the last sequence that it reaches perfection for a movie to be so good and end in a perfect note it just doesnt get any better than that 1010,happy
never been moved much by musicals though ive always admired those of fred astaire but this movie is not some glitzy rehumanization of being rich during the depression its actually almost the opposite a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business one an actress the other a jazz pianistthing is the two leads here emma stone and ryan gosling are not easy to picture in a romantic musical but without a doubt theyre an inspired choice who will make you wonder just how much talent is there in hollywood its mindboggling to contemplate whats more these two fine actors are so evenly matched here that its impossible to tell which came first the pairing or the script clearly they had an uncanny grasp of the form though its been years since theres been such a successful onethis movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that its not worth picking a few just go see it even if you dont like musicals it will win you over,happy
linus sandgren is a true genius thanks for a great movie looking forward to meet u in london how is betty and lucy please write back go linus go linus greathugs bingoplease read thisin his first film since whiplash damien chazelle stages a lavish songanddance musical that dares to swoon the oldfashioned way with ryan gosling and emma stone as la dreamersthere was a moment back in the 1970s sometime before grease came out when the image of people bursting into song and dance in the middle of a motion picture wasnt simply corny and antiquated it had come to seem downright strange not any more our era is immersed in retro musical culture and it has been for a while  from the visionary postmodern pop swoon of moulin rouge to the online resurgence of music video to the highcamp a capella sincerity of glee and the pitch perfect films so what does it take to make a musical today look unabashedly exotic,happy
where was the magic where was the awe where was that memorable moment that makes you wish you could sing like that and dance like thatforgetting the fact this was a musical as a movie in its own right i couldnt connect with the characters or their story and that is a big failing in itselfthe musical performances from the leads werent inspiring to rescue this film for meusually the male and female lead will complement or supplement the others ability to sing and dancethink grease and you can forgive john travoltas singing because of his charisma swagger and dance moves plus olivia newton johns singing and the appeal of the original songs carried his lack of chops as a singerla la lands principal leads lacked the chemistry and charisma to make us forgive their lack of singing and dancing abilitieseven the opening musical number failed to grab my interest as there was no show stopping dance moves or singing performances from the cast and i patiently waited for things to get better but for me it didntshame as i was looking forward to watching it and really wanted to enjoy it,happy
is a beautiful and heartbreaking film about putting aside love for dreams youve had your whole life dont let the musical aspect of this film be the reason you dont go see it incredible performances from gosling and especially stone make the two hour run time fly and make you feel and connect with the pair as you see them juggle their love for each other while working in hollywood director damien chazells incredibly fast and steady camera work throws you into these entertaining and visually spectacular musical numbers that end up leaving a big smile on your face the whole time youre watching it is visually stunning and the music draws you deep into the lives of these two starving artists who find each other and love the film undoubtedly deserves all the praise its getting and its truly one of a kind perfect all the way around,happy
what a memorable cinematic experience so far there are only three characters who have incredibly touched meemma roberts sally in the art of getting by amanda seyfrieds sophie in letters to juliet and this mia ini knew that the movie is more than great before i went to watch it i knew that musical always touches humans soul so well before i went to watch it but ive never thought that i would have an experience like this what can i say this film just gets you with dizzying skills those flashbacks those beautiful scenes those brilliant ideas they are artistically awesome and the last few minutes make you feel like this is a movie with two optional endings personally i prefer the second one but then it throws you back to the reality thats what life is isnt itlos angeles aka never is just a city it means a lot to thousands of people with dreams so do this movieawards will come to the movie and emma stone herself like a avalanche for sure due to that she is a fool who dreams and people love what other people are passionate aboutheres to the fools who dream not only about what you are eager to do but also the love story that you want to write in your own book,happy
people love what other people are passionate about being at the top of the quotes section i guess that statement had the most powerful resonance in the hearts of all the fools dreamers lovers who experienced with amusement and amazement this is not mia talking but damien chazelle hollywoods child prodigy though what he did is sure no childs workchazelle made a spectacular entrance with whiplash a spellbinding masterpiece exalting the virtues of work passion and discipline and by tying the oscarnominations record of titanic and all about eve makes exactly the point of whiplash the one missed by those who label it as a musical while you can enjoy it without even being impressed by the music although i find it difficult not to be mildly haunted by that score from justin hurwitz a melody echoing the work of michel legrand and that doesnt get off the head easilyheres to the fools who dreamfollows the upsanddowns of a romance between sebastian ryan gosling a pianist as passionate about jazz as jk simmons in whiplash simmons has a small part and mia emma stone a struggling actress stuck in cinderellaphase working in a hollywood cafeteria with a string of auditions failures that severely undermined her selfconfidence and while its easier for pianists to find jobs seb is a purist who cant stand selling his soul for pop music or any modernized youthappealing version of jazzbut theres no villain in except for reality and its necessary compromises together mia and seb find the motivation to achieve their dreams seb works with a band lead by keith an old friend played by john legend so he can provide for mia while she writes a onewomanshow and stops relying on auditions it is very telling that she wants to be an actress and he a jazz pianist mia must learn how to act and not surrender to defeatism while seb has got to play the game and as keith says not try to revolutionize something by being traditional the irony is that while they try to reach happiness theyre happy and have the time of their lifelife is what happens to you while youre making projectschazelle doesnt share john lennons view of happiness his vision follows the same pattern than whiplash to the point i wondered if chazelle wasnt the kind of workaholic guy who decided one day that he had to dedicate 100 of his time to moviemaking at the expenses of love comfort it seems like you can see his personal story behind his work and i feel that its for this sincerity that hes one of these artists who peak very early like scorsese or tarantino now i know i could go on the stylish directing and the whole love letter to hollywood but this is one aspect that im less hot aboutthe first sunny and enthusiastic dance sequence was nothing but a masterpiece of choreographic directing and time will tell if it becomes as iconic as the beginning of west side story but personally i was not impressed in the sense that i felt it was chazelle begging for the oscar especially since the scene doesnt stop after the music and the film goes on it was remarkable but in such a showy way it felt too oscarbaity for its own good but chazelle is a jazzy director he knows when to overbake it and when to play it smooth so i let myself transported by the film and at the planetarium sequence i was literally transported by the poetry of the moment like what the heck this is good give the film the awards it deservesyes is stylish and you can see the director and writers touches of unpredictability everywhere in the backgrounds in the use of phone calls even the title is a clever bit of creativity this is one of these cases where the directing is in symbiosis with the story like in scorseses movie and rightfully so because the story isnt even revolutionary and weve seen it a thousand times but its in the storytelling and that magnificent rewriting third act the finale redeemed the slower second act and echoed how many feel about life you can succeed through money love and dreams youre happy if you get two out of three by that logic mia and seb are happy at the end but indulge to a fantasy sequence where they succeed in everythingand as dreamy as it was the fantasy sequence was still plausible had they engaged in a transparent sincere and flawless relationship from the start but who said life was flawless i spend my whole life rewriting my story and asking myself what if i had done this or that its never totally unrealistic but thats the whole fantasy aspect about it when you know what awaited you its easier to look at your past in retrospect you only realize your mistakes when its you late otherwise you wouldnt call them mistakes and well five years later they still have good reasons to smile despite the wasted opportunities because when you sacrifice love for dreams the lost love becomes the dream cest la la vie finally speaking of life this is my 1000th review im sad that imdb is shutting down the message boards and wanted a feelgood movie for the occasion yet i felt cheated because chazelle doesnt go for sentimentality at the end as romantic and deliberately kitsch as it was is true to life because it has a little twist called reality i dont know if i feel so good after all i feel good in the way this film made me feel about life but maybe i wanted the dream after all,happy
1st review keeping it simple i watch a ton of movies and grew up on musicals including theateri just cant give this a big thumbs up i wanted to love it i really did id love to see a modern version of the old school musicals i learned yes learned to love its not singing in the rain and suchi love gosling as far as his talent i wanted it to work truly i did not come in being criticalit just never clicked for me the singing was blah i get the concept of being regular folks the story well i just kept waiting for it to be a big splashinstead it seemed to end quickly and simply bland i really did want to love it and understand the love for it sorry its my first review but ive seriously watched a ton of quality movies from imax to my home theater and this is the first time i felt i had to say my qualms its a fine movie for what it is however throw in the hype and it just let me downsure i could get more specific and such but i am just throwing it out there that it was a fail for me overall i wanted to love it it just never go going for medo a good old school musical where its the norm characters as they make them out to be then boom suddenly it rocks no not the genre of music i just think they let it drop where they could have taken it to another levellove the actors i am sure i will see tons of great works to come this just did not take it to the level i had hoped perhaps too much hype,happy
every once in a while i get to see a movie that makes me remember why i love movies i always appreciated people with passion and love for something they believe is greater than everything transient in our lives this movie is made by about and for people who share this feeling damien chazelle loves art emotions and especially music which of all artforms shows the most direct emotional response and damn he knows how to stage music perfectlyis now getting big buzz for the award season but in its heart its a small film with big topics visually stunning and heartbreaking emma stone and ryan gosling are the focus and you love watching them for every second of the movie without their chemistry and their individual charisma it wouldnt workas a male i have to admit that no man ever looked more interesting in a suit than ryan gosling emma stone as usual seems like the girl you easily fall in love with but you also can have a laugh and beer with in one of the first scenes where she acts as if she had to cryi really felt it just by watching her both actors transport emotions with simple changes in looks or facial expressions through the screen something that is highly underappreciated due to the fact that loud overacted performances cover them upgo see this movie even if musicals are not yours to watch you wont regret it,happy
i am not a musical fan to be honest and honestly saw this film cause hidden figures was sold out in ua sheepshead bay bk however which has gotten a lot of hype after their golden globe dominance turns out to be a beautiful work about the pursuit of ones dreams and what can happen on the wayla is the city of angels broken dreams and full of haunting old symbols of the golden age like griffith observatory the highways film lots etc the modern setting coupled with the music and cinemascope was brilliant and really established he films moodacting emma and ryan in my opinion were very good and their dynamic throughout this movie was astonishing the oscars would be a fool to ignore emmas performance which is brilliant in particular her breakdown after her onewoman play goes poorly or her work near the end both of which should get her a nomination reynolds is just as good and their chemistry lifts this movie through the good and in their argument scene where reynolds really captures the pain and frustration of doing something he hates but helps him survivenow is the dancing like kelly or astaire no and its clear both are not singers but they did a good job in my view with that and the music while its not aweinspiring really hits you particularly city of stars which is my pick for best original songflawsi was confused why simmons legend and dewitt did not really have more of a presence in the film to continue the storyline chazelle as building about dreams vs reality this hurts the movie because at times stone and reynolds journey was odd without more people in their worlds pressuring them to give up and conform which would have added to the films emotion also the opening wasnt that great and in the middle the film did kind of lag a bitoverall though the movie was good and did feature some magical scenes like their dance in the planetarium and in the magic hour overlooking the city chazelle really establishes himself as a director for his choices at capturing this city of hope broken dreams and melding it in a way mia and sebastians journey symbolizes not just other creative people but everyone who takes a chance to pursue their loves and faces all the heartbreak frustration and joy that comes along the waynow the last hr of the film in particular the ending is brilliant this movie is not dialogue heavy and stones eyes really capture her emotions as things begin to happen as does reynolds body which droops when hes down or viceversa when hes up those final scenes in particular the montage which reminded me of pixars up is the correct ending in that our dreams take us down different paths and we dnt always stay close to those along the way we remember their efforts that helped us make our choices and fulfill the goals we desire to my surprise is one of 2016s best films,happy
i had a bit of a dilemma at the cinema last week  go and see felicity jones get ill and die in a monster calls or go for some escapist nonsense instead it was a grey miserable january day so won it was pretty enjoyable too ryan gosling did a great job of being e ryan gosling pianist  keyboard player which is pretty cool in itself and emma stone was absolutely fantastic as his love interest one of her audition scenes reminded me of the incredibly powerful audition naomi watts does in mulholland drive and that might not be a coincidence judging froms locations ultimately a musical is going to stand or fall on the quality of its songs and im not sure these will pass the test of time but the whole movie was well done and a good romantic night out  unless you go along with someone you are not totally sure you want to spend the rest of your life with,happy
i was very much looking forward to being a fan of old hollywood musicals the likes of fred and ginger etc it was disappointing because it seemed like watching two different movies  the whimsical romantic comedy musical and the realistic gutwrenching dramathe beginning sets you up feeling like youre on cloud nine and you might even forget neither of the two actors can really sing or be remotely comparable to old musicals in terms of dancing ability and really its okay we dont need a technically amazing singing and dancing pair of actors because thats not what hollywood is like today the feel of the bygone musical era was there in and it was enough to make you feel good about lifeand then the feeling is snatched from you in the second half and you wonder what the heck happened its not even reality its pure old cynicism and in any other movie this would have been tolerated but a movie which set its mind up to be a delightful jazz tapping number its nothing short of a betrayalfor a movie talking of pipe dreams when does a dream become so fixed youre unwilling to compromise or look past it to make your life more enjoyable while some people find theres nothing wrong with staying constant and going after what you want some people understand lifes a little more dynamic and staying true to an original dream can be equally toxic its called adaptation im not sure chazelle was trying to be ironic or not with therefore i cant seriously recommend this as best picture or inspiring but i have to admit at least it presented jazz in a good light so yay to add acting is great music has a few haunting dreamy and often melancholic hooks to keep you humming along dancing is decent for todays hollywood ryan gosling and emma stone did a superb job especially gosling he stole the show with his pianoplaying performance and deserves whatever accolades he receives its just to my dismay and horror the story falls flat on its face and easily ruins the movie from becoming any greaterin summary this is the ultimate movie to test whether youre a romantic or a cynic turns out im not as much of the latter as i thought i was and therein lies the problem of being able to fully enjoy a big pity 610,happy
this movie from the start of the first scene up until the end of the credits is a love letter to old hollywood musicals and a tribute to classic jazzi love their stunning cinematography i love their magnificent soundtracks i love their captivating choreography i love their beautiful sets i love their passionate acting i love their charming scripts i love this movieif you could only see one movie this year make sure you watch this and if you could watch another movie watch this againthank you damien,happy
lived up to the hype of best film of the year with superb music and stupendous performances the movie explodes with color and creativity it expands our imagination without overstepping boundaries other movies in the past have done this as well but add in the extra effect of memorable music and terrific choreography and you have the motion picture hollywood has been craving for ages that finally captures the full attention of moviegoers other movies will need to step aside during oscar season and make way for this movie due to top performances by emma stone and ryan gosling not to mention the astounding cinematography i thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to end and what and ending,happy
i am completely blown away right now at what i just watched this is the best portrait of love and following your dreams ive ever seen in my life the acting is so good i felt as if the actors had transformed into the characters they were playing the music was phenomenal the cinematography is so beautiful i feel you need to see it in the theater to get the full effect of its prettiness the characters were so likable the script is so well written it makes me feel as if good scripts can still be written in the current state that hollywood is in and the story was so entertaining and beautiful that it had me holding back tears please dont miss this one guys,happy
is the best musical that hollywood has to offer for a long long time yes i split hair a basic characteristic of a broadway musical is that the music numbers are very much a part of the show in entirety with a pivotal function of advancing the story the motion picture screen however offers more flexibility has a story that is told first and foremost by the superb acting of the two leads the musical numbers augment but do not subsume their acting performanceif your movie viewing goes back to the 50s and 60s the opening frame with the once familiar cinemascope routine will right away grab your attention as you go along things from the colour palette of the picture to the unabashed ginger rogersfred astaire routine confirm the walk in retro land but make no mistake about it this is la of today when we live and die by smart cell phonesthe opening number another day of sun is set on a freeway using everything from steel band to hula hoop to skate board the ensemble of incidental drivers stuck in a traffic jam generate an energy level that reminds me of irving berlins theres no business like show business not a very good comparison i confess but you dont see them again in fact this movie has little by way of support cast jk simmons fans be forewarned  he is no more than a cameo emma stone and ryan gosling carry the whole show they are of course good enough but that is a gross understatement they are rivetingthe story is anything but original but it is in the telling and portraying that it shines they play two young people each with a passion for an art and a commitment for its fulfilment mia is a struggling actress struggling for six years going from one frustrating audition to another making ends meet by working as a barista sebs for sebastian predicaments are all too similar with traditional jazz as his passion but playing cheap music in a bar the trajectory is predictable they meet with a rocky start as usual they fall in love they move in together their cup runneth over with love then comes the reality of hard choice between love and careerwhat puts this story a notch above the familiar runofthemill fodder is that little additional depth the touring band he joins is rewarding both financially and emotionally applauses and all that but deep down there is the question of whether he truly likes the kind of music to which he has adapted himself what about his dream of opening a small jazz club for only purists she is always there to be his conscience challenging him and this works both ways when her selfconfidence is progressively gnawed away he is there to shake her up even when they have already broken up i am always gonna love you they say to each other but this transcends just romantic love it is an artist empathizing with and loving the passion and commitment of anotheri shall be negligent if i gloss over the musical aspect both of the leads are actors before singers and dancers but they are more than competent in these other departments the witty songanddance number a lovely night is quite a treat to the eyes and their rendition of the theme song city of stars golden globe nominated touches the heartthe ending sequence is a master stroke it is what the magic of motion picture can give you yes it can be done skilfully on stage too but not quite with the magic of the movie screen you emerge from the cinema with a kind of lingering bittersweet magic then back in reality you will say to yourself they are not doing too badly after all when you think of places like aleppo,happy
wow wow wow i have now seen this movie twice in theatres and i guarantee it wont be the lastwhere do i begin i had been anticipating this film for months the fact that it was written and directed by the same genius that brought us whiplash the talented actors involved the colour palette showcased in its trailers and the name itself it had me intrigued and i am so happy at how it turned out because this film exceeded my expectations and morethe opening sequence throws you in the deep end and takes your breath away with a statement prepare yourselves for an experience i was locked in instantaneously the choreography in this film is inventive and never lacking in energy or substance chazelle manages to pull off seemingly impossible shots of los angeles and has you begging the question of how able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped la has never looked so beautiful the editing the cinematography the directing is flawless and the movie presents this on a silver platter for the audience an absolute pleasure for the senseseveryone will tell you its a musical and on some level i agree but i see this film as a romantic comedydrama with music propelling the story to new heights the song and dance is so well infused into the narrative they simply whirl together into a delightful cocktail that sparkles with emotion in the form of emma stone and ryan gosling like whiplash the sound editingmixing is superb timing well with the score which is mindblowing the lyrics are intelligent clever and takes the audience seriously since it is key in progressing the plot the production design is stunning and encourages characters to flourish you feel as if you are dreaming on cloud and yet grounded in reality simultaneously a rare charming film only works when all the clogs link in harmony this one is clockwork the coupling of emma and ryan could not be more perfect they are oozing with passion and charisma and i never doubted their chemistry for one single moment the actors were able to shine brilliantly and i can see emma stone holding an oscar as she has several powerful standout performances from high to low and never fails to surprise which will cement her as one of the greats also gosling is awesome with some excellent comedic lines brought to the table one of the most important constructs of a film if not the most important is the story you are telling is this story original not particularly classic boy meets girl but the way of telling the story definitely is the choice to make this a musical love story was risky considering the hollywood of today is always concerned about making a blockbuster action hit but it paid off damien chazelle has a unique way of expressing his love for storytelling and his love for jazz which sets him apart from a lot of directors today as it opens our eyes to fresh experiences and makes it feel like one of a kind he is not afraid to play with the tropes that comes with this genre of film and that is daring i was astonished that the feelings and emotions accompanied with were still there the second time around the movie is full of sensations and is bursting at the seamsagain back to chazelle the same masterful control of pace and tension that we now come to expect from him is there stylistically the film looks and acts like a classic musical but often we see sudden hints that this is modern day modern cars phones etc to remind us that this is set in the present if we didnt have these reminders the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is based sixty years or more prior the opening of this film had me believing this old bw logos shot in cinemascope and it is clear that its a homage to the classics of which is it inspired but with a twistthere is scene where mia says she hates jazz so sebastian takes her to witness jazz live and shows her how he hears the music it is a riveting scene and when sebastian goes on about how exciting and new and creative jazz is i cant help but feel that it captures the essence of the film this along with the constant prompts of when it is set the film is aware of what it is and has metaphors embedded within the tale that kept me thinking well after the movie had concludedreignites a fire that had been lost from hollywood and rejuvenated the romancemusical genre its refreshing to see a totally unique film with surreal visuals and one that grasps the nature of hollywood and los angeles in such an unconventional manner the film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be chazelle steers away from the more clichd and predictable ending which might leave some on a slightly bitter note but he had the balls to flip the traditional finale on its head and leave us with strong messages imprinted on our mind opening the audiences eyes to the entire meaning of the story beyond the theme of follow your dreams to the idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them but life isnt a fantasywhen combining all these elements together you get one of if not the best film of the year left me speechless twice  it is one to be remembered and will go down as a classic in the many years to come it deserves all the praise it has and will receive well done and thank you for this masterpiece,happy
i havent lived in los angles in almost thirty years and was curious to see a movie about the present day city i was really quite surprised to find that there appear to be no same sex couples there not on the streets in restaurants and clubs at parties anywhere of course lack of lgbt representation doesnt make this a bad movie and the fact that there wasnt a hint of even a token lgbt character doesnt really mean much because other than the two lovers there werent any characters to speak of ok there was john legends who has about six lines of dialog and a big song that really has nothing to do with the narrative there was a sister what happened to her and the room mates what happened to them the restaurant owner i can think of two other musicals that rely almost entirely on the give and take in a relationship i do i do was a hit on broadway but that at least follows the couple over the course of fifty years a more recent movie the last five years probably has much more in common with but that movie rates a 59 on imdb and this one is currently clocking a stupendous 89my guess is that if the two main characters really connect with your inner daydream this movie will really resonate for you lets face it the notion that mia would somehow write a one woman show pull together the money to rent a theater and mount a production give up completely and return to nevada be called in by a director who somehow has the funds for a movie and a location paris but no script and presumably tracks her down to offer her both the lead and the scriptwriting all on the strength of one performance this is clearly daydream territory so be my guest dream on its just that i didnt particularly like either character and that leaves me being entertained up to a point by everything else the singing was ok the dancing too the music was ok the snappy production was impressive but i personally preferred the long live takes and the more realistic look of the last five years a movie that never got the hype that surrounds this one so that brings me back in a way to my original point twentyfive years ago newsies was a major studio relaunch of the classic movie musical i remember that it got some the worst reviews i have ever seen and bombed at the box office even now after selling zillions of vcr and dvd units and spawning an originally overlooked but eventually smash hit broadway production it only rates a 69 here could that be because it was directed by kenny ortega and features a cast of dancing paperboys and not the dreamy pairing of ryan gosling and emma stone so my point would be that is really awesome as the ultimate heterosexual movie musical of our time its not fabulous and it clearly doesnt want to be it traces its origins back to fred and ginger or gene and debbie but without the aid of edward everett and helen or donald and jean or any of the characters that helped to make those movies so memorable and so i would ask is that all there is,happy
just saw yesterday in imax and am glad i did this movie is a visual experience that must be experienced in the biggest screen possiblebut while i think its a good movie im sorry to say its not as great as many of the critics have said it isdont get me wrong i love musicals but it not in the same league as musicals like singin in the rain my favorite sound of music my fair lady and cabaret i even like modern musicals like moulin rouge though i know comparing one movie to another is wrong as each movie is different and unique but you tend to compare movies of the same genre raging bull vs rockypositives1 the direction is good2 performances by emma stone and ryan gosling are really good3 music is good4 cinematography is beautiful feels like a van gogh painting come to lifenegatives1 script is uneven first half is not engaging things improve post intermission but2 i wouldnt call this a negative but takes too much inspiration from movies like american in paris and a lot form french musicals like the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort wish it was a bit original thoughfinal thoughtswatch it at least once just dont have high expectations and you wont be disappointed my rating is four out of five stars,happy
i really do hate musicals as soon as people start singing and dancing in a series or movie i turn it off never watched through any musical movie or even an episode in a series it just feels so wrong and out of place i hate musicals down to a molecular level a musical must have killed me in a previous life or something i cannot explain itbut this this is something else its a masterpiece after a year of putting of seeing the movie i could no longer deny the imdb score 80 from 428000 people and the fact that this was also the writer and director of whiplash which i loved so i gave it a chance one eveningi was awestruckmy greatest regret is that i did not get to see it in the cinema with a large screen and with a great audio but at the same time it might have been best noone wants to see an adult man cry uncontrollably like a baby looking forward to damien chazelles next masterpiece,happy
i should say that i stopped watching after one hour that was enough the film still hadnt started apart from the fact that the music is mediocre the real problem lies in the lack of authenticity of the characters she is supposed to be a down on her luck actress and he is a down on his luck jazz pianist the trouble is they fail to portray this vulnerability because there is none of it to portray if you think about billy bigelow in carousel he puffs himself up and puts on veneer of bravado because underneath he believes hes a nobody in the end this is his undoing in the two main characters are emma stone and ryan gosling rather than the characters they are supposed to be portraying i dont buy into the characters at all she lives in a nice place they both have cars they go to nice places if they want to there is no sense of feeling disenfranchised or smashed by life there are no songs anything remotely like if i loved you feed the birds the sound of music high school musical is way better,happy
i wasnt sure if i was to like this as i tend to duck the hyped titles from hollowwoodwell the first act of three parts was perky enough to keep me in the evolvement of the story then the second act dropped the ball with a less than gripping conflict build up as jazz ambition is swapped for easier cash to me this was the least musical part as it circled this uninteresting part in an attempt to have real conflict of interest act three was a 15 minute montage that made a reprise of the developed story and the eternal question of what could have become if we down our path had the chance to choose over go into other direction and have a life that could have been the fulfilment we ought to have hadi thought this part was genuinely movingbut musicals are to be full of music yes  no  i was hoping a little for something closer to heart as i was swept by a chorus line and all that jazzthis was nostalgic and a little to bland,happy
this is a music video with even less of a story the story completely destroys itself in the end resulting in a movie with no point besides introducing a few songs that arent otherwise good enough for popular enjoyment,happy
i love ryan gosling i love emma stone i love them together but seeing them singing and dancing about love is almost vomit inducing,happy
tried so hard to be an epic musical from the fifties failed miserably ryan is only a passable singer and a wooden actorone wonders what the hype was all about and how desperate the academy was to nominate this film for an oscarnot a movie that i will be adding to my collection so that i can watch it again once was painful enough,happy
i expected way more pretentious and boring really liked the opening number even though i had to put subtitles on to see what they were singing about but it was not a representation of that the rest of the movie was like unfortunately youre stuck watching emma and ryan stumble their way through a movie with some bad vocal coaching and a very scetchy story line would not recommend,happy
is an attempt to make an oldfashioned blockbuster movie of the kind that gene kelly and frank sinatra used to make with modernday sensibilities its an interesting experiment and as somebody who is unashamedly oldfashioned i was looking forward to see how it turned out the end result is less than impressive however the film has a generic digital look and at times feels like glee the movie with overhearsed dance sequences and generic tunes only one repeated refrain makes the viewer feel anything ryan gosling is adequate as the male lead although i preferred him in drive but im afraid i found emma stone irritating and selfconscious,happy
i miss the days when hollywood didnt have to throw their shoulder out of joint patting themselves on the back for being hip and clever because they actually were hip and clever this movie is nothing more than two hours of tinseltown sniffing its own farts and trying to convince us that they smell like roses never have i heard such bland and uninspired music accompanied by a horribly pedestrian excuse for dancing the blueprint for how to do the perfect musical was laid down 64 years earlier in a little movie called singin in the rain  the filmmakers here seem to have learned nothing from that moviethe characters are shrilling and annoying the plot barely existent and the chemistry between the two leadswell it just falls flat i had high hopes for this movie but in this day and age of lowering the bar on just about everything i should have known it would be rated far higher than it deserved,happy
is just magical its funny heartbreaking inspiring and bold two great lead performances a beautiful beautiful score and breathtaking cinematography1010god bless everybody who made this film,happy
i cant believe it this is the movie that everyone is raving about how is this even possiblethis is a supposed to be a musical yet somehow the cast has been selected in such a way that the two people who do most of the singing are both pretty mediocre singers the story is boring and the point if there is one is rather disturbing what is this trying to say lets glorify leaving the love of your life for the sake of your career so that you can spend the rest of your life in misery and then eventually run into them one day just so that you can finally conclude you could have pulled it all off with them in your life and then go on being even more miserable for heavens sakedid everyone just get hypnotised by shininess of this movie and forgot that its actually pretty poor storytelling,happy
it may not have the depth meaning or questions that some seek in the seventh art but cinema is above all a spectacle and is absolutly that a visual and sonorous spectacle that has not been seen for a long time and will hardly be seen again this musical is not one of singalongs attests to this fact the existence of only 45 songs in a film of two hours so to speak but of music that is a constant throughout the film there are in fact 3 cast songs that are a little meaningless and sung in studio which not being to my taste ends ups being understandable as an appeal to the nostalgia of the old musicals that truth be told were the first blockbusters these three more flourished numbers occur in the first 20 minutes of the film and then what is in my view the best film of the 2010s actually begins the interpretations are excellent having the main actress more opportunity to shine in great height  the screenplay appears to be simple but develops in such a way that it looks like something of woody allen at his best a story about two people who fall in love and come together to achieve their dreams open a jazz club and be an actress but as i began to say is a visual and sonorous spectacle so that the technical characteristics of the film gain even more relevance the color of the film is extraordinary at every moment and the play of lights in each scene plays a decisive role in that which is transmitted the background cinematography is a luxury that makes of this a film of obligatory visualization in a theater as for the sound no movie ever sounded so good at any point in the film the viewer sits within the scene thanks to the sonic realism that transports anyone who is watching this play from the audience of a screen to the audience of a stage concerning music itself it is a constant and never below excellent playing an active role in the unfolding of events and not just a prop to the scene in this film the song is one of the characters and is so relevant that the only scene where it is not on stage gains an impressive dimensionbesideds all these attributes that are well above average is an immaculate directing effort that transforms this cinematic experience into an extraordinary journey through the imaginary of what is a relationship with love goals anger commitment happiness and sacrificeto finish i leave just one more personal note when the words the end appeared on the screen i had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud such was the feeling of immersion that the film caused,happy
as someone who loves classic musicals like singin in the rain west side story sound of music on the town and others i had low expectations for this film a film trying to replicate the joy and wonder that the old musicals brought to so many sounded absurd and would probably fail in its attempt i was wrongi loved this film it was a wonderfully fun and has phenomenal score to back the energetic dancing the production design can not be overstated with the oversaturation of colors to reflect the once brilliant la and when there is a conflict between the characters the colors become more pastel and faded the cinematography was amazing with a very fluid camera during dance sequences defying the stereotypical wide stationary shot that would include all the dancing and singing acting was great and included real emotion from ryan gosling that did not involve him eating cereal tldr takes all of the amazing aspects of the old musicals and broadway and compliments them with surreal emotion and storytelling must see if you enjoy musical theatre or looking for a film to watch and have fun 9610,happy
just watched a rerun on tv and returned to imdb to see what is the current rating and is surprised by the recent poor reviews if you havent watched this movie before do not be misled by the haters love the music and chemistry between the leads a great movie but still it cannot please everyone,happy
from the very first scene captures your interest in a vice and never lets go it was so magical visually stunning and the songs will stay with you long after you leave the theatre and despite being a musical when people werent singing and dancing it still had the feeling of a regular movie which made the story itself captivating i dont think emma stone has ever given a better performance than this she was good in birdman sure but she soared in one scene in particular that sticks out to me is the audition during which she was able to sing a beautiful solo while the camera circled around her all in one take on the contrary my only criticism is that ryan gosling wasnt doing much acting while he was singing and dancing he is a very gifted singer and a lovely dancer but his face remained a little deadpan during musical numbers but the whole movie is damn near perfect it was interesting storywise the music was fantastic it made me happy sad and made me dance in my seat but what really makes this movie to me is the ending sequence that was what made perfect it tied everything together so beautifully but also left some room for the viewer to do their own thinking and it even made me who has cried during only one other movie ever shed a tear is surely going to make cinematic history its new and exciting and its an experience you surely wont want to miss it,happy
i dont really like musicals but if you watch it more than 10 minutes it will come to appreciate it i can see how some younger views who are used to constant action wont like it but for those that like a good story this is pretty good,happy
cheerful and complete  a fancy opening with a realistic close  sweet dream music with charming tunes  damian chazelle is one hell of a genius,happy
i didnt expect to like this film in fact i actually closed myself off to the idea it wore me down from the first second and by the tenth i was in for the long haul to be clear you have to be in the prepared to let down the barriers and let te cheese engulf you its warm its cold its a copy and yet so original its a nod to the hollywood of old with an even bigger nod to todays audience yeah gosling is moody and yes stone is quirky but they have the depth of you read between the lines dont expect this film to spell out everything for you you should see a michael bay film if you need that,happy
i dont know what damien chazelle and justin hurwitz pured over this movie but since i first watched this piece of art ive been hookedi must admit that at first i thought this is a totally overrated movie but i was curious on finding that outnow after 4 times watching it in 3 months since christmas 2017 i can tell yougo and watch it you will certainly not regret it,happy
first of all let me just say this movie deserved every ounce of the oscar award for best picture it is a fullpackage in music cinematography story and production hands down best movie of the 21st century i doubt any movie or musical can come close to this one in terms of its connection to our human emotions even though mia and seb did not end up together they are still happily successful in their lives so i do think it is a happy ending in a way despite the melancholic epilogue scene seb and mia are both happy living in harmony with career and family she might not have the true love she had with seb with her husband but she seems very much in love with her husband if they restore the relationship they once had their lives would become disorderly once more somehow everything fits at the end and thats how life is its all about the timing i will keep watching this movie from time to time to remind me how much having a dream is important and how the flame really can save your life,happy
now as most of you know i dislike musicals randomly bursting into song is just not to my taste at all then came along and i consistently read overrated boring and snoozefest by most amateur reviewers after literally just watching this i can confidently say instantaneously is phenomenal oh my word i love it when im wrong and i was so wrong about this i cannot fault it i have fallen in love with you could say ive gone la la for it where to even begin this isnt just a musical this is a homage to classic cinema an endearing tribute to all those silver screen masterpieces that have moulded hollywood to what it is today dive beneath the glossy surface and i found myself experiencing a story about fulfilling dreams pursuing passions and just live life to its fullest it evoked pure joy from me genuine happiness i have never smiled and teared up simultaneously to a film before ever yet damien chazelle went and only done that his direction was absolutely outstanding from the gorgeous long takes to the vibrant colour usage he deserved every award emma stone and ryan gosling both gave magically enigmatic performances particularly the former who mesmerised me with her solo audition performance the choreography during the dance sequences defines classy imitating the classic pairing of fred astaire and ginger rogers the soundtrack will be instantly downloaded city of stars and mia  sebastians theme were the highlights the production costume and sound design were all perfect the dimming of the lights to focus on the characters felt refreshingly revelatory urghhh i think im in love this is why i adore the medium of film to capture the magic of a whirlwind romance in a joyous perspective it is undoubtedly rare to watch a film in this calibre i never thought i would say this butgets the perfect rating damian chazelletwo for two congratulations keep it up,happy
everything is perfect in this movie the first time i watched it i was really touched and i just felt that the director was drawing the scenes like painting the music talks to you the cinematography is absolutely fantastic the movies perfect for those who believe in love and those kin of romantic stuff briefly its going to be really hard to get something negative from this movie im still wondering why it wasnt selected the best motion picture in 89th annual academy awards,happy
this movie never fails to make me cry the choreography acting visuals and music blend together so wonderfully i encourage everyone to go see this accurate portrayal of entering show business and the sacrifice of love for the pursuit of your dreams stone and gosling are adorable together but part ways so they can chase two different passions acting and jazz we as an audience see what they couldve been if they remained a couple and had a child however what truly makes this film magical is their support of each other in their separation watch with a box of tissues,happy
despite the very obvious contrivances i enjoyed this film lets face it films where two people singing loudly in one anothers ear is not realistic but often we find wed like the world to be more like that  look at the opening routine in response to traffic congestion for examplei sympathise with the desire to popularise jazz which at its best is wonderful music but all too often sounds like a combo all playing different tunes or the same indulgence as much late 60s progressive rock where the performers take a long detour so each instrumentalist can show off what they can do with the instrument for me music is essentially melody and anything else tends to be just showing off which is why so many young singers oversing songs today i also find the ethnic ownership battles foolish veering on repugnant the beatles and michael jackson didnt produce music for white or black people they just produced great music that could be enjoyed by anyone who appreciated the style so the backlash against a white guy trying to save jazz and rejection of the film in favour of a much inferior one that had the right skin tone it might be considered in some spheres to have introduced homosexuality to the black audience but i think thats ludicrous the guy wasnt gay he was just grabbing onto affection in the one place he found it  in every other respect he followed the black cliches of drug trafficker with gold teeth and flashy car really turned me off the whole oscars crapwith so many reviews im sure the major aspects have been more than adequately covered by others so i will limit myself to something that most people who ive talked to about this film have overlooked in relation to the ending of course we all well most people surely wanted them to get together in the end but what i really liked about the ending and those ironic smiles is that  because they truly loved one another  they were really pleased that each had followed their dream and achieved it and thats what love is all about  putting somebody elses wellbeing and success ahead of our own desires sadly those desires are far too often expressed in a desire for ownership and control of the other person who needs to be constrained within our shadow thats not love thats slavery so it was wonderful to see this film rise up above that and send out the positive message of following our dreams and translating our love into helping and encouraging others to follow their dreams too,happy
in 2016 writerdirector of whiplash damien chazelle scored big at film festivals and theaters during the holiday season with one of the biggest hits of 2016 regarded as a luscious tribute to musicals of the 40s and 50s this film has become a critical darling and audiences have warmed up to it ever since it played theatrically in december 2016 not only that but it broke a new record at the golden globes by winning almost if not all the categories from best motion picture in the comedy or music section to best actor and best actress to best director to best screenplay etc while the movie is still a phenomenal piece of art its also the perfect movie to watch on valentines day how is it better to watch it on that said holiday as opposed to just any other day well its quite simple really the movie is a romanticdramedy about two struggling artists sebastian wilder ryan gosling and mia dolan emma stone the former is someone trying to bring traditional jazz back to the modern day crowd whereas the latter is an aspiring actress who comes close to giving up from failed audition after failed audition after several dates and discussions about the magic of motion pictures music and acting mia is convinced to make her own play and even do more auditions where sebastian gets a gig with a hiphopjazz group that soon become a hit the perseverance from these two can really make one root for them as their dreams are quite common to several artists who just want to entertain and do what they love even with countless struggles and failures its best to not give up for you will still rise like maya angelou even when you feel like theres no point while their relationship does have its troubles its meant to be a more realistic yet intriguing approach to two artists learning about each other their passions are what really give the movie its heart and soul both in style and in substance the aspiring musician and aspiring actress may have different views of entertainment but theyre still artists who care about making a difference nonetheless  mia and sebastian have a lot of chemistry together while mia is more into theater and acting than music or jazz sebastian shows her how jazz musicians speak thru their instruments whether it be from their practice or improvised performances when mia gives sebastian a tour of hollywood movie sets thats where they begin to express their passions to each other and begin to warm up as a couple sebastian advises mia to make her own play but that doesnt mean he can be there with his fame and music gigs the real emotional side of the film lies in the conflicts between their passions due to their passions being different their moments of glory sadly intertwine their relationship and it even toggles their hopes for getting their own careers in the first place as my 12th grade creative writing teacher once said as old fantasy hollywood musical as it seems its also realistic in its portrayal it doesnt always work out thats why the emotions of the movie really pay off it deals with something many people may go through just because one has a decent career going for them doesnt mean they can always be with their loved ones and thats where the realism in the romance angle pays off love is not like a disney picture as its more complicated to sustain for some but the heart from both characters are still there and caring is what got them their dreams in the first place and then theres the films tribute to classic jazz theater drama and broadway and musicals of the 40s and 50s the musical numbers were composed by the films composer justin hurwitz with lyrics written by musical theater composing team pasek and paul and they really understand the beauty and amazement of broadway and motion picture musicals the musical numbers from another day of sun to someone in the crowd to the oscar winning city of stars bring out the movie its upbeat whimsical and timeless feel that will make this film worth being up there with classics like singin in the rain and west side story that would really make people dance in their seats the fools who dream really creates an emotional and character driven arch for mia as well the singing from gosling and stone is nothing fantastic at first especially with the song a lovely night but it warms up as the film goes on and it fits as they build up to persevere in their dreams and to support one another the planetarium segment is pure visual delight and is pretty referential by trying hard to refer back to those old hollywood films stated creative writing teacher but the one musical number that really shines throughout the continuation of the film is mia and sebastians theme as it progresses the optimistic tone of the film while giving ryan gosling a real showcase of his piano talents dont be surprised if you find a lot to enjoy in terms of the musical numbers let alone dancing to them but i think the main reason this film is the perfect film to watch on valentines day is not only because its a love story but its a more optimistic and hopeful one since this film is about two rising entertainers who despite constant struggles and dilemmas still make it big one way or another it ends up being quite relatable to anyone who started off struggling at the bottom before making it to the top the determination and bravery mia and sebastian have really sells the movie and the theme of never giving up and always finding support really pays off support is the best thing anybody can use when trying to make a name for themselves and thats why its best to not look down upon your closest friends when they help you make it somewhere everything happens for a reason and thats why the film feels like such a love letter it says that you can still make a living out of whatever passion you have just as long as you dont forget about the ones that helped you get there complete with a special ending of realization and wonderment at the end that wont be spoiled take it upon yourself to view this optimistic and bright feature with your soul mate anytime you choose,happy
its as if people nowadays just want to see a movie that sticks to a formula that is so overplayed and cliche and predictable is it so hard to enjoy a movie that is both mainstream and different from the movies that everyone has seen so many times usually in a romantic comedy movie it plays out like this1 theres a boy and a girl2 they are so different and have different ideas and values that theres no way that they can be compatible3 turns out they can be4 they start to slowly fall in love despite their differences5 their differences all of a sudden causes an argument this is what makes the movie reach its climax6 the couple splits up seeing different people that are more suited to their values and beliefs7 turns out they miss each other8 they fall in love the endthis movie does not follow that formula it is such a beautiful and at times heart wrenching film about a boy who is an ambitious jazz musician and a girl who is trying to make it as an actress and they fall in love but their dreams and goals puts their temporary phase to the testits a real movie about real people and real things happen to them theres no big fight sequence to make the movie interesting theres no deus ex machina that makes everything ok it is about these characters who are trying to reach their goals and in doing so they end up parting ways and this is what seems to make people get super mad about the movie the happy ending is not what the viewers had in mind it drives away from that typical and cliche ending and goes somewhere that not many film makers dare to go this is the primary reason to the movies gorgeousness and realness on top of that the cinematography is enough to make you cry there are some amazingly shot scenes that just take your breath away ryan and emma are absolutely stellar they have such an amazing on screen chemistry that it makes their doomed ending all the more heart breaking the music is another things that makes this movie so different its jazzy its sometimes bluesy it is a genre that is not common in modern musicals modern musicals are so poppy and generic and something that has been seen time and time again so this movie moves away from that tackiness and thats why it gets hated so stupid i could go on and on about why this movie is perhaps and absolute triumph in 2016 but there is no point as a lot of the special snowflakes who try to hate mainstream movies will thumb this review down,happy
it took me a while to finally watch this critically acclaimed massively popular iconic movie and after watching it i just cant believe this movie was nominated for an oscar and nearly won best picture of the year remember that hilarious unforgettable mistake before i watched it i had heard all the backlash and people hating on it for all its awards and popularity and i was like oh im sure this movie is really good and people are just jealous of its popularity i love musicals so i thought i would easily like it and while i was watching it i was trying to enjoy it but i couldntthere were only about two things i liked about this movie 1 its colorfulness it has such beautiful cinematography 2 the acting is pretty good a lot of musical numbers and scenes seemed to be inspired from older musicals and i think it was cool that they were trying thatbut the movie was very slow and at times quite boring there were times while i was watching it where it really made me feel depressed and i just wasnt feeling the passion in the music it lacked something that other musicals have i just wasnt feeling the music in this musical it wasnt really making me feel anything and something always felt missing city of stars was a little catchy but thats about it and the ending i understand they were trying to be different and basically say that things dont always go the way we plan them to but still it ends with them staring at each other it should have ended with them dancing and singing together happily i had such high hopes for this movie and i think i can understand why other people might like it but i also understand why it got backlash and i cant believe it almost won best picture of the yearit feels strange and weird that i rated movies like pitch perfect higher that have way much less depth than but idk it seems to me they have something doesnt at least they have happy endings i gave it 4 stars for the decent acting and colorfulness,happy
most overrated everit sucksthe actors are average dancers and singershollywood promoted it as a greatest musicalit is a con job by the hollywood,happy
as a movie junkie of all types i watch just about everything to the end i think we had to leave dumbo when i was a kid because i was crying so hard but thats about it it took me three settings to get to the middle and then i couldnt go on nothing the movie gave me nothing it was completely boring that i couldnt make it to the end im a boomer who likes action thrillers love stories you name it one of siblings said she white knuckled it to the end but it was miserable so i know that im not alone i was shocked at what a disaster this movie is bored me to death,happy
im not a fan of musicals but with all the rave reviews i thought i should at least watch it before turning my nose up i guess you have to be a fan of musicals or a fan of one of the actors i was neither sebastian ryan gosling is a piano jazz player insisting on playing only pure jazz but finds the lure of the dollar to hard to resist mia emma stone is a struggling actress working as a barista in between auditions they fall in love just as their careers take unexpected turns as for me it took to long to get into the story but it did keep me intrigued as to where would sebastian and mias careers take them would they stay together would they break up and then get back together good movie for the teen girl sleepover,happy
starts with a beautiful number a single shot with a wide depth of field perfectly choreographed scene that includes dance song and capturing the life color and excitement that hollywood inspires we then follow mia into her world of being an aspiring actress going through lines with her a failed audition and everything that follows with that disappointment her friends encourage her to go out and try to find someone in the crowd to help her make it big in the famous world but it does not happen yet she meets sebastian when walking home from a party that she doesnt feel that she belongs we find that sebastian is a jazz piano player who wants to open his own jazz club and preserve real jazz when hes in the middle of a song mia is drawn to him as if it was the song that speaks to who they are and how their life will change throughout the movie as she continues to audition you can see that every time she changes and moves into a deeper sadness which she feels that she will never be able to become famous he finds that no one is interested in pure jazz anymore and has to change himself and his dreams in order to survive in this harsh hollywood world an over encompassing explanation of this movie is its about two people who discover themselves and their fame while being together but ultimately live different lives away from each other the introducing scene is a very tonal with high contrast block colored costuming which allows the characters to stand out on the busy highway the music however the instrumental overpowered and was mixed higher the vocal this diminished the quality of the song making it forgettable as the music progresses the plot of the musical it distracted from the main goal the musical has formalistic traditions due to some impossibilities of the scenes for example when mia and sebastian dance in space during the planetarium scene and the epilogue there are many realistic styles that are within the movie but it heavily relies on formalism as realism tries to preserve a fact of an unmanipulated film while musicals do not follow the ideas of preserving the reality of it due to song and dance in formalism the subject matter is very important to the plot and self expression which is portrayed using song dance and color this stylized reality makes a magical enchantment that is far from real life problems and expresses it through song dance color and lighting through lighting many concepts are portrayed many scenes within the movie include a deep focus high contrast dark out focusing on mia during intimate moments showing her true passion this use of high lighting shows a deep contrast between the world and her many times lighting is used to illuminate the faces of the characters to portray feelings thoughts emotions and actions for example during the fight scene between mia and sebastian their faces are illuminated by a yellow light but there is a dark green background behind them these colors are fighting each other using contemporary colors and this tells the viewers how they should feel in this moment another example is when mia first hears sebastian playing their song hes in the building shes outside listening in and a red light illuminates her face showing the romantic side of the movie and their relationship that is soon to come there was a large use of lighting and darkening during the movie mainly the use of silhouettes during the epilogue color such as blue yellow green and red was very important in the film using the bright colors to bring out the characters the colors bring out the expressive emotional and atmosphere parts of the movie during mias audition song blue hues are displayed to show a relaxed calm and natural feeling set on the characters and the viewers while warm colors such as red yellow and orange express aggression violence and romance shown during fights and loving times between mia and sebastianoverall although the movie had strong characters a put together plot and music which is my favorite thing the movie didnt meet to the potential or the expectations that everyone made it be the songs werent memorable which in a musical is a huge drawback of the principle of a musical personally i believe that the movie was good in the moment and as youre watching it it brought entertainment and joy but only in the moment the movie didnt make people think didnt have people singing the songs after the movie ended it didnt have anyone talking about it although many of the characters had beautiful voices i believe the actors were chosen due to their fame rather than the talents they possessed emma stone has a beautiful lower register but most of the songs she sung were in a higher register causing her voice to weaken sound breathy and made her seem not confident ryan gosling has exceptional dancing skills as he has danced his entire life however his singing skills needed improvement with tone phrasing and breath support there was so much hype that two actors were brought back together again crazy stupid love in a pairing that many people enjoy that it overshadowed any other chance to have two other stars who had the vocal lyrical and acting perfect for this musical this movie had various good pieces to it but the pieces that needed improvement overweight the good pieces creating a film in my eyes needed many changes,happy
the film is a story that is carried more by color and music than plot or characters that is not to say that the plot or characters take away from the film by nature musicals tend to compromise character traits and logical scenes for visuals and song people do not just randomly break into songs or dance to choreographed music it is difficult to create a musical because the songs should further the plot fit the characters and not feel too out of place this film does a decent job of matching the characters songs to their personalities but i believe that the focus of this movie lies with the colors the colors in this movie are widely varied both in locations and outfits mia the main character wears several different dresses throughout the film these dresses vary wildly in color and appearance the purpose of the dresses appears to be mostly aesthetic giving mia an outfit that would compliment the rest of the scene and make her stand out is a film that focuses heavily on aesthetics these dresses are used in conjunction with several scenes where the lighting changes to emphasize a specific color this is used to convey emotion as well as pull the viewers attention to mia and her actions during these scenes scenes with dramatic lighting like this often end up showing more emotional aspects of the story as a musical how a character moves and looks is incredibly meaningful to the story some of the most striking examples of the use of color include when mia and sebastian meet at the moment sebastian is fired and when mia and sebastian argue over his dreams there are also several scenes that use color together with a low lighting such as when mia enters the bathroom walks home or sings for her recital these scenes all take advantage of color to highlight both the characters and the atmosphere another aspect that this film takes advantage of is the movement of the characters and camera it is not just the dancing that is eye catching although that is one of the main uses of movement utilized by the film when mia and sebastian first enter the observatory the camera spins around displaying the room this eventually leads to a dance in the star filled observatory itself where the characters appear to be dancing among the stars i am sure that this is a reference to something although i am not sure what this film is very much a product of its time it is full of references to other movies both through the parody of specific scenes and the characters directly mentioning other movies of the time i believe that a portion of what endears this movie to people is the nostalgia of remembering great movies of the past this is not inherently a bad thing but younger members of the audience who may not remember such movies will not be able to receive the full experience the film was designed to provide the plot of this movie is relatively simple the main characters fall in love and decide to follow their dreams end up failing and break up only to seize the chance to follow their dreams again one interesting feature of the film is that while both characters are able to realize their dreams these dreams cause them to part ways effectively ending the romantic plot as they each go to live their own lives there is a happy ending but it can be seen that they compromised their relationship for the sake of their dreams it is possible that they could have made everything work out perfectly but i think such an ending would be much less satisfactory and that their ability to each pursue their own dream to fruition is what makes them such likable characters,happy
is well made cinematographic experience that really leaves a great first impression the main characters mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling are likable quirky individuals who are down on their luck but striving to make their dreams reality both characters have big aspirations but not a whole lot of direction as throughout the movie they struggle to make their dreams a reality all while dealing with the issues that come along with having a relationship the story also moves fairly quickly and is good at making the audience connect with the characters emotions which allows you to get easily invested in the characters and the movies plotthe film also does a very good job at using lighting and color during specific conflicts to make them seem more intense spoiler warning there is a scene in the film where mia and sebastian get into a fight which ultimately destabilizes their relationship to the point where they end up separating not too long afterwards the scene itself though is very smartly set up the two main characters are eating dinner together by candlelight so the room isnt brightly lit but the yellowish light from the candles blends very well with the lighter green that the room is colored yellow and green are analogous colors which tend to make people feel very relaxed and comfortable so a few minutes into the scene when mia and sebastians argument ensues and escalates quickly it comes as a bit of an emotional shock as your initial impression of the scene would make you think that it would be a bit more melancholy than it turns out to benow while this movie does leave a great first impression it falls flat on any subsequent views the first time i watched this film it was very emotional and i loved the characters the dancing the music everything in the film made me love ithowever when i watched it a second time with a friend everything fell flat like really flat the story then felt extremely rushed and clich as well as there are so many characters that are introduced just to be thrown away a few scenes later an example of which would be mias roommates who seem important when introduced only to disappear after the first 15 minutes only to return briefly for 2 more scenes much later in the filmnot only this but some of the character conflicts also felt pointless as they did not contribute to the plot or felt like they felt forced just so the plot could actually progress also much of the musical score felt really forgettable outside of the opening piece another day of sun and the piece with john legend we can start a fireallinall the film is a great experience just dont expect to enjoy it the same way if you end of seeing it a second time,happy
i am a big fan of hollywood musicals from busby berkley ones to hedwig and the angry inch from the directors choreographers and dancers like astaire kelly caron fosse dandridge charisse rivera nicolas brothers tune moreno etc even little shirley temple the ones done back in the day and some of the more recent ones which is why i cannot express my disappointment in watching so much so turned to another premium channel that showed the late artists princes sign o the times which hadnt been shown in 20 years and found that more on track for a tip to stage musicals than and let me add i was not a big prince fan and i know this was a concert stage film of one of his recordings more than a musical so this is making a pointtells the old tale of a struggling jazz musician and budding actress in los angeles trying to make it yes youve seen it over 100 times and this is just one more telling they run into each other at meaningless but hoping to get discovered while making ends meet hollywood functions they are at theyre dreamers in the land where dreams can or may not come true los angeles  or a reasonable facsimile thereof one of the biggest problems is that i found the leads eh  no spark for me between the two no real heart for me between the two no reason to make me want to root for their success or failure whether they were in los angeles or anyplace elsethe production numbers are eh the music is  eh the dancing is eh the story is  eh and eh seems perfect for this eh generation that seems to want to like anything that is a waywatered down or blatantly copied oops sampled now called homage version of something that was done infinitely better beforethe emphasis on colors throughout this film are like the colors on products from the price is right  bright attentiongrabbing and staged to where you want to buy them where you can find them but i didnt buy into this want to see good musicals with bright colors bright music boy meets girl and dancing bollywood has done it better much much much better and i am as american as applepie mind you i just love musicalsfor example bollywood films like jab we met or bajirao mastani or even cocktail are done much betteri would never compare to any the musicals of its past  they are classics and you root for the subjects tape your feet get transported to their world watch amazing choreography and whimsy  even in the more tragic of musical tales so is a homage to the old musicals tries to be however just didnt work for me,happy
absolutely terrible what is going on how could this dreck possibly win all these accolades there is nothing there nothing the music stinks the voices stink the story stinks the dancing stinks it just stinks it bears no comparison to the great musicals of the past it pales compared to west side story show boat my fair lady south pacific singing in the rain american in paris what would gene kelly say if he saw this drecklook it up if youre not bicoastal i needed an immediate antidode of 5 minutes of mgms thats entertainment after watching this dreck maybe this is a joke made by woody allen or mel brooks yeahyeah is the new springtime for hitler,happy
what happens when you mix the story of underdogs with a broken love story  oscars  huge collection and blockbuster sales for tissuesthe movie will make you feel like you are watching a classic but when you keep going towards the end you will see how its a template of several movies we have seen with a collection guaranteed story lineexcept couple of scenes especially the city of stars scene by ryan and his acting towards the end when he sees emma for the final time i feel most of it was stock hollywood drama and predictable play of our emotions the biggest positives are stellar performances by emma and ryan which makes it watchable but imo its definitely not worth the hype of oscars or the legendary status that is being made of it,happy
was the toast of the town this past awards season earning scores of nominations and six academy awards but while critics loved the film to death and most of the moviegoing audience was cool with it too theres no denying that its a schlockfest thats high on itself and its pretentiousnessdespite this clearly benefits from the vision of damien chazelle who recognized an opportunity to bring back the musical genre in a way that hearkens back to films from decades ago from the opening freeway sequence to the many impromptu songanddance moments scattered throughout theres a lot of commotion going on this musical whiplash might be interesting to some but it can be very jarring for those who are not bonafide fans of the genre even though these musical numbers might seem somewhat all over the place they are actually a useful device that help guide the audience through the story between two struggling los angeles transplants ryan gosling and emma stone while annoying city of stars is the song that acts as a needle that threads everything togetherbut yes is basically the gosling  stone show both are major stars in their own right and together they do bring a good deal of chemistry to the screen but when a film relies too heavily on its leads it can have some weak spots in other areas for this includes the fact that theres pretty much no supporting cast john legends role is an elongated cameo and theres really no there there for a plot sure the somewhat straightforward progression of the film is thrown for a loop in the climax which is refreshing but its still not the mark of a firstrate filmmay not have won best picture but it won enough critical acclaim that was mostly based on what some were hoping the film could be not what it actually was its not the worst thing to come out in 2016 but its also far from the greatest,happy
la la lend is one of the most boring and stupid movies i have ever seen in my life im not big fan of musicals so maybe my bad rating is because of iti stopped watch it after half an houri just didnt want to spend my time more on that movieactors are bad toothere is no chemistry between themu cant feel love between them just u can see only bad acting if u wanna my suggestion i will say better dont waist time on itthere is so much better movies then these one and about oscars i cant believe that these movie was nominated for oscar these yearits just unbelievably,happy
i could not believe my eyes  this is definitely not a movie it is set after set of moving pictures of places people and other stuff  it has no story other than the contrived done to death they hate each other no they love each other game that the two obnoxious leads play and it leaves you bored angry and sleepy at the same time my sister forced this tripe down my throat and i could not believe her  actually after it was done i asked her what have i done to you  other than having not plot and being so pretentious and boring and infuriating and self indulgent at the same time this ah movie was a merely a pat on the shoulder given to hollywood by hollywood  we are forced to feel sorry for the stars of hollywood cry as they sacrifice their love for their success and feel sad all i felt was boredom and anger as i was constantly awakened from my sleep by the main actress screeching i would not call it singing that would be an insult to the professionor the main actor yelling the thing is bright colors and nice editing is nice enough but i have the firm belief that movies need a nice coherenttouchable storygood actorsoscar was given to emma whats her face   and chemistry not just between the main actors but also between the actors and the viewer  we have to feel as they feeland can put ourselves in their shoes watching this so called movie i felt nothing for the characters their dreams seemed to shallow as did their personalities and who cares if these two loved each other or were just around for the sake of not being alone for the moment conformist to the bone and really boring,happy
the movie was very normal i dont know why there was so much propaganda about it i was completely shocked when emma stone won that oscar her acting cant even get her a plastic award ryan gosling was good emma was good but not an oscar come on are they blind or something i wasnt really excited when i was watching the movie,happy
in january 2016 aziz ansari originated an snl skit where he is interrogated at a police station for insufficiently adoring i meani liked it i just didnt think it was ahmazing he protests what do you like if you dont like is the vitriolic bellowed response well youd better get my handcuffs ready a cynic would point out that every 35 years hollywood and its audiences remember the musical genre exists and fall rapturously in love with each new tentpole release as if its predecessors had never existed les misrables chicago okay ill stop im not cynical enough to dismiss outright as such but i am on ansaris team on this one damien chazelles follow up to his blistering whiplash is lots of fun its a boisterous sweet massively charming slice of cheese with a sloshing side order of nostalgia and it buys into its clichd pandering familiarity with such outrageous gusto its almost easy to forget how fundamentally vacuous it is so there you go lock me up and throw away the key like 2011s the artist its a glossy heartfelt riff on the overwhelming power of the classics here in a whiplash hangover jazz greats receive equal adulation to da moofies and how soulcrushing it can be to fall short in comparison its scorseses new york new york for the youtube generation if you will and this proves to be the films greatest asset and pitfall simultaneously it plays phenomenally in instalments chazelle is a whiz at conjuring moments of transcendental movie magic riffing on the whimsical expressionistic flourishes of the singin in the rain era bubblegum colours triumphant tap dancing floating through the air framed by a sea of stars and all linus sandgrens spectacular cinematography helps astronomically to pump up proceedings as the camera zips through parked cars swimming pools and past whirling dancers like a caffeineaddled hummingbird and that opening four minute long take crane shot has to be seen to be believed but for all these highs of spectacle come the crashing lows of the story gluing them together its immediately unshakably apparent that chazelles script is too flamboyantly nostalgic to offer much that hadnt already been done to death in the good ol days it cherishes and its a shame to see a movie directed with such pizazz be so well boring the title of course is a doublepun nodding not only to singing but crafting enough of a gushy love letter to the mystique and iconicity of la to make woody allen wince here chapelle trips over his own earnestness an aspiring actress meets a spurned jazz pianist verges on just a small town girl livin in a lonely world in the groan department and chazelle never musters up the gumption to deliver any reflexive reworking of the starcrossed loverartists formula whatsoever even the films fakeout happyeverafterbutatwhatcost ending a melancholic what might have been fantasy dance break is cheerfully poached from an american in paris among countless others making the films one seeming deviance from clich just as ensconced in clich maybe the la la is really chazelle retorting la la la i cant hear youthat said chazelles original tunes are more than worth their salt a handful of charming bittersweet earworms sure to light up itunes for months occasionally sly humour pokes through the polish  theres a great laugh to be had when goslings serious musician joining john legends popjazzfusion band meant to signify his artistic bankruptcy in favour of pop commercialism produces the films most infectiously memorable song still postwhiplash chazelles one true love is still jazz and the films jazz club scenes come alive with more kinetic ferocity than any of its schmaltzy dance breaks the nonprofessional singer musical trope is ultimately a matter of personal preference woody allens everyone says i love you takes this poetic accessibility to the next level but its effective here thematically underscoring the dissonance of these two good but not amazing dreamers slotting themselves into the iconicity of legend its a shame that theyre further marred by consistently murky almost distressingly amateurish sound editing garbling the audibility of most of the songs lyrics almost past the point of comprehension naturalism is one thing but its still hard to fall in love with songs we can barely hear still it takes appropriately glitzy stars to own up to such a superficially pleasurable film and its impossible to imagine a more lovable duo than emma stone and ryan gosling endearingly clumsy singing aside their respective astronomical charisma easily outperform their lessthanstimulating material underpinning her adorably neurotic klutz schtick with a smattering of raw pathos stones gigantic alien bug eyes prove capable of expounding almost alarming deluges of emotion hearing her showstopping audition ballad is so phenomenally moving that its almost hard to focus on her amidst brushing tears away similarly gosling proves hes able to look as winningly suave sporting a keytar and red leather jacket as ever and hes breezy smooth and funny enough to breathe life into his stale frustrated artist nonetheless restricting the superb jk simmons to a fleeting cameo borderline criminal offence its curious to see a movie so obsessed with history and nostalgia playing its spate of clich so unironically but is such a pleasantly dopey ode to the love of creation its evidently easy for many to overlook chazelles film is likely best enjoyed outside the spotlight of the awards hype machine where its easier to embrace its superfluous camp and profoundly heartfelt sweetness at face value still for a world so riddled with conflict and strife theres an unmistakable value for a film so silly  episodically on youtube if nothing else heres

critically acclaimed and currently totaling 14 oscar nominations 11 bafta nominations and 7 golden globe wins musical is not as incredible as you would expect myself and guest writer natasha tell you whyplot summarys centres on seb ryan gosling an overqualified restaurant pianist with a penchant for jazz and mia emma stone an aspiring actress lacking in successful auditions upon meeting mia and seb push each other to make their struggling dreams a reality and the movie follows how their relationship moulds as they attempt to reach their goalshe said damien chazelle director of clearly knew with this project that he was on to a winner but why did he have to make such a song and a dance about it with its dazzling aesthetic and charm it is difficult to imagine going home emptyhanded at this years academy awards particularly for costume design and cinematography emma stone clearly the star of the show i felt ryan goslings performance was not particularly special nor any of the rest of the cast bar stone for its praised musical elements certain shots and songs were overused at times  every other song it appeared would open with dimmed lights and a spotlight on the performer eye roll perhaps due to the overwhelming acclaim it has already received my expectations were set high  and was not the solid 1010 i had hoped it to be the plot itself wasnt overly ambitious and through all its glitz and retro glamour had an aura of arrogance despite being far from perfectshe said did i like of course did i love it hmm perhaps not with fantastic use of colour and costumer as well as a hint of bazluhrmannesque beauty in its shots and cuts the storyline and catchy songs kept my intrigue until the end but whilst i understand some of the hype i cant help but feel it could have been a little less pretentious this selfindulgent piece of cinema portrayed a bland ryan gosling some fairly odd pacing or total lack thereof and an unusual disappointing lack of chemistry between gosling and stone emma stone was breathtaking as ever  endearing gawky and not afraid to laugh at herself  but i felt paired with far too hollywood a role the films music think 20s speakeasy  parisian jazz cafe contrasted with blatant cheese whilst catchy was paired with some fairly mediocre singing and dancing the whole thing just seemed a bit unnecessary and its overzealous approach to the arts just reminded me of the movie midnight in paris fyi not a favourite of mine my final words overhyped but a fun ride,happy
everything about this movie is remarkable from opening number probably one of my favorite scenes ever to the final montage again probably one of my favorite scenes ever is a mesmerizing story about following your dreams the film starts with an energetic catchy and beautifully choreographed tune called another day of sun which really has nothing to do with the story but sets up the mood and the context from there we follow two main characters as they pursue their dreams together for seb a jazz musician for mia an actressla la lands most notable features are the music colors choreography and cinematography the music written by justin hurwitz perfectly fits and forms the mood of every scene i really have no complaints about any of the songs there are so many different hues of colors and each scene seems to have a different color scheme i dont know too much about dancing but to the extent of my knowledge the choreography is brilliant and entertaining though no comparison to gene kelly the cinematography strategically combines elements of both a golden era masterpiece and a stage play while also providing space to showcase the colors and musicthe actors try hard but to be honest i personally dont like any of the actors in this other than my personal distaste of casting i have no complaints of its a visual and musical masterpiece that i plan to watch many more times,happy
its been a long time if ever since a movie or anything else has left such an impression on me everything about it makes me happy it truly is masterpiece,happy
i got no words to describe this masterpice excellent performancesgreat score and music numbers and god that ending is great cant describe it in wordsand the poolparty crowd song scene is perfectly shot,happy
im keeping this review short and simple this is the movie that made me cried with ita pure acting and i know im little late watching this wonderful piece of art but this movie is simply amazing,happy
it wasnt an accident folks this one was truly the best picture,happy
this film was awarded multiple oscars and should be invested in the national film registry archive not a waste of your time and without spoiling the premise of the work definite engagement stage movie with your date as you two snuggle under the movie watching blanket and rejuvinate your the film does this in a geniune in the feels way not the cynicial perversion that is sappy romance money grabs this film is opposite of that and it harkens us back to the magic of the hollywood musicalschazelle the director will revive this necrotic cesspool of formulatic cash cow films,happy
damien chazelle returns to the filmmaking foray with a beautiful calming and surprisingly sad portrayal of aspirations and ideals in the cutthroat world of los angeles anyone who has had a passion or pursuit in some form or another will connect to this film immediately and the musical nature of the film only helps keep the fluidity moving,happy
watching is like going to a restaurant that everyone raves about we had high expectations the meal starts with rainbow shaved ice the food takes a while to come but once it does is good and just when you like it and are ready for dessert they bring out a bowl of hot and sour soup to finish off the movie took about 20 minutes to get into started to have good chemistry and likeability stalled with some twists and just when youre ready for the payoff ripped the carpet out at the end a story of love and hope that turns into my best friends wedding,happy
is definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen ryan gosling and emma stone do a great job as well as damien chazelle as the director i cant stop listening to the songs simply extraordinary,happy
this movie was incredibly boring none of the songs were remotely memorable in fact ive just finished watching the movie and i cant recall a single line from any of the songs within the film it dragged on and i lost interest pretty early oni dont quite understand the hype for this one theres no romance to be found just two unlikeable characters whose stories are ultimately pointlessthe best thing about this movie was the costumes,happy
the music was not memorable the dancing was not inspiring  the story was not that interesting  how on earth this won awards i do not know  pretty pathetic really ,happy
when the film started out it was so treacly awful that i was sure this was a gimmick that would be central to the conceit of the movie and the film does improve slightly on the introduction of the second main character about 15 minutes later but lo and behold the script continued to be quite mundaneits as if the suits behind the making of this film said just write a whatever script that will propel the setpieces that will kind of evoke musicals from 50 years agoscript is most important to me and all the other technical excellence in the movie just doesnt amount to a hill of beans by comparison,happy
is such a beautifully crafted and directed masterpiece showing us the highs and lows of ones dreams along with some of the best chemistry given on screen by ryan gosling and emma stone,happy
i hated the musical numbers they gave me migrane every song was just highpitched yelling people spontaniously dancing and acting like fools the choreography numbers was so boring i could not relate or feel emma stones performance she just doesnt have that starpower for me to keep me alert or feel anything ryan is always goodi never liked musicals and its a hollywood thing i never will never fully understand the chance for it to fail as a movie is huge because it looks so ridiculous when all the superhappy smiling yerks start dancing and jumping spontaniouslyit works well in some classics like wizard of oz because of the beautiful sad songs it works in nightmare before christmas because of the gothic aesthetics and dark fairytale balladsin moulin rouge cause kidman is so gorgeous you cant take your eyes of her it works in westside story and grease also because of the rebell teenage freedom the cars and the leather in all you got is dudes in suits that jump in pools like they are children ugly dance numbers where everyone just clowning around emma is uninteresting here i paused the movie 4 times before watching it through why people is hyping over this i have no clue it doesnt matter if the cinematoghrapy or the locations are beautiful when the movie itself is bad,happy
this is my alltime favourite filmthe performances the music the script the direction  its all phenomenal emma stone is in top form in the role of mia ryan gosling equally as good in the role of sebastiantheres so much to love with would highly recommend to anyone,happy
my rating  810is a feast for the senses  the music singing choreography cinematography locations are delightful and mesmerisinggosling and stone are perfect in their roles and its a joy to see them toetapping and singing in impressive long takesa colourful nostalgic romantic and utterly joyful film,happy
so boring we had to skip to the crazy plot twist at the end which was also boring,happy
i really love plot plot be simple and fluent i was not boring while i was watching but obviously we can see ryan gosling and emma stone do not good dancer and singers ryan goslings voice is really cool and suitable for many movies however his voice not able for singig in my opinion he did not have enough experience or education about singing emma stones voice is meets expections unfortunately her body shape did not adequate for dancing perfectly at least they have not terrible at the beginning of the movie i have seen lot of musical it has sometimes get boring and a few musicals have a little bit absurd but i have really loved end scene you can see this movie for just end scene i love this at all810,happy
from the opening sequence this film captivates the audience through the dancing and singing bringing to life the essence of the film in a couple of minutes a broadway musical on the screen makes you feel as if you are watching this performance live it really connects to the audience as its full of energy and passion it reminds the viewers of the beauty that is jazz music and reality of an actor and musicians dream of becoming successful and ultimately making a choice of what is more important to themryan gosling and emma stone had a strong chemistry between them adding to the overall believability and connection to the characters the film displays moments of comedy and changes to moments of seriousness rather smoothly the audience feels for the characters journey and individual growth as mia played by emma stone and sebastian played by ryan gosling pursue their passions for acting and music as they learn from each other who they are and what they want to becomethis film is my favourite musical movie as it cleverly uses jazz music in a modern and exciting way the cinematography of the pool scene reminded me of the party in the film the great gatsby with all the loud music and dancing adding to the atmosphere of the scene in both films i recommend this movie for those who love musicals and enjoy playing a musical instrument or just listening to songs as well as those who love acting and performing its perfect for the whole family and a great way to feel inspired and motivated to pursue your dreams and express creativitythis film will change the way you feel about jazz music and make you want to watch live concerts and shows it has many lessons about the reality of wanting to become a musician or actor as it teaches you that its all about learning to cope with rejection and to always look for opportunities and to never give up hope one day your opportunity will come you just have to push through the knock backs and be resilient problems may arise on the way as foreshadowed through the opening sequence song another day of sun which talks about mia and sebastians journeys throughout the film but at the end everything works out for the best no matter what they choose in the end it doesnt always mean whats more important to them but what they need in that moment,happy
i am guessing there is already a lot of reviews here that talk about plot setting acting etc so i am only going to tell you one thing however cheesy this may sound made me feel everything happiness and sadness hope and hopelessness whenever i see the title i instantly want to watch it again the only reason i do not is because i want to forget it first so that i can experience it the first time again,happy
this is my favorite movie ever i love everything about it the cast is perfect the songs are amazingly written and performed and the setting is beautiful when i first saw this movie i wasnt expecting anything special i was absolutely wowed i am not a huge fan of musicals but this totally surprised me first of the plot is really interesting it follows more of a real life path with the couple not ending up together like it does in almost every other movie this feels more accurate which makes the movie so much better second the songs are amazing i could have listened to the playlist over and over again there is a huge focus on jazz which is performed beautifully in so many different ways not just elevator music also the stars do an amazing job singing especially since neither of the two main characters didnt start their career in singing john legend is great too for his first real acting debut and light a fire is performed really well the movie starts off with a music number another day of sun which is choreographed and filmed perfectly next all of the shots are amazing with scenery that really fills up the set the lighting is also breathtaking with one scene in particular which is breathtaking everything about this movie is perfect,happy
pros the entire soundtrack the directors commentary emmas oscarwinning role john legend being a voice of reason didnt think ryans voice was that terrible reminded me of chet baker glad i gave it a second chancecons the only thing that bugged me was sebs snobiness even when i first saw the film,happy
i only got half way through this film so i cant give an overall opinion however what i saw was very dull i never turn off halfway through i wasnt overly fussed about watching in the first place but due to the hype and reviews i decided to give it a go the songs were not catchy at all you can barely understand the lyrics the beginning was also very drawn out and had a very bland storyline so much so i could not put myself through it anymore and didnt care about how it ended how this gets more than the greatest showman is beyond me,happy
this movie is truly spectacular the chemistry between emma stone and ryan gosling is super great music dancing and story its a homage to the astairerogers movies of the past loved this movie,happy
sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone against all odds keep running into each other very often at first sebastian didnt pay mia much attention but mia felt the energy when she saw sebastian perform at a wedding the two are quickly drawn together because they have the very same desire to reach their dream sebastian is an aspiring musician and mia an aspiring actor so they are very much alike in the sense that they have a goal that they arent pushing themselves to reach they built a bond and fell in love with one another but there was still the desire to reach their goal of becoming a musician and an actress very briefly they both settled on being in a relationship and working jobs just to get by but sebastian got an opportunity he couldnt allow to pass by sebastian joined a band as a pianist with an old friend and had to leave mia alone during this time it made sebastian realize he could still pursue his own dreams and he got the courage to push mia to obtain her goals they were faced with the ultimatum of being committed to their relationship or allowing each other to move on so they could give their dreams 100 in the end they both ended up succeeding in what they love but it meant giving up their relationship the theme is the movie is making sacrifices if that will lead to true happiness though mia really loved sebastian and didnt want him to go on tour she knew he needed that to feel whole again even though that meant being apart from him for long periods of time she was willing to do that so he could reach his dreams the theme was allowed reflected when sebastian pushed mia to go to that audition even though he knew it could potentially end their relationship they both sacrificed the bond they built so they could find true happiness by chasing their dreamthe movie did a lot of close ups in the film to allow us a more personal experience with the characters the film was focused on two main characters so by doing close ups it allowed us to focus on them and block out the background the videographer also used bright colors to be attractive to our eyes the film was happy and festive and the bright colors displayed that the music used was upbeat and allowed us to celebrate the great love they had for one another,happy
best film of the decade exillerating ground breaking life changing creativity excellent,happy
best film in decades not only proves its th best picture of its time but it also shows the craft of the arts and the story of what a actors go through to become actors it ties in with a fantastic romance and it won 6 oscars including best actress  best director and it holds a record of the most nominations ever with 14,happy
just an artistical masterpiece beautiful movie with an amazing score amazing storyline and characterization i made my grandpa watch it with me and he was very hesitant at first because he dislikes musicals but i got him to watch it and he was blown away this movie made my mother cry as well this isnt necessarily a full musical but truly an amazing story i recommend to everyone to watch this movie stellar performances from emma stone and ryan gosling,happy
is a special movie and damien chazelle is to be congratulated for creating it each musical number is in some way an homage to a different previous type of hollywood musical style more significant though is the way this love story captures the progression of sensations experienced when you are simultaneously concerned about ambitionachievement and about love the one criticism ive heard of the movie is that its not realistic really not realistic to have hundreds of people dancing and singing during a freeway stoppage who knew the movie isnt trying to achieve realism its artifices are transparent the point is to represent and maybe more importantly evoke in the audience the emotional moments that can occur during the trajectories of two sometimes intertwined sometimes contradictory life goals the desire for achievement and the desire for love,happy
probably one of the better movies ive seen for a hot minute acting was good original score had some catchy high pointsthe fish bowl lens was a little disorienting if i focused too hard and the ending is kinda sad in my opinion but im kind of a sucker for the feelsbut id say its close to a masterpiece,happy
i cant explain how wonderful this movie is the story is simple yet it dazzles thanks to its vivid scenery clichbreaking arcs and absolutely toptier acting talent seeing this was an experience that ill never forget,happy
only opening spoilerwhen opened with a clich of people singing on the street i couldnt help but think of bollywood and how i cant help to cringe a bitbut made me forget this very fast its very hard to describe you find yourself rooting for both main actors and their success not only because they are such likeable characters but because youre never sure you can predigt whats about to happenwhen i finished i wanted to rewatch it immidiately i think ive never had this urge to rewatch a movie that fast again many things speak for this the scenery is unique likeable characters engaging plot etc the biggest reason might be how i wished this was a videogame with different endings its funny because the movie has a message for the viewer how freedom and chasing for your dream are important it gave me this feeling of freedom that i thought i can rewatch it again and change something in the plot so i get another endingso why do i want to change the ending in terms of sending the message mentioned above the ending is perfect a very very strong and meaningful one its just that i have a soft spot for likeable characters in movies and want them to have everything in a perfect way imaginable,happy
i was not a big fan of musicalsi basically did not like to watch such a huge popular filmshowever is different from any other moviesthis shows the positive and negative sides of creators artists and performers with such a soft moody and beautiful waysit was my first time to have felt strong jealousy toward everyone who got involved with this great movie when i was watching end rollthank you for creating such an amazing feeling in my mind through this great work,happy
i dont remember feeling so happy and so devastated while watching a film in a long time gorgeous cinematography fun songs fantastic performances and a great script is just sublime,happy
is one of my favorite movies of all times there is singing out of this world romance there is loss there is sadness and then real life romance the last scene is haunting and spoiler alert the couple does not end up together which always makes for the best love stories in the last scene when ryan gosling is on the piano and emma stone is watching quietly with her husband the theater was really pin drop silence and i was screaming oscars in my head,happy
everything about this movie was astonishing the plot cinematography set design wardrobe use of colour and most importantly the casting and use of music to convey emotion a 1010 for me im not a fan of musicals at all but this isnt just a musical it also has an amazing story along with it emma and ryans connection is amazing to watch as theyve done so brilliantly before and really sells the characters,happy
i appreciate the freshness and daring of the modern day musical and thought both emma and ryan gave solid performances their singing and dancing were fine the story somewhat familiar yet still held my interest there were times that i felt like i was observing this film rather than actually being absorbed in it though nice but also not particularly memorable,happy
as much as damien chazelle has impressed everyone with his riveting and compelling direction from whiplash it shows that he delivers an authentic dazzling compelling and outstanding musical masterpiece that delivers with a heart depth and soul from a brilliant screenplay that resonates everyone with the theme of passion love dreams and inspiration that forms an intimate connection in real life the powerful acting and its performances the astonishing and sensible direction until the memorable musical score and pieces is truly the embodiment of a classic cinema that nails its perfection from start to finisheven the memorable amazing and wonderful performances of emma stone and ryan gosling as well a perfect chemistry a magnificent choreography and its gorgeous costume and production designs as well a breathtaking and sumptuous cinematography brilliant editing and a refreshing and touching musical score by justin hurwitz and its catchy musical songs perfectly composed by pasek  paul duo makes the experience of seeing a nostalgic experience a feast for the eyes and a pleasurable hearing to the ears while draws its inspiration and homages to the classic hollywood musicals of old it stands out as a unique musical while making the musical film genre revitalized as fresh and new that also helps inspire other modernday musical films for years to come and making as a modern classic for all ages,happy
mia is a barista she is also an actress with endless unsuccessful auditions as well as being a wouldbe playwright sebastian is a piano bar pianist with aspirations for owning his own jazz club they bump into each other on several occasions and a bond starts to form but in hollywood the path of love never runs smoothly does itwritten and directed by damien whiplash chazelle tells a welltravelled romantic tale of two ambitious but unsuccessful young people on the foothills of mount showbiz by the way is an excellent title being a musical reference a los angeles reference and of course also meaning living in a fantasy worldryan gosling and emma stone have already demonstrated their onscreen chemistry and this is happily maintained here they sing well if not strongly and the dance routines are attractively presented if not particularly demanding of accomplished dancers and gosling is clearly an able pianist even if his onscreen fingerwork is not always completely synchronised with what we hearthe film starts very promisingly with a musical number staged on a freeway overpass there is a strong jazzybig band feel to a song which moves from a single a capella vocal to fully orchestrated mass vocals at which point the lyrics to what was a very pleasing song get lost in the mixing there are several very effective set piece musical numbers the freeway number an evening songdance looking over la and a song during an audition were all standouts for methe musical contributions sag somewhat in the middle of the film the start promises that this will be very much a traditional hollywood musical with dramatic beats told in and punctuated by song and dance but we then tend to get musical performances rather than integrated songs and there is an overreliance on the main musical theme the one which you will know if you have seen the trailer this pops up all the way through the movie in a wide variety of different arrangements and orchestrations i would have been happier to have heard a more varied range of melodiesthis sounds very negative yet i very much enjoyed the movie if youre not a fan of musicals then its unlikely that this will convert you but i found the chemistry of the two main players delightful they both give good performances and perform well musically and terpsichoreally and chazelle directs with immense verve and imagination  just look at the camera movement and the unedited length of shots in some of the setpieces he must surely get a nomination for this years best director oscar which of course he went on to winand despite the possibility of the ending not being what you may have wanted the film remembers to be fun,happy
i was greatly looking forward to watch this movie i had read many reviews and they all seemed very positive the opening sequence took my breathe away and i never got it backthe choregraphy incredible acting emma stone and ryan gosling at their best  visuals and music blend together so wonderfullydamien chazelle successfully sent his message with the unpredictable and surprising endingspoiler alert  everything does not end perfectly and this is a reflexion of the reality these days is a film you simply never want to stop watching its a beautiful and hopeful film coming at a time when there isnt much beauty or hope in our movies destined to be a classic recommended ,happy
im not a expert on musicals  the only classic movie musical ive seen is singing in the rain  i cant say i liked it very much it all seemed too simple  too clean dare i say too romantic  it did satirize aspects of the film industry  but thats itwhere this movie wins me over is with its layer of modern storytelling its messy  its complicated but at the same time its pure filmmaking in my mind  theres no unnecessary baggage bringing the film down which is what i loved about damien chazelles other film whiplashit feels personal but not in a obsessive way its joyous  but not in a pretentious or oblivious way  im what youd call a cynic but this film brought a smile on my face but at the same time left me sad and melancholy in a good wayanother thing is i really like the music in the film the songs and the score are just awesome to listen to if youre in a good mood and go perfectly with the filmthis film is not for everybody not everyone will enjoy this film or have the same experiences with the film as i had  specially if you didnt catch it in the theater  my hope is that people just give it a shot,happy
never been a fan of the genre musical if you watched paint your wagon or cat balloo you will understand why in my view only singing in the rain was an acceptable musical now theres a second one and its not because of the great singing there isnt any of that its because of the magic rhythm and photography that i actually enjoyed the musical parts that i would normally find boring and unnecessary interfering with the plot development what a nice way of telling a tragedy,happy
damien chazelle is young talented director make a movie touch heartsemma stone make a great performance she deserved her oscarthe music and songs they was the greatest i have ever listen in movie,happy
the most beautiful movie of 2016 and one of the greatest musical movie in hollywood i have to say was brilliant on each scale whether be its songcinematography and the cast emma stone acting was wonderful every music fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificence of the movie,happy
this movie is exceptionally emotionalnot sappy just emotional i felt this movie well after the credits rolledi loved the film,happy
stands as a cinematic spectacle from the opening scene you can understand that this movie is not messing around this scene delivers amazing feelings and prepares you for an emotional rollercoaster throughout the film it is a pure hollywood love story that has been portrayed by two amazingly talented actors the movie circles around two options either choose love or choose dreams at the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it again shown in a beautiful way it takes influence from movies like singing in the rain and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one it is so perfectly crafted but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending that ending not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film also in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful for the first time in a movie i have cried so loudly when hearing a song this soundtrack gives you the feels it is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song the film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be  an unashamedly romantic musical infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from goslingstone wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from chazelle oh and its hilarious throughout too a genuine achievement  must be one of the best films ive seen in a long whilecheers to the dreamers the men and women behind the making of this musical classic masterpiece,happy
i liked a throwback to movies about people relationships and the serendipity that leads to relationships as i read the reviews of others though it seems like people either were enraptured with love or possessed of hate towards it i see this in may other reviews on the site this was not the best movie ive ever seen but i like to see a movie like this once in a while that takes us back to an earlier time sentimental yes but i like how the movie lifted the viewer into this fantasy where the shallow world of hollywood meets the simple sweetness of two people in love the music and dance added to the overall sense of fun and helped portray the ups and downs of a blossoming relationship wait for the right mood be open and ready for a sweet story and youll like,happy
i hate the ending but this movie is really great im not a musicalmovie fan but still i feel this a really great movie whoever looking for great movie should watch how great it is the ost still running in my head as well as all the scene,happy
lovely story with excellent music watched a couple times never be bored,happy
when this film first came out i mostly loved it in the last year ive watched it again and my god it has already aged poorly theres far too many unnecessary musical numbers the romance between sebastian and mia takes way too long to get off the ground the music is literally like mia says elevator music the only good song in the whole movie is audition then the last half hour of the film happens that completely invalidated the first 34 i cant even write about it without getting angry musicals are supposed to be a fun escape not make you wanna punch someone is it recommended yeah did emma stone deserve her oscar absolutely will it stand the test of time nope,happy
this is possibly one of my favorite movies it had amazing music some great chemistry and dialogue between the two leads and a bittersweet ending,happy
i am a bit skeptical with movies in this genre as what came out of hollywood in the recent years is usually mediocre to say the least that made me keep this one on a side for a while until a rainy sunday evening when all my other plans failed i regretted keeping this gem on a digital shelf for so long the movie blew me away the performance of ryan and emma is amazing you can see the chemistry between two of them that really gives life to the characters i could relate to every emotion they were going through choreographynothing bollywood flashy very story driven and romantic directing is great camera is always in the flow of the scene lights theater like which gives that vintage vibe to it story line although a cliche delivers an emotional message with not too many words to spoil the smooth dynamics of the musical i slept well that sunday evening,happy
perhaps my favorite movie to watch anytimei love this movie love the romance love the chemistry love the acting  love the direction  love the writing love the musical numbers  love the endingits so well crafted that i am in constant awe every time i watch it i still listen to the soundtrack even to this day this is my go to movie whenever i want to pass the time i just love it more every time time i watch it,happy
is a magical film with fantastic performances incredible music and perfect directing damien chazelle has already become one of my favorite directors and this is only his second picture emma stone and ryan gosling have fantastic chemistry the movie is wildly romantic and they make it so the first act is perfect but the film loses some in the second and third act i still highly recommend this movie if you are a big movie fan youll love this,happy
inhabe to say i dont normally like musicals but this one managed to move me quite a bit i appreciated it,happy
i dont often watcj musicaldance shows but this one seems attractive to me and i love the protagonist mia i admire her courage of fighting for her dream doing dear life to become a super star i understand how hard that is and i think everyone showd fight for hisher own dream i love the music very much though i dont know the name of the composer i myself love to play the piano like the male protagonist sebastian the conclusion is pretty good for the protagonists and for us the audiences typical love film with beautiful music and dances accompanyed emma quite deserves the academy award for best actress,happy
as you may be able to tell by the other reviews on this website everyone is split on whether this is a good film or a bad film think of it as this the film is described as a comedy musical and dramathis film is funny when it needs to be i wouldnt call it an out and out comedy like a kevin hart or will ferrell film nor would i compare it to a wes anderson film where its a witty black comedy its just funny when it needs to bethis film is a brilliant drama the film begins and you may think oh well this is generic but if you stay to the very end of this film you will find that damien chazelle has not only proved himself as a very good writer but is a world class director no other director can develop characters and make you care for them like damienthis film is also a musical surprise surprise i dont know what people were expecting coming into a modern musical but the director chose jazz not everyone likes jazz but personally i thoroughly enjoyed the music in this film and this comes from someone who doesnt like musicals or jazzi wont ridicule you for not liking this film but no matter what you think about musicals or dramas or the film itself you must watch your film,happy
i simply cannot understand why this film rated so highly the best part was emma stones acting but other than that there is virtually nothing worth praising if this was an attempt to revive the classic film musicals of the forties and fifties it fails utterly in my opinion the main problem is that emma stone cant sing and ryan gosling cant act another problem is that in many of the other musical numbers including the opening one in the la traffic jam you cant hear the lyrics as an actor ryan gosling reminds me of sixties actor david jansen who played richard kimble in the fugitive tv series  he has one or at the most two facial expressions overall the story is fairly boring too im writing this review about two weeks after seeing the movie and i have no desire to see it againim probably being generous in rating this 410,happy
while i like ryan gosling and emma stone in other movies i didnt think this one was all that it was hyped up to be i love musicals but this one didnt move me at all best supporting actress cmon best movie nominee dont think so even the dance sequences were cheesy not a repeater,happy
in los angeles mia emma stone is an aspiring extra that lives with three friends and works in a coffee shop sebastian seb ryan gosling is a jazz pianist that dreams on having his own club o play pure jazz when they stumble upon each other they fall in love and move in together but both are chasing their dreams and the opportunities will split them up will their love survive is a cute film with magnificent cinematography and emma stone and ryan gosling showing great chemistry and performances ryan gosling is a great actor and playing jazz is amazing however is also overrated as a film nominated to the oscar in the category best film the story is too common and simple and there are many boring music my vote is seventitle brazil cantando estaessinging seasons,happy
for starters i am not a big fan of the musical genre i see the appeal but usually when i watch a film with entire musical pieces i just see it as cringe and dumb there are some movies i really like that revolve around music that some may call a musical i liked whiplash its not like the typical of school musical but some considered still but usually i end up turning off the movie if its too old schoolthis movie though was super enjoyable the main song is still stuck in my head the dances and moments with the music didnt feel cringe or dumb at all and in fact were actually really fun they never felt out of place or random it was usually a way to show off an entire scene or tell a story in a different waythe actors ryan gosling and emma stone were amazing this is probably the best they acted in this isnt just a romantic movie this is a movie about people trying to follow their dreams even when things are rough this movie is a journey one you must sit through for the 2 hours and just have a blast throughone of my favorite movies of 2016 and definitely the best musical ever created,happy
this film was really enjoyable in many aspects and took a great opportunity to revive an older and forgotten genre but in the process of modernising completely neglected to remove any racist overtones of the past to create a film centred around a white man saving jazz a genre so deeply rooted in african american culture seems so blindly ignorant that i am shocked it was created in 2016 while the spotlight focuses in on the white leads they are surrounded by black people that are being turned into furniture in the background of their own culture while john legend performed well in a large role he was cast as the one ruining jazz by turning it into pop music while ryan gosling is the hero that must maintain the rich traditions that is not to mention the fact that emma stones talent in the film pales into insignificance a mere afterthought while the entire story line is centred around goslings own interests the film was engaging and managed to strike the difficult balance between drama and music well but it missed a wonderful opportunity to genuinely modernise a lost genre instead i was so distracted by the gross ignorance involved that i could not really enjoy it,happy
this is the film responsible for making me interested in the musical genreits an excellent portrayal of how two people bond over their dreams and their struggles this has a shot at winning best picturethe musical numbers were toetappingespecially the opening track the screenplay and direction by chazelle is fantastic they did the cinematography very well it has a cheerful toneone which will make you smile it is a very memorable experienceryan gosling is charming as ever in his role as sebastian wildera passionate jazz pianist emma stone is now a major oscars contenderher performance as mia dolan is heartbreaking throughout jk simmons was great as bill there wasntt a lot of focus on the supporting charactersbut there didnt need to be either la was a great city to set the movie ini cant really think of any other location which would be a better choice than this one there was great choreography in the dance scenes chazelle smartly evades the happilyeverafter clichgoing for a bittersweet ending instead its a truly romantic film that is very hard to forgeti salute you damien chazelle,happy
unlike bruce springsteen in 1973 and beyond just doesnt live up to the hype i love a good musical and its only fair to put this in perspective  subjectively speaking my favorite musicals include south pacific film and play singin in the rain objectively best film musical miss saigon my fair lady film little shop of horrors les miz play the film was mediocre at best and the musical scenes in gremlins 2but while was generally fun it lacked memorable tunes and outside of the two leads and jk simmons im having trouble remembering any of the other characters while the alternative universe section near the end was very moving the rest of the film just lacked souli think its so successful due in part to the hype and the mental depression more than half the voters are in following the monsters election nov 8 its escapism that is badly needed and its success also comes in part from the dumbing down of the american people which accounts in large part for the results of nov 8 most of whom wouldnt recognize a high quality musicali suspect the film will do well in the awards season but if it garners the oscar for best picture it will be another miscarriage of justice like the artist winning over hugo and gandhi and chariots of fire winning at all,happy
ever since watching the trailer i was excited to see this movie however it let me down there is no doubt that emma stone had great acting especially in the audition scenes but the story got boring at times as i was sitting there i noticed that the opening dance scene could have been much better and overall the dancing was mediocre i absolutely loved the set and costume designs personally i dont think this movie is that amazing but i have to admit the songs were emotional and catchy,happy
this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but its pretty bad boring the songs sucked i feel like they used every movie clich ever invented ryan goslings piano skills were surprising  amazing just low energy  limp otherwise this review is from someone who loves musicals and i was really looking forward to seeing this monumentally disappointed,happy
i had high hopes for this movie based on wordofmouth from other moviegoers but the only decent parts were the occasional older jazz tunes fleetingly heard throughout a dreadfully long and puffedup souffl that had no memorable music of its own to offer the listener how many times can you play the same simple semiclassical jazz tune over and over and over and still have it leave no trace of memory after the movie is finishedbeginning with the overextended opening musical sequence leading up to emma stone giving the finger to ryan gosling once a massive traffic jam on the freeway finally begins moving again all i could figuratively hear was some inept director in the background saying faster faster more energy keep smiling dammit and where casting apparently had a call where every driver stuck in traffic couldnt be over 25 preferably not over 20as the skimpy plot slowly wound its way through the seasons to give us some timeframe for reference as to the length of this tripe i kept expecting toby maguire and kirsten dunst to make a cameo appearance from their spiderman 3 jazzbar sequence to at least bring some life to the turgid pace of this dog the entire movie seemed like a two hour riff on that five minute clip and the last season actually takes place five years later like a bad coda to an awful movieryan gosling cant sing although neither could jazz artist chet baker so i didnt hold that against him but he certainly cant act either emma stones own singing paled in comparison to kirsten dunsts feeble warbling in spider man 3 and makes nicole kidmans singing in moulin rouge seem like an artistic triumph ms stone appeared to be trying her hardest to bring some much needed acting relief to the screen but often came across as chewing the scenery opposite the sheer blandness of ryan gosling walter matthau had more chemistry with barbra streisand in hello dolly and i always thought they had zero chemistry ryan gosling and emma stone have less as he seems to keep sucking it away from herthe writing directing editing special effects and even sound were awful characters just became different dancers feet were cut off in several sequences swirling the camera back and forth and back and forth took the place of cuts possible closeups were often ignored segues were choppy the dream sequences were usually laughable with the final one the most ridiculous of all and volume blared up and down throughout watching a two hour game of badminton would have been more interesting,happy
two untalented singers sing and dance poorly in humdrum fairy tale set in la opening songdance is poorly produced and choreographed nothing anywhere anytime to make audiences happy they plunked down 1015 for this shoddy film count the screenfilling closeups of their faces way too many then come back here and write a review,happy
i couldnt believe i wasted 118 minutes of my time sitting through this movie it lacks depth and the wow moment you could get in a movie what was all the hype about im sure these critics get paid behind closed doors to endorse these painfully awful movies it doesnt even deserve 1 star in my opinion,happy
is the kind of movie that you cant help but fall in love with for the sheer energy that oozes out of every frame every note and every second its on the screen it really puts you into an inexplicable kind of trance you become completely lost in its lust and aesthetic beauty director damien chazelle already the youngest winner of the best director award in the history of the golden globes may very well accomplish the same feat tomorrow at the oscars the premise of the film is simple a jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in los angeles weve heard it before but what actually creates with a rather hackneyed plot line is anything but unoriginal in fact chazelle deserves a ton of credit for creating a completely original musical one that bursts with toetappingly poetic songs and melodies that will be entrenched in peoples mind for a long time he even pays homage to the more classic films of the hollywood golden age by showing us alternate endings many films of that era were known to film two endings but how chazelle masterfuly juxtaposes the fiction to reality merits an oscar aloneaside from the incredible acting cinematography and writing one thing i must comment on about is the beautiful jazz score this soundtrack is near close to perfect especially for those that adore jazz it perfectly encapsulates all those idealist thoughts people have when daydreaming about cities like la or nyc have you ever listened to jazz music and to quote fellow imdb user elmaruecan82 just felt nostalgic over a time you werent even born in like jazz has all the elements that pulls you in as a viewer it has melody it has harmony it has rhythm but most of all it has soul and boy does this film have soul its energy is relentless and simply undeniablecoupled with the beautiful musical score and exceptionally well written songs city of stars in particular is enchanting is firstrate acting by gosling and stone gosling can really do so many roles but where i find him most effective is in his minimalism  hes really one of few actors who can show so much with so little his subtlety and nuances create such depth and mystery in a character like sebastien you could find yourself spending hours pondering over what he is merely thinking stone was great as well seemingly effortless in her ability to project a charm and likability together their chemistry was electric they really just looked like they were having a great time out there for anyone who says they couldnt dancesing wellhonestly i could go on for days about the magic of this film and this likely wont be the final copy of this review for reasons of continuing to think over and rephrase my thoughts of the film i get what people are saying about how the film finds a way to stick in your head case in point is the stuff that dreams are made of and whether youre part of the group that despises the film or not one cant deny the elegance style and melodic magic the film possesses and the ability it has to totally immerse you in all its jazzy glory and isnt that by some measure what any film really aspires to do,happy

okay big deal theyve made an original hollywood musical for the first time in decades and the music is okay and its all a big la lovefest hohumbut really is that good even if it doesnt immediately present itself as anything more than a fluffy confection this takes its place comfortably with an american in paris to which it pays considerable homageto me this is kind of a guerilla musical most of the shots seemed to source from handheld cameras its a lowbudget production that frequently uses lighting effects that would be at home in a high school musical theres little in the way of purposebuilt sets and heavy use is made of locations with showbizthemed murals and the likethe movie is set in presentday los angeles and fits the classic romantic comedy ragstoriches template neither lead is either a great dancer or a great singer but the characters are engaging and theyre having so much damn fun that its easy to get pulled inthis is a stickysweet la love story presented without a whit of irony and its sincere cheer is infectious the original music is nice and catchy and both gosling and stone present fun relatable charactersspoiler where goes from escapist confection to truly great is in the final number a bittersweet composition that reimagines the story of nia and sebastian with some crucial differences its an expression of regret and longing and somehow makes a meaningful comment about the ways we want to reshape reality the ending is noteperfectlovely movie worth the hype,happy
i guess the power of advertising remains a marvelous and powerful medium that has but one goal to make more money and in my view delivers the perfect example of this clever but unfortunate phenomenon of course everyone will go to see it even i did after all it will undoubtedly make a bundle for its producers and investors and may quite possibly even win a few awards that increasingly appear to be handed out with the sole intention of increasing a films profits even furtherhow can this possibly happen is it really all about money what did all of these people that saw the film see that i didnt admittedly not much attention should be paid to mr and mrs public who will continue to slavishly follow the opinions of others and are perfectly satisfied to have their minds dulled by average entertainment but what about the critics eg imdb and rotten tomatoes among others and especially the ones who are actually paid to deliver a service and whom one hopes and trusts to be just a little objective who can be trusted not to mislead the earnest movie lover these daysi fully appreciate that taste differs but please please tell me what exactly separates this film from mere unabashed mediocrity in considering this just for a moment one is mindful of some of the musicals of the 50s hit the deck is just one that did not possess the money machine camera work and technological advantages that are readily available today it bears pointing out that is a mere pale shadow of some of those films of so long agomore to the point in my view is a mediocre effort not worthy of the actors talents nor of that of the director who after all gave us the wonderful whiplash i do have to say that emma stone does her absolute best against almost impossible odds and gives a great performance but ryan gosling is not only miscast but displays no visible energy for his costar he appears somewhat wooden stiff and almost disinterested in the movie and this describes his dancing and singing as well the films editing furthermore leaves a lot to be desired and creates a disjointed feeling for the viewer it is almost as if some of the scenes were just thrown together haphazardly in a hurry in a boring and predictable script i really could go on and one may wonder why i have spent so much energy in criticizing this film but i simply cannot believe the accolades that it continues to receive and this upsets me greatly finally after seeing i was left feeling dissatisfied and somewhat angry at having sat through it yogesh,happy
an original hollywood musical shot in cinemascope and bright tehnicolor sebastian ryan gosling a failed jazz musician and mia emma stone s failed actress meet cute and fall in love it follows their relationship over the course of a year it all leads to a happy if bittersweet ending that literally had me sobbing in my seatthe film looks gorgeous the original score is great and the songs and dances are performed very energetically by the cast it looks just like a 1950s hollywood musical right down to the cars and clothes theres also plenty of references to the old musicals sprinkled throughout however this just misses the mark of being a great musical for one thingi didnt really like the two main characters sebastian is a bit of a jerk and very arrogant hes always talking about jazz which gets annoying mia is sweet but always seems depressed and dour all the time im not blaming the actorsi blame the script the acting is great but the characters arent i never warmed to them at all still all was forgiven during the last 10 minutes which as i said had me crying out loud also the individual music numbers throughout the picture are great so its a very good musical that i recommend just bring plenty of tissues for the end,happy
my wife and i heard good things about this film and went to see it this evening we loved it emma stone sings dances and acts her part to perfection ryan gosling is brilliant and actually plays the piano in this film damn well especially if you consider he reportedly didnt play at all and practiced 2 hours a day 6 days a week to provide such a convincing performance the wonderful music and score the extensive use of primary colours the great romantic story all of them prove that they can make them like they used to doesnt get too soppy but it does get under your skin in a nice feel good kind of way we cannot recommend it high enough and hope it cleans up at the oscars especially for the lead performances writing and best film im looking forward to adding the blu ray release to my movie collection,happy
is an amazing film the cast is excellent emma stone and ryan gosling shine in their roles theyre an absolute joy to watch the story is pretty good the whole time i watched the film i thought the story was really good but not as unique as i hoped itd be but then the end came the endi have never seen that amazing of a finale in a musical it totally made the story unique i even cried at the end i wished mia and seb had ended up together but oh well this is one of the best musicals i have ever seen its up there with singin in the rain the sound of music grease mary poppins beauty and the beast the lion king etc this is an absolutely amazing film i seriously have no flaws with the film i love how this feels like a film made in the 1950s or 1960s it is awesome the music is my favorite part of the film actually i think gosling and stone have great voices theyre no julie andrews but theyre great the audition the fools who dream song was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen in a film and definitely my favorite scene in a film this year the whole entire epilogue is also wonderful i loved how this film also had a wide range in emotion i cried laughed and smiled the movie is amazing everyone go see this film support it 1010 stars,happy
just excellent movieincredible emotionsfantastic chill music who send you in another world theirs no words how you feel after this movie wow i dont remember when i feel that after movielast scene absolutely brilliant  amazing idea  when came in this movie i didnt know that its musicale and i was thoughtoh no i hate musicale but i stay and this movie just include in another world and i was shocked  what can i tell about actors ryan gosling amazing talented actor he have something special talent to include everyone in his roleemma stone like always beautiful girl but i never thought that she can sing like that everyone who needs good emotion and life motivation i absolutely recommended watch this movie wow 1010,happy
i was completely blown away is a beautiful film an amazing experience the story the music and the performances it touched deeply in a world where geopolitics rules our lives our food our homes the journey was surreal and i was deeply moved theres nothing more to be said its about an experience gently created gently stated ten out of ten i highly rate it and recommend for all to see wishing the filmmakers the best at the oscars 2017 and again blown awayi am truly grateful for the privilege of having seen itmary wells,happy
this film tells the story of a budding actress who goes to audition after audition trying to get her break she meets a jazz musician who is also waiting for a break in his careerlooking at the ratings and the number of award nominations it has gathered i thought it would be amazing indeed the first scene of the traffic jam in the highway is great as it is a continuous shot of people singing and dancing on the highway after that such musical number if far and few in between the story is slow and drags on fortunately the subplot about how they have to follow their dreams somehow strikes a chord with the audience there is a number of songs that are good but i expected more songs and less dialogues for a musical,happy
ill keep this review straight and to the point  i liked but i didnt love it and im a little perplexed about why its a front runner for the best picture oscar i think the film looks beautiful from the camera work to the costumes and the lighting emma stone also gives a very good performance but other than that theres not much else i can really praise it kept me engaged but i wasnt riveted by it is an attempt to revive the musical genre by giving it a more modern twist its about an aspiring actress emma stone and a struggling jazz piano player ryan gosling trying to reach success in their respective industries they fall in love without much build up and they encourage each other to achieve their dreams but there are some bumps along the road i dont want to spoil it its a pretty routine bittersweet love story about the conflict between chasing your ideal career and personal happiness i think the main reason is getting so much buzz is because its nostalgic about 1940s musicals and it makes show business seem like an important industry hollywood and the critics eat up those kinds of movies i dont think the songs or the dance numbers are particularly memorable though script wise its nothing special either director damien chazelles camera work and emma stones performance are the real stars here while i dont think the actual songs are memorable they are filmed well deserves many technical awards i think most people who go into not expecting a masterpiece will be very pleased i just dont get the people calling it the best movie of the year different strokes for different folks i guess,happy
the opening shot of shows us a jammed highway of los angeles on a snowless and warm winter morning almost as if caused by the evident claustrophobia everyone exits their cars and on cue sings us their individual stories this is los angeles the land where dreams are made and destroyed people hop on cars dance in sync for miles and miles and play instruments out in the open like nobody cares magnificent this is what the rest of the movies going to feel likego back and read my first sentence again i said opening shot yes the entire opening scene is one whole goshdanged shot the entire movie is made out of long shots most of the time longshots dont work well other than to show off some technical feat they make you feel like youre holding your breath for an unnecessarily long time on the other hands opening shot is like letting out a breaththis shot sets up the chaotic atmosphere of the first meeting between mia and sebastian but its not how your typical friendship would start sebastian honks his horn at mia with the whattheheck look mia gives him the birdie and returns the whattheheck lookafter that encounter we follow mia around in her daily life shes an employee at a caf in a major studios lot trying to make her big break in acting beginning with the incident on the highway her day hasnt been going too well and after a party that frustrates her more than enlivens hera funless event that ends with her car being towedshe follows a wisp of beautiful piano music that drags her inside a bar where she encounters the pianist sebastianhere we jump back to their first encounter in the morning but this time instead of following mia this time we follow sebastian and note his daily life too hes a jazz pianist struggling to pay his bills while his one job is in a bar playing boring christmas songs that nobody wants to hear and he doesnt want to play then in a feat of both emotional bravo and idiocy he plays an unassigned piece consequently getting him fired mia approaches him but he violently brushes past her its like they were meant for each other but they dont think sothe storys simple plot twist or surprises are lacking its a path that goes up and down the bumpy road of their lives a guy and girl meet but their careers make their relationship to struggle should they follow their dreams or sacrifice their dreams to spend time with each other the story buildsor descends depends on how you look at it in small episodes that lead the tension to a depressing finale each episode is a link in a chain not a piece of a puzzle where the story calls back the earlier scenes for an important eventthe finale is surprising at first butthink about itit appears that the movie has been leading up to it the whole timewe just didnt see it coming because we hoped so much it wouldnt happendirector damien chazelle obsession with music is very evident not only in the film but also within his career his directorial debut was a musical much like he made his sophomore product about a drummer and his violently dedicated band leader he wrote a screenplay about a pianist who has to play a concert perfectly or else through his dedication that soaks through this dream project soars beautifullyjustin hurwitz chazelles college roommate composes a score so vibrantly rooted in the old musicals yet engrained with that modern 21st century intensity he had supposedly sent 1900 piano demos to chazelle before settling on six songs this is a guy to keep an eye out forthere is no film like thinking revolutionary like les miserables or bombastic like west side story or oddly magical like wizard of ozthis is the best way i can put it its all the great movie musicals and romances you have seen but at the same time its not though it borrows heavily from almost every classic it is unique in its entirety dont miss this movie some of you probably heard me quote this paragraph from the new yorkers anthony lane and i cant stress it enoughcatch the film on the largest screen you can find with a sound system to match even if that means journeying all day have a drink beforehand and whatever you do dont wait for a dvd or a download the mission of this movie will be fulfilled only if it is seen by thoseespecially kids  who may not know what busy thrills can bloom without recourse to violence from the simplest thingsyou wont have another chance to see it in theaters untilmaybeits rereleased into theaters in a couple years but by then itll be too late and regret will not be enough to compensate your missed opportunity,happy
i had a feeling having seen whiplash that damien chazelles musical would be incrediblethe film charts the careers and relationships of two characters mia emma stone a hopeful actress and sebastian ryan gosling a jazz pianist romantic in beautiful los angeles mia struggles to be noticed amidst swarms of budding youths as she faces rejection after rejection in audition after audition sebastian is tragically in love with the dying musical art of jazz and tries to reconcile his dreams of reviving the lost tradition whilst appealing to an audience they connect with each in the shared pursuit of their individual dreamsright from the opening number another day in the sun which takes place on a highway congested with the traffic of la i was grinning more than i had at any time this year the music by justin hurwitz and the choreography by mandy moore are inspired and complement each other beautifully here as in the rest of the film the style is grand large happy  to match the ambitions of the charactersthe acting is noteworthy stone is awkward disarming emotional when she needs to be and gosling is funny charming heartfelt their dancing and singing was also surprisingly good the pair create two of the most genuine performances of the yearthere are several positively magical scenes there is a wonderful playful tapdancing performance over the backdrop of the cityscape at sunset there is a romantic scene in a planetarium the epilogue sequence of what could have been was surreal with its bright pastel colours and haunting rendition of the films musical theme but a silent nod between mia and sebastian as they leave each other for potentially the last time tells me that this is not necessarily a lost opportunity life is not a surreal fairytale these characters do not receive the perfect literary happyending of walking off into the sunset life has its trials and tribulations but despite not being together neither character seems dismayed perhaps we should follow our passions reap the successes we deserve and not fret needlessly on what could have beenchazelle himself had difficulty garnering support for this movie it was quickly written off as a risky investment  a musical without well established songs by a relatively obscure director chazelle received an offer with a limited budget of 1 million to make his film but with the proviso that sebastian was a rock musician and that the bittersweet ending be dropped i am thrilled chazelle refused to compromise it was only after the success of whiplash that he received attention from studios to get his musical off the ground and create the picture i have just seeni was so entranced by chazelles movie because much like his characters who do what they love he unashamedly unabashedly has created a film of his own making with little regard for what others might want perhaps paradoxically we find we want it nonetheless because we love to see people succeed in what they love the story of mia and sebastians success was sincere emotional and inspiring this movie however is not simply the triumph of mia and sebastian but the triumph of people who follow their passions,happy
i went to see this by myself today and boy did i cry like a babybeing a massive fan of whiplash i had huge expectations for this film which were all somehow exceededs tone contrasts strongly with chazelles previous masterpiece but it still has everything from beautiful cinematography solid script and of course errorless directing the story has been told thousands of times before cant say more without spoiling it but it never once felt like a replication of anythingwhat made it special for me however was how real it felt you might disagree since characters break out singing and dancing all the time which of course does not happen in real life the long takes combined with staging and lighting makes it feel a lot more like a musical performance than a movie but as do all great films this one brings out each viewers own personal story and all of its raw emotionsthe acting is perfect this is the best i have seen from emma stone although at times i still think ryan gosling managed to outshine her a little bitlast but not least i cannot write this review without mentioning the scores from my humble experience with films from the last few years i would say no one understands music better than chazelle nothing is there without serving a purpose for the story and damn he has such good tastecant wait to see what damien chazelle does next 1010,happy
this movie needs to be seen in theaters not anywhere else the story telling cinematography lighting camera work screenplay direction and chemistry between characters are all topnotch not to mention the breathtaking music composed by justin hurwitz everything falls right into place to make this a unique cinematic experience the song in the movie the fools who dream aptly conveys the message of the movie heres to the ones who dream foolish as they may seem heres to the hearts that ache heres to the mess we make the movie is already leading golden globe award nominations and won in 8 out of 11 nominated categories in the critics choice awards i think it will also lead the oscar nominations and possibly win in most of the nominated categoriesif you have faintest of love for musicals you will end up loving this movie and even if you dont usually watch musicals may invigorate in you a love for musicals a beautiful contemporary interpretation of a timeless theme makes this movie a mustwatch,happy
whiplash was amazing anybody who saw it ranked it in the top 3 of 2014 it had a beautiful end an out of the box yet known premise all i feared with were my own expectations i was more than hyped to see it so when it released on the 9th of december i grabbed my two friends to catch it on imax and we were all simply blown away the acting was top notch the cinematography will probably win an oscar damien chazelle the director is the auteur of our times his love for jazz comes across even more beautifully this time aroundthe movie was definitely an improvement over whiplashit is realistic yet fantasy like it moves like a butterfly and stings like a bee is nothing short of a modern classic with at least 3 to 4 sequences that will go down in movie historyand no spoilers but damien did it again this time around too with the ending,happy
the struggling actress meets a determined jazz musician and they fling themselves around los angeles sights and scenes while slowly falling in love ho hum but i found a lot of ho and much to hum along to this film swept me up in a way i wasnt expecting and the effortless gliding between such a range and contrasts of styles situations and emotions worked a treat there is sentimentality quite a lot actually but also pathos doubts despair firmly grounded reality unexpected twists and over the top implausibilitylos angeles proves she has some fabulous settings and backdrops many dating back a long way which give the city more style substance and depth than the abundance of concrete freeways and glass office towers that generally appearit is a film of two leads ryan gosling as the jazz pianist sebastian and emma stone as wannabe actress mia there are no other characters of substance there is quite a lot of jazz mostly modern a little trad and some pleasant tuneful jazzpopmusical style songs if either of the leads or modern jazz is a turn off for you then it mightnt be your cup of tea because theres a lot of all three ryan gosling gets my special mention award for playing his own piano  and really well its the next level up from performers like geoffrey rush as david helfgott who can play and make a convincing show as a real pianist but ryans effort is the real dealthe film is well structured and i suspect has many references to earlier classics most of which i failed to notice but the re creation of walt disneys dancing fairy in the griffith observatory was just wonderfuli found it an effortlessly entertaining couple of hours with that feeling of how did it get to be that late when we emerged damien chazelle as writer and director in my view has scored a hat trick a home run a set to love or whatever your favourite sporting accolade is as an aussie rules follower its probably kicking the winning goal after the siren,happy
very minor spoiler alert i was lucky enough to get to see this wonderful film at an early preview screening and man i loved iti havent really personally been a big fan of musicals mainly because it seems so out of place to suddenly burst into song yet this movie managed to incorporate the singing and dancing into the story without making it seem too forced the films exploration of the idea that life doesnt always go the way we want it to is something that seems to be explored so rarely and done well in movies today chazelles exploration and execution of this idea was done so beautifully that i left the theater feeling all sorts of emotions chazelles execution of this message was really strong and impactful is a great film even from the opening scene the amazing cinematography and dance choreography made it clear that this would be a beautifully edited and directed film chazelles brilliant direction has helped produce a marvelous treat for our eyes to behold there are moments in this movie that made me laugh and some that hit me pretty badly where it hurts justin hurwitz soundtrack was also amazing throughout and i hope he wins an academy award for his talent all in all is an amazing film which pays homage to classic cinema and la if you are a fan of movies this will be a film very much worth your time,happy
has the exuberance of west side story the willpower of dreamgirls and the pizazz of greases romance writerdirector damien chazelle who rocked our world with whiplash a couple of years ago has done it again ryan gosling and emma stone are a movie match made in musical heaven i seriously cannot find a single false note withthe story is about mia emma stone who is an aspiring actress struggling from one audition to the next her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream sebastian ryan gosling is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet dreaming of someday running his own jazz club mia and sebastian meet and fall for each other but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreamsdamien chazelle has found a way to reignite our love for los angeles the way rebel without a cause did decades ago in fact much of is more or less of an homage to that james dean classic the colors the look the design the tone even though its set in present day the characters couldve easily been transported from a golden age era what an ambitious production chazelles crew even literally reserved a whole freeway just for their opening scene and trust me when i say that that scene mustve been worth the traffic because its absolutely spectacular the songs the music the choreography are flawless theyre on point theyre upbeat they take you up to cloud nine and when the rejections roll in and the characters hit rock bottom and ryan gosling melodiously sings his city of stars song its so tender it becomes your only desired remedyryan gosling and emma stone had worked together before on gangster squad so you can sense that these two actors feel very comfortable in each others company the level of trust between them is evident it must be like returning to a familiar place one sequence stands out where they dance at the griffith park and theyre so in sync you start to wonder how many takes did it take for them to get that down pat whats even more impressive is their abilities to play instruments and sing even if you dont like musical the minute you watch youll stand up and cheer because the things that gosling and stone do will blow your mind is original its remarkable its one of the best experiences ive had in theaters this year with this film chazelle has established himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time and the themes hit home pursuing your dreams does come with a cost because it all comes down to whether or not youre willing to give it all youve got its so much easier to just play it safe and do regular 9 to 5 job like everybody else pursuing your dreams is risky selfdoubt gets to haunt you every step of the way and failure lurks around the corner but whats wonderful about is that it points out the importance of having someone that believes in you just like the way mia and sebastian believe in each other the world be damned ramas screen ,happy
went to see an early screening of knowing nothing about this film its grand opening of a traffic jammed los angeles freeway on a scorching hot day weve all been there that leads to a girl singing in her car to then an amazing choreographed song and dance number with what felt like 100 singers and dancers all performing on this freeway no cgi just blew me away there were many times throughout this film where i went howd they do that and that was amazingno story spoilers but ryan goslings character of seb a musician and emma stones character of mia an actress were perfect in their roles as starving and striving artists trying to make it in their professions regardless of the fact these two soul mates are perfect for each other the real life struggles of juggling their love for one another and their career dreams hits home in a big waymajor kudos to whiplash director damien chazelle he has hit another homerun and had us singing along as we all rounded the bases,happy
la la lame  no one has liked it yetand most people have asked why it was even a movie when it could have been a 15 minute short film  pointless experienceless emotionless basically plotlessits like a lesson in how to annoy people into thinking your movie is any good at all when really its just 2 hours of noise and color that causes hollywood to reminisce and thus think youre a genus film makerwhen in reality ur not ur a mediocre movie maker 10 people i know sat through this and wondered what the hell just happened in the moviewhy did it even exist and how to get their time back literallykitchy simplified thinking the movie is a common denominator approach to all of our modern expectations a nod to the 50s  it falls way short of bringing the genuineness of 50s moviesfilms and their emotion to the screen but you may be faked into thinking otherwise since the colors and font and all of the minimum wage type of craft work is similar to 50s moviesthis is a movie that i have yet to find anyone who liked it i like musical i like films i like moviesi do not like 2 hours of nothing that acts like it is something congrats to hollywood for having their head up their ass on this one must smell nice up there smugness and all10 yawns out of 10 yawns 224 sighs out of 226 sighs 3 out of 10 stars only because emma saved it from the trash it would be without heras goslings roles can be played by an expressionless gorilla seriously la la lamemaybe if john legend played the role of the guy it would have been a better but the writing and the arbitrary color changes were stupid like a toddler made it boringlame hollywood should be ashamed of giving this awards,happy
firstly i want to clarify that isnt a bad film its fun has great production value and has some good acting along with some catchy songs the story is clear and to the point with a message youd want your kids to understand itd be great for a mindless movie night where youre too busy with the snacks and your mates to fully concentrate on artistic concepts or deep explorations of human nature but i was angry after watching it because it is not a great film or even a good one its a passable film passable films arent deserving of 6 oscars im not normally a musical person although i fully appreciate why people enjoy them but watched it due to the hype expecting some kind of revolutionary masterpiece that would become one of the few musicals i actually like but yet again i was disappointed for a start the plot was bland and uninspiring with extremely little depth i know musicals generally dont go to much depth but if youre going to be the film of the year do something original the penniless artist trope has been done many times before and even here they made the characters flat and romanticised the film seemed to jump violently between a story about real people a homage to the classics and a pantomime due to this i couldnt get immersed in the story at all nor get to know the characters by the end of it i realised i didnt care about them at all nor could i take any of it seriously a film should know what it is especially one that did so well the moulin rouge knew what it was so well that it had a giant metaphor for itself sitting in the middle of it but that comparative rant is for another daythis film did nothing new it had the same approach as musicals made 50 years ago there was no modern spin placing it in the 21st century does nothing if the bones of it are the same and that would all be fine if it wasnt hailed as a masterpiece filmmaking is an art and art needs to change and evolve praising this is stunting the growth of a genre that could potentially be so much more hollywood is spending so much time saying look how great we are and look how great we used to be that its forgetting what makes film great originality and growth hollywood needs to learn to embrace the new and daring although something tells me they never will great films are being made these days but they dont have the visibility they deserve this film wont be remembered in the history books stop acting like it will,happy
310 is all this film deserves was really looking forward to watching looking at critics viewings baftas and academy awards must have been asleep the film had a dissjointed plot which was hard to follow appeared to be based in all but none of the 20th century decades was pretentious and unwarranted of major reviews,happy
hats off to ryan gosling to learn to play the piano for this  great achievement however in the end people cannot suddenly become talented pianists singers and dancers just by practising for a film part each of these skill is extraordinarily tough and unfortunately i dont think the lead characters pulled off either the singing or dancing elements very well the result was insipid and not very memorablewithin five minutes of leaving the cinema there were no tunes or dance sequences that i could recall and the plot itself was rather depressing all in all not worth the money,happy
i can admit right off the bat that im not a fan of musicals at all the only other musicals i watched in my lifetime was little shop of horrorsbecause of the special effects and chicagobecause it also won best picture over what i think are better candidates hardly if ever watched them again so i tried to see what all the hype is about this one was it goodyes admittedly it is i like the characters the opening was one of the best tracking shots i seen in a movie comparable to the third man1958 along with some other scenes in the movie that i was impressed with the music didnt over weigh the plot and the it made sense within the storyespecially in ryan goslings casei enjoyed this film and could recommend it to anyone willing to give musicals a shot and i would of preferred if this won best picture over moonlightsorry i just think so,happy
one can easily imagine all the elements to inevitably appear in a story and theyre all here this might dissuade some to sample this movie but that would be a mistake somehow through skill and good taste the powers behind this movie and the stars themselves have wrought a miracle a true gem of a touching masterpiece there are times when the schmaltz goes on too long especially in the alternative reality towards the end but for much of the rest of the time one can be held in awe as to how good the music the dancechoreography especially for two nonvirtuoso dancers the acting and directing the writing and the actual realness of it all turns out to be of course it doesnt hurt if the touch of lunacy the dream theme and the curse of ever trying the impossible have woven themselves through the viewers life,happy
i guess i can understand why a lot of people dont like this movie but i happen to love it i took off one star because the story is very been there done that but it still kept me entertained nonetheless maybe im more easily entertained than i thought or maybe im just not uptight about movies and i know how to go in with an open mindi love the opening songscene and i dont understand how people dont see the significance to the rest of the movie if you actually pay attention to the lyrics it totally fits i also love the work of both emma stone and ryan gosling i think the fact that they are barely average singers is more realistic and relatable for this particular film there are definitely musicals out there that call for an extraordinary singing voice but this isnt one of them in my opinion same with the dancing it was all awkwardly cute to me it would have been strange if they had been singing and dancing perfectly i cant stand how people are hating on the job they did it might not be perfect but its definitely clear that a lot of work and effort went in to this movie i wouldnt have minded a few more songs though or just more variation i can understand this movie not being your cup of tea but it really bothers me when people have to hate on others just to get their point across just say the movie wasnt for you and move on ryan gosling learned to play the piano in just 3 months for this movie if its that easy why arent you the one on the big screen,happy
compare this to american in paris well is just doesnt measure upgene kelly ans leslie caron were great dancers the dancing in this is ordinary at best the music cant match gershwins and it is humorless with an ordinary script the actors do their best but it didnt keep my interest why it should get award nominations i dont know except there is little in good movies coming out of hollywoodone should care for the characters in movies and that seems lacking in modern moviesjust my opinion and im sure i will be in the minority,happy
i guess im just getting too old or dont get it theres nothing to this film that held my interest i grew up in the gene kelly cyd charisse donald oconnor fred astaire ziegfeld follies west side story all that jazz grease dirty dancing goingson im out of touch or havent what it takes to enjoy the cell phonecomputerdigital age stuff all that jazz has been the ultimate musical for me by light years and nothing has come close to that masterpiece i didnt think id like this show but i thought id like it more than i did but i dont it is worse than i expected poorly cast and a nowhere story line as trite as it can get i dont know why i give it 3 stars except i like the actors otherwise  the flick is doo doo the actors can act but they cant sing and dance,happy
im being really shallow here but i cant see past emmas huge eyes and odd teeth during the song about dreams i was mixed with wanting to feel her emotions and being fixated at how her mouth works to create sound does anybody else feel the same way i watched this movie having very high expectations due to how it has been reviewed as so so good and the number of oscars it has won i find the result a huge meh i dont think its bad its just not that good and i sure dont get why its being lauded so it is to me at best a 610even though it is a musical i came out of the show not able to remember even one number vividly the opening dance had potential but soon degraded and became bit of a bore when everyone started dancing on the cars and that scene almost didnt have any much purpose except to tell people hey im a musical watch me dance and sing in the middle of the highway its difficult not to compare this movie to disneys beauty and the beast since emmas from both shows had both offers though both emmas arent superb singers id say watson at least looks more natural singing because stones eyes and mouth are just too distracting for methere really isnt enough good singing and dancing to justify this movie to be a massive award winning one well the fact that ryan gosling plays the piano well may gain some favours ultimately a big meh,happy
this is an instant classic from the first 2 minutes it starts singing and dancing with big vistas and picturesque cinematography as someone who isnt very fond of musicals and especially new ones where the music just doesnt sound as good as the 1950s classics this has some amazing musicits also beautiful art in cinema long flowing shots with complex choreography of dancers props and the camera rig this is high craft its dreamy always lush with contrasting colors in light or wardrobe its a big satisfying visualfest that drips off the screenmost important of all its a sweet story two lovers who are perfectly matched but with timing that couldnt be more wrong im not a big fan of either actor but they pulled me in and had be interested until the endwas it perfect no is anything its about 15 minutes too fat in the running time nips and tucks wouldve helped it wouldve been a masterpiece at 145 in length and the griffith observatory dream sequence was a bit too much as my wife said it kinda jumped the shark there for a couple minutesall in all amazing unique cinema theres been nothing like this for decades my advice  sit back and let it wash over you it will make you happy and leave you with a smile when the credits roll,happy
this movie is the best film i have ever seen in my life the director is definitely not going to be a better film it must be watched with great pleasure it is an absolutely wonderful film with the audience the music the audience and the audience emma stone should definitely have an oscar this year because you watched a great movie even though you listen to your music every day again i never get bored i will never get tired of watching the movie again and again,happy
it is not the more original story ever but it gives a sense of nostalgia containing several references to classic musicals the dance scenes are frequently long takes increasing the immersion in these scenes and their spectacular natureit is a movie that brings the idea of los angeles as city of dreams and the musical as the romantic fairy tale but we know that time is not going back we cannot bring the old good musicalthe movie begins with a dance sequence that is a reference to the umbrellas of cherbourg or les parapluies de cherbourg on its original title a musical from jacques demy and it is curious that on the scene in which the casablanca windows are shot one can see parapluies above a door reinforcing that referenceanother curiosity is that one of the characteristics of the demys movies is their overlapping continuity that is characters crossing over from film to film and in what can be understood as one more reference to demy is the boss of sebastian which asks the musician not to play jazz songs but pop songs this character is played by j k simmons who also played the jazz teacher in whiplash the previous movie from damien chazelle so this character could be crossing from whiplash which would make sense as sebastian argues that jazz is becoming less popular and the character would have left his job as jazz musician and teacher becoming a bar owner who does not want jazz due to its lack of popularitythe movie has not the conventional happy ending of the musicals it seems that romance between the main characters is not the central theme of the film instead the real love was with their dreams because although the movie honours the old classics the romance story is one of the current times in which the love is no more above everything our personal dreams are many times above the people we care for but that does not mean that we will like them less,happy
i was expecting it to be overrated and it was every bit of the film was so clichd that it was very unspecial for me and seemed to drag on for a very long time i didnt like the fact that everything was too perfect because it made it hard to relate to any of the characters they were broke relatable dreamers with designer clothes expensive cars and no flaws the characters were very underdeveloped and there did not seem to be any chemistry between ryan gosling and emma stone the music was really boring and simple and every song was forgettable except for city of stars because they played it every five minutes the script felt like it was written in a week the director seemed to play it safe with every aspect and relied more on visually pleasing cinematography to tell the tale instead of gripping acting and a well written story if you want a real love story watch titanic,happy
i cant give the film higher marks as although i enjoyed it  it was great to watch as a musical it didnt have the power of say chicago the dance routines were mediocre having recently watched astaire and powell dance to begin the beguine the routine by the two actors by the lampost was just well lacking trying to be cool with hand in trouser pocket they didnt seem to me to be dancing just moving maybe its not a fair comparison but if dance routines are included theyve got to be good and memorable anyway i thoroughly enjoyed the colour the locations and the story we werent told what was going on in the story it just evolved the girl works in a cafe on a film production set we see her going to rehearsals and  despite doing well fails to get parts chance meetings with the sebastian they talk about their aspirations etc etc i saw the film with four others and they all said what did you think of that this isnt their usual response and they werent smiling i just enjoyed being entertained and watching the story unfold the singing wasnt great the songs not memorable and the dance routines okish the opening dance at the traffic jam was er different i think this scene was telling us that all of those drivers had dreams of fame  cant remember what the song was about though it was enjoyable but i didnt leave the cinema thinking id watched a great film,happy
i really liked this movie i found the tone pleasant from beginning to end i found the main characters colorful charming and very well developed for me though the most engaging parts of the movie were the musical numbers the songs in the film were very well composed and had fantastic and powerful lyrics the dancing and choreographic work were spectacular in this not to mention the camerawork which was interesting to say the least the musical numbers to me were the true highlight of this movie and i really wanted to see more of them unfortunately what drags the movie down for me is the fact that i found the story only okay while i found the musical bits amazing i thought that the story wasnt as engaging as i thought it would be there were some bits that felt too slow even though the pacing was pretty good i also found the ending of the movie to be very confusing i personally didnt find the movie amazing like many people did only good,happy
the moment i saw ratings of on internet i thought this movie doesnt have a happy ending then i went to see the movie and i was right i dont know the reason but people tend to give higher ratings for movies that have dramatic endings im not saying movie was bad it was fun to watch but just because it feels nostalgic and dramatic wont make the movie 1010 gosling couldve act way more convincing and real the time they spent together were too fast paced so i couldnt felt sad when they separatedi think movie needed 3045 minutes more songs were perfect though it was a nice movie overall but not a classic imho,happy
is one big awards contenders of 2017 sweeping the golden globes and been nominated for 11 baftas at the time of writing and received near universal acclaim but is really worthy of this praise or has it been overhyped mia emma stone and seb ryan gosling are two artistic dreamers living in the city of angels who inexplicably keeping each other in the metropolis mia is an aspiring actor and seb is a jazz pianist who wants to open his own jazz club they soon for start a relationship and encourage each other to follow their dreams but the harsh reality of real life test them regarding the personal and professional lifedamien chazelle is easily considered one of the great emerging directing having already made whiplash and now has to his credit it has been announced he would be reuniting with ryan gosling to make a biopic about neil armstrongopens with an excellent songanddance number on an la freeway and chazelle embraces the oldfashion nature of the film the film celebrates the fact it was shot in cinemascope and it uses a lot of techniques that was common in the technicolor era using long tracking shots making the dance numbers even better and the editing transitions but some of the early songs do have the same structure a soft beginning becomes a bigger numbers as the song process and then twothirds through the song one singer has a moment of introspective before a huge finish one of the best moments is a big tapdancing when mia and seb start to get to know each other wonderfully reflecting the musicals its reflectingwhen seb and mia finally get together the musical number pretty much stop and becomes more like a serious drama about a relationship whilst this part of the film of fine but it was not the pastel coloured detail that made the first act such a delight it becomes a romantic drama about the highs and lows of a relationship there is a logic in the film having less music during its middle act because of the reality of their situation but one of the big selling points of was it meant to be an allsingingalldancing aware it doesnt go back to being a musical until the third act in an extremely drawnout endingthe retro style and story about the struggles in hollywood has similarities to 2011s the artist the story of a silent movie star whose career takes a downturn whilst an actress he helped out becomes a huge star both films were celebrations of a bygone era in hollywood using the same techniques that the films that were referred used this is usually a great way for a film to gain awards attentionpersonally reminded me of john carneys begin again both similar openings including showing two characters having bad days plot points and themes about success vs artistic integrity also looks at the reality of a relationship and artistic lifestyle and it is essentially a story about the american dream  looking at the sacrifices people need to achieve their goalsoffered a lot of promise with its big opening and the film as a whole should have been a big songanddance feature throughout there is too much of a lull after its great opening act and whilst is enjoyable it is not the masterpiece some have made it out to be moana is the best musical of 2016 and chazelles previous offering whiplash was a better film,happy
the movie itself isnt bad it could be a good movie what strikes me is the antichinese sentiments that is repeatedly expressed in this movie the frenchanglo director damien chazelle is obviously racist against the chinesefirst he made ryan gosling tell the audience that nobody would ever want chinese coffee later on emma stones boyfriend whos supposed to portray a real jerk shows that he does business with chinese people he also tells that the chinese is building a bridge which is controversial as a hidden political message to the movie viewerthis frenchman obviously has a lot of hidden antichinese frustration and tries to use as racist antichinese propaganda for his own hidden political racist views against ethnic chinese peoplethe movies story itself wasnt bad and it was quite well executed but ruined by the butthurt personal political frustration of this racist frenchanglo directorwriter damien chazelle its no wonder that an asian manwhite woman couple is the only couple that has been banned from showing in this movieif the movie wasnt politically motivated i would give it a higher score,happy
without going into too much detail and spoiling the movie i believe that if a movie can make you connect to your lifes experiences andor motivate you to achieve something or help you realize that life is not that bad and such amazing story telling movies exist then that movie deserves to be called an excellent movie regardless of if you like musicals or jazz of which i happen to both love due to my background of playing music this movie will make you want to dance sing and smile and again if a movie can move you on such extremes when everythings going badly in your life then it truly deserves the ratings its getting,happy
i had high expectations for this film because it won 7 golden globes and this film topped my expectations it was entertaining and completely unexpected in most scenes entirely different to most of the typical films out there now ryan gosling was an excellent actor and a great pianist and emma stone was a great actress and a good actress in the film the film had an amazing soundtrack with songs that are still stuck in my head thanks to justin hurwitz who wrote every song on the soundtrackthis is a proper film compared to any other film in the cinemas now or made within the last decade great acting and not a bad scene that was boring everything was right,happy
all right this movie is gaining more and more echo sound as days goes by but for once all positive reviews all positive remarks all praises and compliments are more than well deservedsince second one you are drawn into the story into the characters into the music this movie is simply a piece of art something that needs to be watch and enjoyed at the same time many people are no fans of musical movies but please give it a chance take a chance on it as otherwise you will regret it deeplythe story told is nothing that we havent seen before boy and girl meet and they fall in love and make it into a musical nothing new in here but watch gets our attention is not the story itself but how it is told how we follow these characters into their lives what are they aspirations and where they come from something really reachable for us as we all can be identified with themof course the main character of the movie is the music all songs are really catchy and the dance scenes are simply brilliant full of color and rhythm as for ryan and emma i cannot think of a better duo together onscreen as they have shown in past collaborations together there is chemistry between them and that is something really important for this kind of movies both do an amazing job which is being rewarded thru the awards season that just begana movie that gives tribute to classic musical movies both made in hollywood and not so made in hollywood a move that makes you forget about what is happening around you a movie that tells a story that we all can be related to a movie that makes you feel a movie absolutely worth watching and enjoyingyou still want more watch the fantastic french film the umbrellas of cherbourg 1964 the film that inspired this fantastic piece of art that we have today and that is a piece of art itself,happy
on the surface doesnt seem too different to director damien chazelles previous film whiplash the two share a jazzandcharlieparkerobsessed male protagonist a love of music and even jk simmons however this film is wholly different and represents staggering new ground covered by chazelle and the team behind it as well as being a deliciously unique piece which seems a shoein for being the best film of 2016 in fact is not only by far the best film ive seen released in 2016 but also possibly 2015 simply put everything about it works firstly ryan gosling and emma stone are perfectly cast in their roles with effortless natural likability and chemistry that most actors can only dream of gosling provides charm a believable passion in jazz and incredible piano skills whilst stone is as genuine as ever and acts as an audience surrogate that is easy to root forthe music will not only make you tap your toes but also cause you to leave the cinema dancing with a wide grin on your face  i was a moment away from standing up and giving a round of applause when it finished the songs beside being wellsung and expertlychoreographed are easy to relisten to and are very catchyon the aesthetic side the cinematography and the colour palette are beautiful highly stylised and with an admirable range of techniques some standout sequences are the planetarium dance and heartstringpulling epilogue certainly the best thing about the entire film is its spirit and passion its so incredibly enjoyable  not a single moment is dull and though it takes place over a long period of time with a lot of events happening it is split into winter spring summer fall and winter again it is constantly fun even in the most dramatic moments it is fantastic to watch simply for the pure talent on display and the realness of the drama despite the almost fantasylike quality of the film at timesthis review cannot go into enough detail about how delightful the film is  its also worth mentioning the fresh wellwritten script also chazelles work that is often hilarious honestly i can think of no negatives right now and it will just be interesting to see how it holds up a year down the line a must watch though inevitably those who are staunchly critical of musicals may be hesitant 98100,happy
art is the shortest road between two people andr malraux i have never before revisited the cinema over and over again to watch a movie is the kind of movie that awakens the soul and leaves you feeling more thinking about your dreams your life the world around you and inside you i will not attempt to describe the films plot as it is not what matters here all you need to know about this magical film is in sebs ryan gosling eyes as he lays one last look on mia emma stone right before the end hits the screen an entire lifetime and a whole movie in one shot if casablanca had its this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship line has goslings look no words needed this movie as it promises is certainly one for the dreamers but it conceals so much beauty magic and soul in merely two hours that even the most cynical of the viewers will leave the movie theater as changed romantics only if for a nightps turns out people do love what other people are passionate about,happy
is above all an experiment in filmmaking just as the artist was to see if modern audiences can accept a bygone style of movies in todays world its exciting to see that it works based on the box office success of la la and the surge of oscars for artist there are no cheats there are no plot twists or modern devices to twist the audiences arm this is a musical that is unapologetically saccharine and delivers as a crowning achievement of the year even if it doesnt always live up to the insurmountable hype behind itthis is damien chazelles second major feature as writer director after his unbelievable debut with whiplash winner of 3 oscars and maybe the best movie ive seen since beginning reviews for this website the buzz behind this film was undeniable and i know the pressure on chazelle was great in an industry of remakes and reboots galore and despite my few issues with the film i still think he is a filmmaker above all else as oliver stone so perfectly described it i have seen the future of filmmaking and his name is damien chazelleis the romanticism of los angeles and hollywood and the story is aptly simple two people try to make a name for themselves amidst rejections galore mia emma stone likens herself as a great actress and yet cant get out of her part time job as a barista sebastian ryan gosling has a dream of opening a jazz club and reinvigorating the musical scene in the city through fate and circumstance these two run into each other more often than one might expect and as luck would have it they fall in loveas grand of a scope as the film is its essentially about these two people and the connection they share sag notably snubbed the movie of an ensemble nomination but thinking back on the story i cant even recall the side characters who occasionally dropped in both stone and gosling carry the film with humor and charm a throwback to the simple storytelling of classic mgm musicals and they sing to boot live on set tooyes this is a musical not a gritty reboot of the genre as moulin rouge was or one driven by sex and jazz like chicago or an adaptation of broadway like les mis this is a pure original story with original music in all its candycolor cinemascope shots and costumes i cant think of a movie quite like it so creative and risky to fund its like singin in the rain or american in paris and has the tone of those movies too the musical numbers themselves are each filmed in one long take a popular trend after movies like birdman and are mesmerizing to watch the opening song has a moving camera across a busy highway complete with traffic how they filmed it i will never know another song shows mia and sebastian tap dancing over a cityscape as the sun is about to set i would have to assume its computer generated but would believe otherwise im sure they had no more than 5 minutes to film the entire scene before losing lightthere are a lot of themes at work and a lot of the same ideas that whiplash previously explored jazz dreams failure the two films as different to ally as they are work to compliment each other and are the beginnings of a repertoire that only could be described as chazelleian the movie isnt all fun and games and the final 20 minutes are full of deep melancholy and regret i admired the film all the more for its conclusion but still felt the everpresent fact that in following the style of a classic mgm musical its very predictable i loved whiplash for its unique voice and style the style is still there but theres only so much a script can do that is bound by rules and guidelines the final exchange of glances between mia and sebastian and the last moments of the film are most certainly a reference to the finale of casablanca even if the ending isnt what we had hoped their look says it all well always have parisgo see this film if only because there is nothing else like it i doubt anything will ever come out again like it go for the filmmaking and admire the years best cinematography a scene in a movie theater in which emma stone is illuminated by projection light is unquestionably beautiful and the recreations of the green silhouette from vertigo is jaw dropping and unexpected if you are looking for the years best movie i dont know if this is it regardless its damn good,happy
is a fun sweet movie about two young artists their attempt to establish their careers and their love affair its enjoyable but not the masterpiece reviews insist it is mia emma stone is a barrista and an aspiring actress sebastian ryan gosling is a jazz pianist they meet during a traffic jam get together at a party and go through the ups and downs of young people who are in love and who are also chasing artistic success is a musical people sing and dance thats fun neither stone nor gosling is a professional singer or dancer so the singing and dancing are mediocre mia and sebastian go for a walk at night their walk is cinematically reminiscent of a walk that fred astaire and cyd charisse take in the 1953 movie musical band wagon  to the tune of dancing in the dark just like fred and cyd mia and seb begin their nighttime walk as bickering enemies but during the dance they warm up to each other they dance under trees and streetlights the difference is that gosling and stone cant begin to match the magic that professional dancers like astaire and charisse conjure in their dance number goslings voice is barely there in another scene stone sings what might have been a showstopping number a song about her freespirited aunt who lived in paris and went swimming in the river seine during this song stone wears a non descript baggy sweater and she barely moves stone is very compelling as an actress as a singer especially during this number she falls flat damien chazelles direction doesnt highlight the dance numbers as it might the opening scene depicts an la traffic jam passengers emerge from their cars and dance on the highway they sing a lyricdense song you cant hear them over the music in order to make out the words its frustrating their movements are not flattered by chazelles camera even so i very much enjoyed its strengths would have been evident whether anyone had been singing or not brings home how hard it is for struggling artists to nurture healthy relationships mia and sebastian live in poverty at one point he looks at a water stain on the ceiling and despairs they are crushed when their best efforts meet with failure they are tempted to sell out their careers demand that they not be present for each other for months at a time mia and sebastian let each other down drags after a bit stone and gosling are virtually the only characters in the film their key interactions are repeated redeemed itself for me in a final fantasy sequence that was incredibly poignant and true and that was unlike anything else id ever seen in any other film id recommend seeing for that sequence alone,happy
greetings again from the darkness is this a nostalgic throwback to the movie musicals of stanley donen and fred astaire or is it a contemporary film designed to revitalize the movie musical genre in an era dominated by superheroes and scifi however you might choose to label writerdirector damien chazelles followup to whiplash 2014 its clearly one of the best and most entertaining movies of the yearwhile the opening credits are still rolling presented in cinemascope being the first gag the film kicks off with its only large scale think busby berkeley on a la freeway rather than in a swimming pool musical production another day of sun its also the first of 3 lessthanwarmandfuzzy meetings between the two lead characters before they finally clickemma stone and ryan gosling light up the screen with the same incredible chemistry they displayed in crazy stupid love 2011 mia ms stone is a struggling actresswannabe working behind the counter at the warner brothers studio coffee shop sebastian mr gosling is a pianist committed to the traditions of jazz music  even as he toils in a club playing mainstream tunes for folks who arent even listeningas their relationship develops we get a tap dance number in the mulholland drive moonlight soon sebastian kind of a brooding gene kelly or a dancing james dean is forced to make a choice between finding a way to open his own jazz club or compromising his integrity by making lots of money joining a hot band led by john legend while mia is focusing on auditions and her writing which leads to a disastrous onewoman showdirector chazelle and cinematographer linus sandgren create a look in line with singin in the rain but a tone more suited to a star is born there is no shortage of romance and music but its equally balanced with melancholy foolish dreams and shattered hopes while its an homage to old hollywood los angeles and movie musicals it seems to gracefully swing between past and present  and reality and fantasymia has a bedroom wall mural of ingrid bergman while sebastian treasures his piano stool that once belonged to hoagy carmichael  two more examples of past and present intertwined ms stone and mr gosling possess solid not exceptional singing voices which aids in having the songs tell their story ms stone is quite a talent and especially stands out in her audition scenes  we feel her pouring her heart out to casting agents who may or may not even be paying attention its remarkable work from hersupporting work is provided by rosemarie dewitt as sebastians sister jk simmons as a club owner and sebastians boss finn wittrock as mias boyfriend and damon gupton also in supporting roles would be the griffith observatory after a rebel without a cause viewing the los angeles scene and the warner brothers lotthe what could have been ending sequence is top notch filmmaking in all aspects and perfectly caps a movie that drips with nostalgia  while also being touching funny and downright fun watching this film is much like going through the ups and downs of a relationship and it deserves to be seen on the big screen  enjoy the full palette of colors and the full spectrum of emotions love and heartbreak frustration anger and utter joy this is one to tell your friends about  dont wait for them to tell you,happy
is a film i feel that people are annoyed of and dont talk highly enough because of all of its popularity and glory it gets for example in sundance they got excellent reviews from critics and in the golden globes they beat a record for most globes wonwith a win of 7 globes but i think that this film deserves this amount of attention because all the big movies we get now a days are movies with a hero that is having a conflict with a villain some of those movies can be superheros from marvel and dc and some can be just plain action movies though in 2016 you wont find a better movie than this movie gave me emotions that i have never felt while watching any movie in my life i felt so much joy from the characters when they were dancing and singing it was just so beautiful i am also currently feeling sadness and anger while im writing this review towards the ending of the movie i dont really know how to respond to how the ending took place and i think it deserves to be praised for that beautiful but sad endingi knew this was going to be a good movie the moment i saw the trailer and i knew that it would be my favorite movie of the year from the opening sequence it was truthfully magnificentemma stone gave her best performances ever and she truly delivered she was so good in the film i would give her already the oscar for best female lead also ryan gosling gives a terrific performance in the film while he is playing on the piano and is tap dancing it brings a feeling of joy that its hard to get from all of the music you have now in this generation john legends acting was excellent as well his character has shown us how music has changed through out the years and thats what makes ryan goslings performance even better when he plays the piano and listens to jazz we can understand form that who sebastian really is without him talkingwhat i truly love the most out of this film is that the genre of the film is a musical this type of movie that is filmed like this and has great music is something people and i havent seen in the 21st century studios dont want to make these type of films because they wont bring as much money as captain america or the avengersso i advice for everyone that you should go out and watch this film but not to watch it because of its rating of 88 but just to go out for the fun of watching a good film its like watching a broadway show in theaters but better with amazing directory and filmographyi cant say much more but truly i think this is my personal favorite film of 2016,happy
an okay film the accolades are just too much this is boring and forgettable i cant believe this surpassed the greatest showman in awards and reviews when the story and songs in the latter are much more memorable most who have viewed tgs rewatched it more than once and i cant say the same for this movie,happy
bad music bad lyrics horrible acting poor direction dismal writing there is not one good thing i can say about this dismal disaster other than the writerdirector should be banned from ever making another film for all time not only is the acting horrendous but the singing is nonexistent and i speak as a gay man who loves a good musical and has appeared on stage professionally in quite a few it really shows the dismal state of hollyweed that this would ever even have been nominated for any awards but then that is what it has come to even the good musicals have been destroyed by making them into films iesweeney todd chicago ad nauseum the art of the musical is now officially dead and the participants here have killed it forever,happy
this is one of the best movies i have come across in a long time in fact arguably one of the best movies i have ever seen this is a beautiful film with great performances by emma stone and ryan gosling they are both extremely likable in this film and their chemistry is great the music is extraordinary and dare i say it one of the best film scores ever damien chazelle is truly a poetic genius and i believe on track to be one of the greatest film directors ever i also love his 2014 film whiplash in regards to the 14 academy award nominations i see why many think thats too many nominations but when you look into detail at what they were nominated for it does make sense because this film at least in my opinion is very well put together the sound nominations they received for example were deserved granted i never thought they would win them anyway because they do have to blend a lot of sounds together with the singing and dancing and that can actually be very tricky especially with the bigger numbers the plot is simple but the way its told is very unique and enjoyable all around an amazing film in every aspect,happy
set in a perpetually sunny and warm los angeles offers the spectacle of two wannabes longing for success and originality directorwriter damien chazelle has deliberately cast his film with stars who cant sing or dance and in goslings case cant act to explore the parallels between jazz and film stardom without gaining any particular insights along the way as far as its credentials as a musical go moulin rouge new york new york and once more with feeling from buffy the vampire slayer are all vastly superior forerunners in the categories of music and writing where this film excels and wins the race is in its soaring camera work and flawless combination of live action and cgi i really couldnt tell even on the big screen what was real and what was fake chazelle wastes absolutely no time developing characters backstory or actual relationship building as he delves into the usual dynamics of boymeetsgirl the innovation comes when he rewinds the film and shows the same story from the other perspective this is hardly new but its beautifully and excitingly done gosling may be past his prime but hes still semiattractive while emma stone is a revelation as a woman battling insecurity in a looksbased business that creates insecurity by its very nature as long as the characters are struggling for success by trying to imitate their role models they flounder its only when they strive for authenticity that their lives take off and the resolution of the film doesnt shy away from the inevitable consequences of success either go but be prepared to hate the jazz which is deliberately unappealing and ugly,happy
i was actually really looking forward to this film when it came out because damien chazelles whiplash was actually one of my most favorite movies of 2014 and naturally i was pretty excited for this and im very proud to say this instantly became my most favorite movie of all time this film is a masterpiece it contains beautiful cinematography excellent dancing choreography usually in a tv show or a movie in my opinion what truly stands out to me is that an entire sequence is done in one take or looks as if it were one take and im happy to day has many one take scene in which the cinematography is done extremely well wait did i mention the soundtrack because my god the soundtrack is perfect i seriously gotta give major props to these cinematographers that work behind the camera as well as justin hurwitz for composing such a beautiful soundtrack but what truly blew me away was the chemistry between mia and sebastian they both struggle in life in which mia constantly gets interrupted in her audition tape and struggles to find a role in a film and sebastian wants to open a jazz club in a time period where jazz is dying he then joins a band and with john legends character but their style of music is not what sebastian enjoys one of the best scenes in this film is when mia accuses sebastian of abandoning his dreams of opening a jazz club it was at this moment you finally understood the message that damien chazelle was trying to convey throughout the movie it is that you should never give up your dreams just because you fail this message is truly inspiring and is also a message to all of the young people out there that is passionate about their dreams now lets talk about the final audition for mias character this scene was handled extremely well with beautiful long take shots excellent vocals and lyrics from emma stone as well as giving a heartfelt message to the fools that dream this scene alone deserves an academy award for best actress and thankfully emma stone won best actress in the end i find this movie to be extremely satisfying and also reminded me of films of the 1980s the way this movie ended is a great throwback to the style of filmmaking back in the days,happy
city of stars are you shining just for me mia stone is an aspiring and struggling actress who spends her time in between auditions working as a barista when she walks into a restaurant and hears sebastian gosling playing piano the lives of both become entwined now both are struggling to make their dreams come true while at the same time supporting each other but somethings dont go as smooth as you hope this is a movie that had everything going against it for me i was not in the mood to watch it i usually dont like movies that have this much hype behind it and i was expecting wall to wall singing and dancing and sat down expecting to be bored and uninterested im not sure if it was those expectations or not but i ended up liking this much more than i expected to in case youre scared the movie is not wall to wall singing at all and is like chicago in the way that the musical numbers are large and full out but placed sporadically and in ways that actually make sense after the opening this is not a movie that will convert nonmusical fans into theater lovers but at the same time it wont offend those that hate them either this is a movie where i can see why it won the awards and emma stone did do a tremendous job in this very intense part overall much better than i was expecting i went in expecting to be bored and hate it and ended up actually liking and and that is a sign of how good this movie actually is i surprisingly give this a b,happy
i was real surprised with what i saw in the movie revolves around mia a coffee shop barista who aspires to be an actress and sebastian a dedicated jazz musician trying to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts with modern day la as the backdrop this musical about everyday life explores what is more important a onceinalifetime love or the spotlight everything in this movie is perfect the songs are amazing the chemistry between emma stone and ryan gosling is wonderful and the story is excellent i recommend that you check this one out definitely worth your time,happy
1 music some of them were good but the length and number of tracks were so much 2 script the ideas of script werent new neither the technique 3 acting was impressive 4 hidden layers was very good especially the contrast of modern cars and classic cars as a reflection of characters personalities 5 shooting technique was pretty impressive 6 and overall it was like i was watching a flashbacks of woody allen movies who is one my favorite directors i mean the image of la paris custom design woody allen kind of romance and everything,happy
what better way to use my first review for this wonderful movie is the new project of damien chazelle director who followed when he showed a hollywood of what was capable with his exciting whiplash and its that if we talk about chazelle we talk about passion and the love he brings loaded on video every time he plays a camera were facing one of the best cinematographic works of recent years inviting to dream love singing dancing and for this they put us in the context of the two protagonists mia dolan played by emma stone and sebastian wilder played by ryan gosling this endearing pair of artists have already worked seamlessly on previous tapes performing the roles of an aspiring actress and a jazz pianist who end up falling in love after being in various situations in the city of los angeles from the premise which we have heard of her a thousand times we can find in this story also miles of reasons to know that it is not the typical romantic comedy shops that deal with a special musical from the outset in the that each melody fulfills both the sound perfection and the development of the characters we assimilate that the soundtrack shares from the beginning a ligature with each protagonist and that isnt in a euphoric moment of the jazz pianist the music creates more euphoria still each scene is pristine bright pure and visually beautiful it has a classic tonality that honors the great tapes that made the history as casablanca michael curtiz 1942 singin in the rain gene kelly  stanley donen 1952 rebel without a cause nicholas ray 1955 or the young girls of rochefort jacques demy 1967 and many more which have a direct influence on this film for this the director proposes a photograph that also shines or degrades depending on the state of the characters with a use of bright and radiant color in much of the film in moments of happiness desire to succeed euphoria in the pursuit of dreams and some more mature dark in the conflicts between the protagonists in their cadences as artists or in a less ideal future than at the beginning around this circle of genius left the music and photography we have two great hollywood actors in the role of these artists who completely fill that gap we need we could no longer imagine another that wasnt emma stone in this role there is a great job behind all of this and yet once you dont destabilize by a good dance canteen i seem to be a positive point to the cause since you grant realism to every scene however ideal these are recurrent in the film since chazelle wants to tell us the sacrifices in this case love that have to end up making our dreams come true the memories that only the characters have in them or use the melancholy with all the aforementioned resources makes this tape the transmission of love that sits in a way not tacky with versatility gives the same musicality to the dialogues this perfect couple with a relationship from outside totally normal is also complete inside as happens in reality the question can it destroy a relationship of personal ambition could define the film life puts the obstacles that each person limits in one way or another until reaching the goal taking everything said in the conclusion he found one of the finest worked finishes of the past times which he was lucky enough to enjoy several times on the big screen its sweet and cloudy at the same time it is a smile and a tear a tribute to the cinema that only the political correctness has deprived him of the oscar to the best picture,happy
there comes to be some difficulty when creating a modern film certain expectations have been set and the job of a filmmaker is to either meet or defy them does just that and in the most brilliant of ways what emma stone and ryan gossling bring to the table is one of the things this film does right their chemistry and sense of humor play a part in why will be able to be repeatedly watched the soundtrack gets better the more times you listen to it on spotify and songs will never leave your head in the best way the thing that absolutely stands out about however is its ability to display the utter truth of lifesome dreams have to be postponed or completely dropped in order to make room for the otherswhile still delivering the message that dreaming is one of the most important aspects of life and with all that being said i wholeheartedly smile every time it is mentioned will always remain near the top of my favorite motion pictures,happy
watched this featured ryan goslingthe nice guys as sebastian wilder emma stonebirdman as mia dolan john legendsoul men as keith todd rosemarie dewittdigging for fire as laura wilder  sonya mizunoex machina as caitlin and jk simmonslabor day as bill so my overall thoughts i enjoyed the characters and as well the musical for most part once again gosling  stone put on great performances i also i enjoy its set in hollywood which is cool i also enjoyed it attempt be like singing in the rain i also how it opened in the classic cinemascope opening ok my issues are john legend not only was his character was useless also he acted so wooden also i hated the ending come on damien its a musical it shouldve ended happy amazing cinematography by linus sandgren american hustle  costume design by mary zophresinterstellar and score by justin hurwitzguy and madeline on a park bench and direction by damien chazellewhiplash a great modern musical except for the ending 810,happy
is a movie full of life love music dance cheerfulness and a lot of other twisted emotionsfirst its different it presents a simple love story a woman and a man met by chance and decided to love each other nothing complicated about it and thats what i found enjoyable about it that it just doesnt have that much of twists and troublethen theres the filming which was the thing that really hooks you up from the beginning its just the aura of these old musical films about it the music and the dances its just so colorful and cheerful and charges you with positive energy and makes you smile while watchingand theres the story some people say that the story isnt something new two young people trying to build a career in different fields search for a way to realize their dreams and have a relationship along the way but its not about the story its about how its put into the film sebastians dream of having a jazz club and mias dream of being an actress how each one supports the other into reaching and how in the end they had to choose between their dreams and their love how their choice to support each other in the first place was the reason of them breaking up how as it is shown at the end of the movie they could have made hundreds of different choices to have the life they wanted and how in the end they still loved each other but went on with their life despite it the movie is just so packed with emotions its cheerful amusing and simple and i would really recommend it for everyone who doesnt have any objections against musicals,happy
isnt just a movie its an experience to rememberdamien chazelles musical romance is a dazzling beauty that will never be forgottenthe movie is about the love affair between a jazz pianist and an actress who are struggling hard to chase their dreams through the cycle of seasons their love affair develops and their lives too keep on moving but their dreams could hardly be fulfilled in the city of starsfinally as sebastian starts to settle while mia could make even that muchthey are ripped apart each after their own dreamsthe movie has moments to remember  the first time when mia and sebastian met and through some beautiful dance moves they exchange what they feel about each other it was o so beautiful another favourite moment of mine was when mia saw sebastian five years later  both being equally successful then and sebastian played their love note over the piano and mia imagined how their life had been if they both wouldve been togetherthe cinematography and the set design here was something to remembertalking about the screenplayunlike most other romantic dramasraces away in 120 minutesthe music was excellent with meaningful lyricscity of stars being the special onefinally leaves with a message  to chase dreams  one must make a sacrificeto handle so much of things in a fashionable way damien chazelle must be applauded for a wonderful direction in two hours offers more than you would expectalmost everything you can expect from a filmthis musical masterpiece will be remembered even in years to come,happy
awesome picture its most wonderful movie in 2016 congratulations nice song city of stars great all the soundtrack of the movie very well done the plot actors stage all take it in an excellent way its one of the best movies ive seen and liked in my life congratulations,happy
sharp and shortthere is no so much more to ask from a musical beside adjectives like lovely and charming wellbalanced is the best word to describe this movie a common problem in musicales can be to much or to less music to much or to less focus on love story etc damian chazelle showed us again that he is excellent at directing this type of movies i was a little bit suspicious that he is going to achieve same success like he did with whiplash but put my doubts sidelong it brings something new something different we could call it musical of modern times is about love story between jazz pianist and young actress who is trying to find her way to fame they are ambitious he wants to bring back jazz to where it belongs showing people what are true values of music and she wants to be herself in the world of acting on their similar but different life paths there are lots of obstacles that affect their love lives and their careers we can describe it like a story about giving up from something in order to succeed in something else emma stone is perfect for this part young charming pretty and adorable emma evoked mias character exactly like it supposed to be on the other hand ryan gosling is quite good especially in that melancholic acting at the end but in some parts of the movie he has a bore glassy and blank facial expression with a lack of emotions beyond that there is no doubt that he gave his best to portray a character of a young and perspective musician best example is when he plays the piano by the position of his fingers and the way he plays the piano in the movie its obvious that he didnt know how to play it but he was very good at imitating the moves his arent my words i heard it from my friend olga who watched movie with me she took piano lessons for several years music is one of the best components of the movie simple original beautifully written and catchy despite slightly unpromising start is getting better and better as the movie goes on atmosphere in the movie is getting along with the story and that is very important the end of the movie or should i say what would happen if it happened was the best way to finish this story the way that made us and probably still make us think about similar situations in our lives excellent,happy
this movie was absolutely amazing in all aspects including cinematic story songs and visuals it connects with the viewers especially ones that have big dreams this film brought me to tears because i felt that i connected with mia emma stone on such an emotional level i have never been this moved by a film before i feel the joy in my heart just hearing the songs and watching the film i saw it three times in theaters and each experience was as great as the first gosling and stone are magic on screen and their chemistry is electric,happy
i expected more from a movie that received such high acclaim i enjoyed it but i didnt love it like i had been set up to think i would my biggest problem is that i wanted more depth from the story but i dont know what i was expecting from a movie called its as romantic and whimsical as the title suggests i suppose as someone who isnt much of a romantic i maybe wasnt the intended audience for this movie i cant truly appreciate the nostalgic feeling for old hollywood and ultimately the movie is probably amazing for a very niche group and just ok for most everyone else i wasnt wowed by the music or the production design which are the aspects i was most looking forward to i felt that it was stylistically inconsistent and i kept being pulled out of the movie to analyze the design decisions especially in terms of the set and costumes overall i do think it is a great film it just didnt quite meet my expectations,happy
could have been worse was constantly napping  glimpsing between 25 and 1 32 but generally enjoyed it especially beginning and ending it surely is an art when you are able to create from whatever material but for me there should be more much more i can never nap  glimpse when i watch certain films no matter how tired or bored i was before it is one thing to create and be prolific and another to find the target know what you are talking about be there and not a passerby,happy
10 10 landwhat is the perfect film and this cant be a 1010 were two questions running through my head at the end of the film at the edge of my seat i confidently found two answers this and yes and heres the whyis on the surface a love song to the heyday of hollywoods musicals a story of struggle to stardom of romantic and heartbreak of the juxtaposition of floaty fantasy and harsh reality the devil in disguise however lies not solely in the master level of sound design or editing but the juxtaposition between the characters and the duality and the dynamic between sound and image between whats going on in the film versus whats going in our collective mindsthe film is very aware of its own medium which in turn demonstrates the perfect balance between audio and image the movie always suggests ideas which in turn emphasizes more than telling when you must explain a joke the joke is indeed not funny if you dont get at first but never once did the editing undermine itself enough to blatantly turn to words to clarify what the story implies or aims for this is a common mistake predominantly most and every movie makes these days and they can thank mediocre writing and poor understanding of what the medium is capable of every scene every cut every line every sound cue has a rightful place in this one hundred and twentyeightminute film opus i am simply soaring in the sky after 10 years of devoted film study and more than plus 1000 films legit rated on imdb and have no proper way of concluding this review except this anecdote from my friendnow i must go home watch a crappy movie so i can get back down to earth,happy
i am a 73 year old movie goersaw this for the first time not sure what it was all aboutas of today i have been to the theater 10 times to rewatch what i now call my favorite movie of all timei admit its a little much but i cant help itit has stolen my heart and souland as if ive just fallen in lovei cant wait to go back and see it againtomorrow is academy award night and i hope it does wellthe creators of this film can rest assured it is a masterpiece of enjoyment from the great music to the great story to the film editing etcetc i saw and enjoyed so many parts i cant stop thinking about it yes ive seen other movies i really likedbut nothing ever like thiscall me crazybut i dont regret one moment of the experiencedefinitely a big screen eventonly one thing i didnt getwhen sebastian was putting on his tie in the bedroom and mia was on the phone he looked up at the ceiling and viewed a large stain is there any significance to this or was it just random filler i cant figure it outotherwise i dont know how anyone can ever top this productionbut ill see it as many times as i canthanks for reading,happy
la land in 21st century los angeles a couple mia emma stone an actress and sebastian ryan gosling a pianist the two do not do very well in their respective careersfirst lets talk about the actors ryan gosling does well on his character as does emma stone but it was ryans job for his role in case ryan gosling did not have to learn all the songs that had the piano included and emma stone  it only counts and does it very wellthe montage of the scenes are impeccable very good especially in the scene of the bridge damian chazelle deserves the oscar because he does these kinds of scenes but i do not think emma stone and ryan gosling do not think they deserve the oscar810 good,happy
the art direction is fantastic the choreography was very nice the camera direction superb the montage amazing but at the end what can i say a very poor script well told the story is so plane so basic so clich my first though was typical hollywood fast food very well dressed you know it is like a transformer movie with terrible script but with magnificent effects same here the story line is so dull but its told with an exquisite art direction to cover how shallow it really is i think is a good movie with a lot of work behind emma stone nailed it a movie with a lot of things to be admired for but it isnt the master piece everyone is talking about,happy
this is my first review for a movie i went with my wife and daughter to see this movie i enjoyed it they did not i noticed many of the reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or very negative very few in between i believe you will enjoy this movie if you like musicals but 1 you are not a huge fan of older musicals to be able to compare them since ryan and emma are not great at dancing or singing though they were very good and 2 you have not seen ryan and emma in their other movies together since you will expect their roles to be similar these are very different roles for them the producers may have done better be selecting unknown actors for these roles its like seeing pierce brosnan singing in ma ma mia after watching him as 007 its just odd my girls could not accept ryan tap dancing and singing and floating around in this movie and therefore did not enjoy it i could accept ryan and emma in these roles though not immediately and did enjoy this movie so i give it a 910,happy
i admit it i had a preconceived perception that this film is overrated and hyped up maybe i felt like this because its a musical but the truth is that we are dealing with something exceptional first of all ill divide the film into two separate parts the first is the one which could call the musical part its what you expect to watch in a classic musical but there is a big difference here the difference is called damien chazelle whiplash this extremely talented young auteur creates a directing masterpiece we should regard his work as a directing tutorial the frames the onetake moments and of course the brilliant jazz music are working on a perfect way to create a wonderful nostalgic atmosphere which looks alike a hyped 60s romance think about all these elements you adore about musicals in addition with a superb directing now the second part is what makes this movie substantial and differentiates it from other musicals i couldnt have thought even at the beginning that this story will be so powerful the script is the quintessence of motivation a hymn about dreams the leading couple sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone balance their romance on their dreams and goals they fall in love just because they inspire and motivate each other but can this love endure the reality or more essentially can these utopian dreams overpower reality each character has goals and aspirations but what does it really happen when reality strikes damien chazelle knows how to reflect the right principles about life is full of such principles and it turns into a big lifelesson where chazelle deciphers daily life and suggests that we dare to dream of course the film wont be successful without the fiery leading duo i think emma stone is a big surprise here with a performance which can be finally considered as firstclass on the other hand ryan gosling is that kind of the actor who performs brilliantly at pretty much everything their very chemistry ensures films success is probably the best film of the year it is realistic and dreamlike at the same time it is a reflection of reality dressed up in a romantic artistic musical and theatrical outfit,happy
finally a movie with a theme song like days of yore its been over 20 years since a movie has had a nice melodic theme running thru the film something you can actually hum when one leaves the theater so tired of these rap type songs with no melodies whatsoever just a bunch of noise and lyrics that cant be understood or even heardas for the movie itself excellent good story with innovative scenes and alternative story lines for non singersdancers both leads do well lets hope they start bringing back old fashioned musicals once again enough of the junk thats produced today with all special effects car crashes explosions and super type heroes not to mention recent movies that use the f word like its nothing nudity and graphic violence no im not a prude but lets leave the rough stuff at home and start producing entertainment with a capital e see,happy
is damien chazelles most recent project starring ryan gosling and emma stone these two actorsactresses have been in a few movies together already and you can clearly see that in this movie their chemistry in this movie is so good their relationship seems so real it feels like you are a fly on the wall just looking in on two real life people in a real life scenario this movie will go down as a classiclets start with the obvious the music it is so great in this film some of the greatest song in the modern film era you will find yourself singing the songs repeatedly in your head over and over again and the fact the ryan gosling learned the piano just for this movie and played it that well is absolutely astonishinganother thing i loved about this movie is the way they pay homage to older musicals this movie is shot in cinescope and it makes the movie truly beautiful i really love the way damien chazelle did the shots in the movie he was able to show the classic musical style in this movie so wellnow that brings me to my next thing i loved in this movie and that is damien chazelle he did it again after his great movie titled whiplash he comes back with yet another classic film he directed this movie so well all the shots were absolutely perfect i cant wait to see what he does next i cant say enough about this movie it is so amazing if you even slightly like movies you need to see this film the performances are so good and the movie really tugs at your heartstrings and makes you really feel for the characters and this movie drives home the theme of the dying art in the film industry and it shows that plot so well im giving damien chazelles a 910,happy
right from its stunning opening sequence is a joyous ode to the musicals of old they dont make movies like this any more except writerdirector damien chazelle just did ryan gosling and emma stone play likable starcrossed lovers artists struggling in that most la of enterprises  the elusive dream of stardom los angeles is the third central character in the film portrayed as a city of murals painted in primary colors an edward hopper print come to life not since la story has the city come to life so vividly engages in dialogue with other movies either explicitly such as rebel without a cause or implicitly such as in an american in paris this is the light side of lynchs mullholand drive which also features an aspiring actress whose excruciating auditions are shown in close up rhapsodic nostalgic giddy was a huge risk that paid off through its execution and style the camera gently lilts and tilts across the california landscape elevating story through screen language the la sun casts a golden haze over the aspirations of its protagonists in a world where pavements are lined with broken dreams and success is just a phone call away it is gosling and stone who carry the film chazelle who exalts it into the constellation of stellar cinematic turns highly recommended,happy
this film happens to be the third collaboration of emma stone and ryan gosling who plays lovers yet again after doing so twice before in crazy stupid love and gangster squad emma plays mia an up and coming actress who is hoping to catch her lucky break with acting after various auditions have gone bust ryan plays sebastian a pianist who plans to open up his own jazz club i will say while i am not a big fan of musical features since they tend to be more about singing and dancing than actual story and dialogue but it has a perfect blend of that i would say that the overall story is despite the obstacle on ones path is to always continue your dreams and to never give up,happy
to be honest i am not a musical fan but tell that to my tapping toes while watching the enchantment of one of the years best films it is a clever movie full of color brightness rhythm and emotion when it comes to talented filmmakers there is no better example of one than damien chazelle i was blown away in 2014 with whiplash and it shares so many similarities with emma stone and ryan gosling are the perfect pair to sing and play in now that your chance to see this standout film is finally here dont miss out because its simply impossible not to completely fall in love with it,happy
oh yeah the backlash is going to be huge with this one especially when its up against more important films like moonlight and manchester by the sea i definitely had problems with the film i found its main themes and conflicts to be quite unoriginal i also thought the screenplay at times didnt know where to go and was only really at its strength when it was building moments and scenarios for the songs in that respect the film isnt unlike whiplash which also had a screenplay that was its biggest weakness unlike that film though i think the screenplay is definitely more than adequate enough for building this world around the characters i can imagine many people taking heat for preferring this film over many of the other oscar contenders i can see criticisms of it being too basic and too simple on a pure filmmaking level the film is gorgeous and so brilliantlymade but i also think the two leads do a great job of building that emotional connection is the film complex not particularly and thats going to be part of the backlash does it need to be not really no only because it isnt complex doesnt mean that its not a film worthy of praise for everything it accomplishes i think its easy to look past how utterly charming and magical it honestly is i definitely had problems with it throughout but it wasnt until the last several minutes where all of my problems sort of dissipated concluding in the final minute that made me more emotional than all other films ive seen this year aside from moonlights final scenes it was at this moment where i realized how much i enjoyed it and how much of a connection i formed with the characters i feel because of this because its not about particularly thoughtprovoking or cerebral themes and because it basically succeeds or fails on ones own personal experience watching it all films do but many of them dont highlight the personal subjectivity as much as this one its going to receive a lot of backlash but what the film did make me appreciate and realize more is that we shouldnt take the little moments specific moments in our everyday lives for granted no other film this year has taught me to become more mindful of the moment and to enjoy the present in that respect its escapism at its most effective for that the film should be celebrated and for that i deeply admire what it did is it my favorite film of the year no will i be as enamored with it in the future perhaps not as much as now but what an experience it surely was but now having said all of that do i think its a particularly great film not really sureto now more specifically talk about the performances emma stone is just an incredibly charismatic and charming actress its not a very dramatic role but it doesnt need to be i definitely do have a hard time seeing her win the oscar though ryan gosling is good and also has some of the same charm but he suffers here from what i believe he has suffered in many of his films the last few years he has a certain too cool for school persona that gets infused into all of his performances it works for certain roles like drive but i honestly cant help but feel what another actor could have brought to the table i think hes at his best playing alongside stone but his individual performance not really sure it should be up for any award nominations personally,happy
to be frank you wouldnt waste your money i saw folks in michigan standing and clapping at the end its a marvel i didnt give 1010 because some of the dance and emotional scenes lacked depth from ryan gosling who somehow covered it in the end by natural pain that he carries in his presence emma stone on the contrary carried the tempo throughout the film she just proved once again that how brilliant she is in acting and surprisingly singing shes all in for an oscar this year finally i think movie tried to encompass the entire story of ones regular youthful life  which is only the life that seems to matter now a days  i however wished that it may have covered short life span with probably more intensity in that regard i revered the movie before sunrise that magnificently captured charisma and magic within a night finally in my understanding indian cinema especially bollywood has some incredible movies that captured musicals in an exceptional way somehow the showmanship in that regard fallen a bit short still its magical  much better than the artificially created poetry of birdman or superficial picturesque of revenant,happy
spoiler alert ive done it ive seen it i confess i was looking forward to it and had great hopes usual story line b trite but true narrative arch c slow in places jumbled fantasy flash of what could have been jumbles up the ending music b serviceable one terrific song actors a winning fun to watch masters of their craft welldone overall b both sentimental and realistic i liked it why because the story line is carried well by the actors who are consummate professionals great to look at move and sing serviceably in numerous closeups ryan gosling and emma stone are just mesmerizing and flawless they make it fun and easy to ignore the shortcomings,happy
every once in awhile a movie comes along that is so good that it almost feels strange to have lived in a world where the film didnt exist is exactly that type of moviefor a basic plot summary tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in los angeles sebastian ryan gosling is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club mia emma stone is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions after a couple of chance meetings however they discover that it may just take their beliefs in each other to make those dreams come trueis a kind of throwback movie to old hollywood in that it is a musical filled with many singing and dancing numbers each song is spectacular a production in and of itself and is important to the overall plot and character development within the film i can all but guarantee that you will be listening to the soundtrack for days weeks or potentially longerperhaps what makes this an alltime classic from the opening credits however is its ability to combine those musical numbers with a rocksolid plot this isnt a fluff picture by any stretch of the imagination as it contains deep themes of perseverance the power of relationships and following ones dreams the songs dances plots and characters all weave together to create a perfect tapestry of emotionit doesnt hurt obviously that the chemistry between leads gosling and stone is absolutely off thechartstruly the stuff of legends i now sort of understand why audiences some 8090 years ago cultivated from their first film together crazy stupid love the goslingstone combination was perfect for as the relationship between their characters is what makes the whole thing worki could go on and on about the ways in which i was supremely impressed by but suffice it to say here that it was one of the most entertaining emotional journeys that the cinema has taken me on in quite some time this film will likely sweep the academy awards and i wouldnt be disappointed if that indeed happens my brother recently moved out to la to pursue his own filmmaking dream so also hit me on a personal level for anyone who wants to pursue a dream though this is the movie for you,happy
year 2017 director damien chazelle a musical like ive never heard before lets talk about the plot a novice actress and a frustrated pianist fall in love in california in the city where both of them try to achieve their dreams talking about the introduction the film opens with a big piece of music and dance that doesnt do another thing than prepare the terrain for what is coming mia stone is a charismatic women with the dream of becoming an actress and sebastian gosling is a jazz pianist that dreams with opening his own club of jazz music the movie give you shots of chemical in some parts that make us arrive to the scene where they finally meet and the well created qualities of the characters make them fall in love the development of the film is technically the story of a couple fighting against their own and unique dreams but the narration through songs and dances transforms the movie into a refined and entertaining production the pursuit of their dreams border them to finish their relation but knowing that none of them would be in this part of their lives without the other the scene of the fight in the dinner is good but if there would be something that i wont forget that is the scene where they meet again at the club 5 years later they only see each other imagining a life together if only they had taken different decisions the performance of both main characters is excellent im impressed of how good humans and relatable characters chazelle had created mia is insecure and strong at the same time while seb is a man with a deep love for jazz music and always wants to feel that he has the control even if he doesnt gosling playing the piano is fantastic and the way the camera film a dance scene moving while the character does and the organization of that amount of dancers is amazing too finally is a beautiful film about love and disappointment the story tell us how hard is to achieve yours dreams and how strong the life can hit you life is simple until you find the right person everything becomes more complicated and pretty at the same time both of the characters established the foundations of what they are at the end and tell u show important is love to achieve your dreams and how important are your dreams to achieve love an inspiring movie about the sacrifices that some people do to get that sacred thing called success,happy
on a crowded los angeles highway another day of sun mia emma stone an onstudio barista and aspiring actress is distracted by her preparation for an upcoming audition she falls into a moment of road rage with sebastian ryan gosling a jazz pianist her audition goes poorly at the same time sebastian is having problems paying his bills and argues with his sister laura rosemarie dewitt before going to his next gig at a restaurant that night mias three roommates in an attempt to cheer her up invite her to a lavish party in the hollywood hills someone in the crowd finding that her car has been towed she takes a long walk back to her apartmentsebastian is directed by the restaurants owner bill j k simmons not to play any jazz while playing basic christmas songs sebastian slips into a passionate improvisation which mia overhears from outside mia  sebastians theme moved by the music she enters to find the guy from the freeway playing just at the point when sebastian is fired as he rushes out mia attempts to compliment his playing but he coldly brushes her off and passes bymonths later mia is at another party and notices sebastian is there playing as the keyboardist for a 1980s pop cover band she asks the band to play i ran so far away by a flock of seagulls after the gig the two walk together to find their cars they lament being in each others company despite the clear chemistry between them a lovely night,happy
i am not a fan of musical yet i loved this movie i am surprised to see that some people actually gave it 1 the movie is excellent stone and goslings performances are great yes it is over 2 hours long but it is well worth it and i wished it lasted longermusic wow right after i left the cinema i added the soundtrack to my apple music library it is so gooddont listen to all those complainers and see for yourself you will not be disappointedi am still talking about this movies to my friends this is how much i liked it honestly i never thought i would so impressed with a musical,happy
ladies and gentleman boys and girls i present to you what very well could and should be this years best picture winnerfrom the films incredibly choreographed opening scene becomes an eye catching toetapping and most importantly of all joyous movie going experience and the film transforms a story that at its core is rather generic into something else entirely that will very likely place into the top echelon of cinematic musicals as well as a classic of our timequite the feat then for third time feature film director damian chazelleannouncing himself to the film world with his sweatinducing drummer thriller whiplash in 2014 is chazelle stamping himself into the ranks of the great directors working in the industry todaythe jazz loving artist is a talent worth all the praise he receives as every thread of chazelles love letter to hollywood jazz romance and perhaps most importantly of all dreaming is a pure piece of cinematic ecstasyalongside dop linus sandgren whose work here may well lead to a hefty individual awards haul this season his composer justin hurwitz and genuinely the whole team behind this production chazelle has crafted up that rare movie beast a unique tapestry of brilliance that practically bounces along frame to frame and is matched majestically by its two leads who in turn give us a duo of characters we are unlikely to forget anytime soontasked with not only reigniting the chemistry they shared in the likable 2011 romantic comedy crazy stupid love and the 2013 gangster squad but pulling off the unenviable task of singing and dancing their way into the moviegoers hearts emma stone as the big dreaming wannabe actress mia and ryan gosling as jazz loving harddoneby musician sebastian make for a lovable on screen duo whose relationship together is all at once alluring believable and at times heartbreakingthe bond between these two starryeyed lovers is one you cant help but be swept up by as their individual plights and plans take shape so do our affections towards them as mia and sebastian become one of the modern eras most engaging on screen couplesthe two actors are safe to say equally deserving of awards yet as good as gosling is in a role he seemed tailor made to play this is in many ways stones true star making turn that will be nigh on impossible for any of her naysayers to deny she can no longer just be the lovable redhead from easy a or zombieland or the lucky to be there oscar nominee from birdmanin another year where natalie portman didnt too give what appears to be the performance of her career the best actess wouldve been stones for the taking stones rendition of the films key song audition is a true showstopper and proof enough of this but regardless of the results of such statue giving stones layered turn here is one for the agestheres a lot more to be said about this spellbinding romance that just so happens to express itself through its songs and music as well as its very setting but at the end of the day for anyone that calls themselves a movie lover is a brilliantly conceived big screen experience unlike anything weve seen before and a true big screen mustseein a year of largely forgettable and cookie cutter experiences chazelles love letter to film the city of lights and following your dreams should be something thats savoured and enjoyed not only in the coming months but for years yet to come5 observatory waltzes out of 5,happy
saw it again tonight wow from the very start  and i mean from the time you press the button to begin the movie until the end of the credits  it is phenomenal everything and everyone in a class by itself a keeper,happy
saw this today and i was absouletely bored to tears from watching it the songs were awful as well as the acting yeah i think the old 20th century musicals are way better then the 21st century ones hollywood has no imagination anymore,happy
when i saw the movie back in 2016 i was really looking forward to the resurgence of great hollywood musicals how disappointing can a film be one of the most forgettable movies let alone musicals 6 oscars come on if it had been lo lo london or roro rome would it have had a look in at the la la oscars  i dont think so3 years on i cant remember a single tune i admit there was a nice one but so utterly forgettable i certainly wasnt hummin it as i left the theatrethe contrived opening scene with the cars could have been so much better with some original imagination and the only other scene i vaguely remember with the dancing to the stars i think that is where that vaguely forgettable nice tune was,happy
i must confess i could not finish it and that is rare for me i hated the choices the director made the camera angles the dance moves the plot points the ryan gosling character jazz musician was pure phoniness jazz musicians are not poethermits they are in constant group interchanges and complex interrelationships it is the very essence of the authentic jazz scene what baffles me most is the energy people seem to get from this lead balloon of a movie,happy
horrible for all occasions except for one if you are looking for the perfect torture device forcing someone to watch this movie is the way to go,happy
i have no idea how this musical saw the light of day or how this movie of it has garnered an 8 stars here on imdb weak is the one word that comes to mind after watching this weak songs weak story  just weakim a big ryan gosling fan and saw this in a list of great movies of this century so far and watched it because i didnt know he could sing he does fine but there arent many demands put on his voice this is odd though since the leading man in this musical doesnt really have a signature song that showcases his voice but then the signature song from this musical the one that won the oscar is forgettable completely forgettable i mean i couldnt whistle it with a gun to my headand speaking of whistling lets just put this musical to the old grey whistle test this is an old english theatre district test where you stand outside the theatre as people leave and if the old grayhaired patrons are whistling a tune or two from the show its going to be a hit there isnt one song in this musical that could pass that test  and since im an old grayhaired guy i can tell you there isnt even a phrase i could whistle even the little phrase they repeated half a dozen times or more cant be summoned up im a musician i can hold onto a chunk of new music in my head if its memorable none of these songs wereand what happened to the fortyfive minutes or so in the middle of the movie when it stopped being a musical completely okay a musical is a show where everybody is singing their lines for the most part rather than just speaking them theres a huge chunk of this movie that has no singing at all what happenedreally 8 stars i dont see it,happy
i dont know what was all those good reviews for this garbage this is the worst musical ever that was ridiculous from the first scene to the last dont get me wrong i like gosling and stone but this was painful to watch the people who gave good reviews to thisdont know if they ever watch a musical glad it didnt win the best picture of the year,happy
from damien chazelle is a madterpiece it is the best film of all time it is perfection at its finest with the mix of great acting directing song writing good dialogue good cinematography it all sums up to a perfect film it contains a mix of emotions at certain points in the movie you will be crying and then you will be singing along and then laughing it is the first film to ever with 7 golden globe awards it is the third film of all time to earn 14 academy award nominations it won 6 including best actress  best director it highly recommend this film to anyone if your a struggling actor yourself out a dreamer watch it,happy
the best musical in years and one of the best films period a true modern masterpiece and a classic that will stand the test of time ryan gosling and emma stone were incredible together the music was just magnificent and damien chazelle is easily one of the best new directors in hollywood its the best musical ever made no other musical has ever moved me as much as this it spoke to me it inspired me this has become one of my all time favorite films heres to the fools who dream foolish as they may seem,happy
two annoying clueless white people drone in monotones and shuffle around emma stone cannot sing ryan gosling cannot sing neither can dance neither of their characters is likeable the acting is nonexistent the storyline is bilge i am at a complete loss when it comes to the oscars and the hype because this film is just plain terrible in every way,happy
honestly i tried and tried but try as i might i couldnt get in the least bit involved or interested in this movie  i couldnt care less about the bland story line or plot  was there a plot   as for the monotonous music and the lack of any feeling for the leading characters well im sorry but i was pretty much amazed at the hype over this movie  i managed three quarters of this movie and then decided id be happier loading the dish washer  according to some reviews the beauty and emotion in the movie comes at the end  im sure it does  thank goodness it came to an end ,happy
this is the fact of life not everything we love we gets and the most lovely scene when they told each other that we will remain love each other forever and when wasnt not selfish at the last scene when he told her by his head go i will always love u and u can go to ur family,happy
worst film ive seen in a long time hopeless pap,happy
i love musicals it would be trite to list all the great ones and would only cause grief to list the ones i think are bad but if the music man is the greatest musical ever put to film  and i submit that it is  is the worst cast as badly as west side story sung as badly as paint your wagon or goodbye mr chips danced as badly as elaine at the staff christmas party in seinfeld choreographed as badly as flashdance and acted as badly as dirty dancing this is as close to a zerostar movie as youll ever get the opening number is total cheese but i hung in there the girls get hyped for a night out and i think ok this is a throwback to the technicolor marvels of the 50s ill run with it but then its just obnoxious people meeting other obnoxious people for 2 hours emma stones face looks like a fish ryan gosling looks like hes been sniffing glue the former can act the latter cannot neither can sing or dance a lick first i started muting it during the musical numbers not kidding to avoid bleeding to death out my ears then i started skipping it to avoid throwing a heavy object and ruining my big tv at the 75minute mark give or take i bailed if this is a 10star 14 oscarnom movie im richard branson,happy
writerdirector damien chazelles offers a delightful exuberant indulgence in song and dance in the fred astaireginger rogers tradition with romance on their minds mia and sebastian find themselves adrift in hollywood crisscrossing each other in their aspirational endeavors hes a jazz pianist who cant conform to playing bland music and she cant quite secure a desirable role,happy
pretty bad movie a couple of good songs but mostly artistic pretense insipid tedious etc i play jazz there was little jazz in the soundtrack an arpeggio does not jazz make perhaps one of the most disappointing movies everhere is the deal about jazz it is spontaneous composition against a standard it is like mapping constellations against an infinite night of stars this movie failsto express that it is a trifling joke nothing more,happy
had this musical won the oscar for best picture of the year there would have been an outcry far greater than when an american in paris won in 1951 both these musicals suffered from a complete lack of plotthe first 90 minutes of this film is a complete waste gosling and stone even killed the oscar winning song when they sang it their dancing was no fred and ginger eitherthe story might have taken off once they attained success but their careers would separate themthe film by itself could put you in lala land this was a real sleeper of major proportions the academy must have been in lala land when they were voting stone as best actress and other awards warren beatty youre certainly vindicated for naming the wrong film this one as the best picture film needs to be put asleep,happy
apart from the obviousness of the drama and typical clichs that romantic movies tend to have has almost none movie does amazing job by capturing true emotions known to us even when its slightly exaggerated and sometimes goes into absurd feelings gained from it are on point and whats most important its true and im sure those who had experienced close relationships with a literal meaning of close and not well we sometimes understand each other will feel every second of it and also might have hard time stopping the tears,happy
this is one of the remarkable romance movies ive ever watched its a love story of a desperate couple who try to sustain their love while at the same time trying to pursue their career dreams of course there will be a tradeoff their love becomes a dream while their dreams become truethe film has effective metaphors also the state of their relationship is perfectly illustrated as the four seasons of a year in an enjoyable and musical way storytelling is perfect and events are crystal clear for the acting both ryan and emma are very good fits for their roles the ending might make the viewer a little bit sad but it is a delightful experience its probably going to worth your time,happy
this is a musical and love movie the main character is sebastian and mia sebastian likes jazz music and plays piano but his talent is unacceptable mia also wants to be actresses but always fails an audition one day they meet each other and fall in love however when sebastian joins in a jazz group their relationship gradually get worse when i watch their dance i think that their performance is very amazing also i am very impressed with the beginning scene,happy
reignites a fire that has been lost from a hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots its refreshing to see a totally unique film especially one that grasps the nature of hollywood and los angeles in such an unconventional way the singing the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life the long musical sequences often border on the surreal taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring this is quickly remedied but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing watching is like being awake during a wondrous dream there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between mia and sebastian as well as the visuals of los angeles that surround them as he sits at his piano sebastian sweetly and softly sings mia a love song a powerful couple of lines that represent love art and life city of stars are you shining just for me city of stars there so much that i can see who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new or one more dream that i cannot make true with a dream has come true and made its way onto the big screen,happy
at the very beginning of every year i write a list of all of the movies that ive been anticipating for a long time mostly based on comicbooks and those that either have a good premise a good director andor a good cast didnt have a release date in january i think but even if they had id have probably left it out maybe i did i dont have a least favorite genre i enjoy watching every type of movie but musicals are by far the ones that i find to be less interesting or even wellmade so even with a great director and cast i only got the urge to watch this film because of all of the oscar talk and the beautiful soundtrack that ive been listening to in the last couple of days perfect magic absolutely stunning i dont have words to describe how amazing chazelles direction is i mean anyone can enjoy this film because it is great entertainment but the amount of work that they had with this masterpiece is unbelievable extremely looooong takes over and over again with excellent synchronized choreography and an original score to remember forever and ever every single shot drops such marvelous quality that i kept being surprised every single scene this is the best directing skills that ive seen from a director since god knows when congratulations damien chazelle you won yourself an oscar a golden globe and every other award that honors the man behind everythingryan gosling and emma stone are incredible and i cant imagine any other actors portraying their roles gosling is the usual funny charming and loving guy while emma stone definitely has her career best performance even better than on birdman worthy of many awards the way they interpret the songs is so captivating and emotional that they just make the music even greater watching besides listening gives it such a more compelling meaning the score is so beautiful and heartfelt that its impossible to explain through words the feelings one has as listening to them  just fantasticmy only concern with the movie was the romance and the overall story i thought it would be super clich and follow the usual paths that this type of films have  nop even the story is great i mean i dont want to spoil anything but let me just say that clich is not a word that ill use to describe this movie it doesnt follow anything it has its own original story and the romance is super smooth as the actors terrific performances it feels reali never thought id say this ever but  is probably the best film of 2016 and my favorite for sure one of the best direction ive ever seen from anyone please damien chazelle keep going an absolutely pitchperfect duo ryan gosling and emma stone have a perfect chemistry a fantastic nonclich original story about pursuing dreams and the most beautiful and heartfelt soundtrack that ill listen over and over again for god knows how long  magical rememberable i cant wait to watch it againmsb reviews  if you like my reviews please follow my blog ,happy
really knocks it out of the park as a modern musical that incorporates elements of the classics while its initial reception was overwhelmingly positive unfortunately it led to backlash from others many of whom cited reasons that suggest they are not fans of the genre in the first placeeven the most cynical hater of and other movies with joy inspiring visuals and music think disney films would agree thats cinematography is incredible its not just the colors and artistic value of each shot but the long takes far exceeded my expectations so we all realized the movie had two sixminute takes which were impressive in their own right there were actually many long takes that lasted several minutes in scenes with just conversationsplot advancement completely unnecessary but an example of the kind of work and attention to detail that went into this passion projectthe soundtrack has been a hit with millions of viewers around the world not much else to say here as the music clearly was successful at evoking strong emotions within viewers many of whom bought the soundtrack and relived the movie over and over after leaving the theater emma stone is a brilliant actor and really showcases her talents in while theres nothing wrong with goslings performance his character isnt exactly written to be as emotional and expressive  hes simply sebastian the jazzobsessed musician who cares about little else for a good portion of the movieive seen this movie several times with people who otherwise wouldnt have watched it but did hear about its critical success most teared up or cried  after all the themes of love and pursuing your dreams are universal overall is a wonderful work of art and succeeds when it comes to evoking strong emotions,happy
simple as that utter garbage pirate this no point in ever buying this no storyline no real commitment to any character i was already asleep by about the 15minute mark not worth anyones time and definitely not worth an 810 this is one of the most boosted movies ever in imdb,happy
mia dolan is an aspiring actress working at a coffee shop at warner studios and sebastian wilder is a jazz pianist reduced to playing familiar christmas tunes in a restaurant inevitably they are going to meet actually they meet three times before they finally get together it first it appears that they wont get along their earlier meetings were fairly confrontational and then she tells him that she hates his beloved jazz not surprisingly though they form a relationship but things arent perfect they each encourage the other but when one of them compromises on their dream and finds success that takes them away while the other struggles with their own dreamid heard great things about this film and while it wasnt quite as amazing as some reviews suggested it was still a delight to watch emma stone and ryan gosling are impressive as our two protagonists the rest of the cast are solid enough but it is the two leads who dominate the songs are decent enough but didnt feel too memorable of course this may be because ive only watched the film once the story does occasionally go in directions i didnt expect overall id certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a feelgood musical that harks back to the classic era for the genre rather than relying on familiar songs,happy
the production is slick supporting roles are strong  casting john legend as a musician takes money i guess but its an easy win but making a musical requires leads who can sing and dance gosling cant sing at all well and emma stone simply cant produce pleasant sounds neither can dance at all well and in at least one scene stone not only danced badly but repeated her moves a failed trick in flashdance and no better here the movie lasts too long given its weak themes and then when it could be stopped and the audience blessedly released it generates an alternate ending no visible reason for this dodge that makes it another 20 minutes or so long if i were at home i would have turned it off but my significant other had a very large bucket of popcorn to finish so i had to sit through it,happy
from beginning to end ive never seen a film so modern so unique and so right for the era in which the movie was made i read critics write that is a film like they used to make them  and to me that feels a lazy and obvious description of a picture of song dance and romancewas entertaining throughout it lacked a dull moment with each second compelling as the last,happy
my 22 year old son told me to watch this movie because he loved it so much i didnt this would be my cup of tea but the music helped me get immersed in the story and the theme following your dreams if you have ever really been in love you will believe in this movie give it a try and dont read all the bad reviews,happy
has obviously resonated with filmgoers with a 30 million budget the film has taken in over 440 million in international box office receipts but the question that must be asked how does compare with other film musicals arguably the answer is not very wellone of the joys of the older musicals is the ability to enjoy watching judy garlands films over and over it would be difficult to avoid using the fast forward clicker in a reviewing of in the tradition of the multiple film versions of a star is born the musicals would also offer a social commentary on the insider world of hollywood indeed that is the goal of which seems to suggest that one can live out ones dreams in hollywood but it might take a toll on ones personal life what a difference this is from the serious and indeed tragic tone in a star is born especially in the judy garlandjames mason versionanother major shortcoming of was in the music while there were several nice songs it was painfully apparent that ryan gosling and emma stone did not have much range in their voices much of the pacing of the film was labored and the narrative never made clear why sebastian and mia drifted apart at the precise moment when they were on the threshold of success in their careersthe heart and soul of was in the romance yet the chemistry between gosling and stone was not terrific and it was never made clear precisely when the characters fell in love sebastian was extremely callous to mia when she was about to give him a compliment after a song he played in the restaurant the filmmakers had the obligation to make the relationship believable and organic one of the taglines of the characters came in describing the mess we make but parts of this film were also a bit messywas clearly intended as a romantic fable one underrated musical fantasy that might be just as good is francis ford coppolas one from the heart 1981 that had more depth and imagination than,happy
a lot of reviews on imdb thought that this movie deserved a 110 and more considered it a great one and while it seems that this movie is having an undeserved rating i wouldnt consider it really a bad one in fact i had fun watching it and though it is a bit long for its content it is nevertheless amusingyes movies are subjective but still one can judge a movie for what it has got to offer especially for movie lovers a set of artistic principles can be laidill be quick on its positive aspects the music not the dancing and singing is good the plot is entertaining some of the scenes especially between stones and gosling are innovative and others attempted to revive the classics chazelle also put a great deal of effort with the cameraworkwell for the negative side the singing and dancing were not so good and for a musical this is really important some said that it was better that the singing was modest for it appeals more to the characters but really a musical should introduce something beautiful for the viewer to get emotionally attached and it wont seem abnormal it is a musical after all look at west side story 1961 or singin in the rain 1952 every song is memorable well and that is another issue with i forgot the songs the minute the movie endedthe characters also seemed a bit shallow goslings character was a bit deeper than stones but his acting was bad emma made a good effort in acting to enhance her characterthe script also seemed of little depth so it is about following your dreams an idea now overused and the conflicts one may encounter with the person heshe loves and while there is nothing indeed special about this i have to say that the execution makes it somehow dull the dialogue is bluntly thrown at us with nothing to take hold of at some point in the movie i remembered in the mood for love 2000 a dramaromance movie that i found much deeper and better executedi wont say anything about the movies last 15 or 20 minutes that would spoil the movie for you but id like to point out that it is really inconsistent with the rest of the movie i think many had the same feeling and the way the movie neglected some of the details was not helpful at allall in all is a descent movie and a fun to watch,happy
its been decades since a studio produced the kind of colorful musical fantasy that so affectionately salutes but writerdirector damien chazelle is the guy who done the job perfectly it is highconcept pastiche filled with beautiful people beautiful movement and beautiful colors at its best probes the irony of its existence celebrating the greatness of a bygone era in the context of changing times as a drama this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to but for chazelle the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody so in spite of its flaws has moments of pleasure and satisfaction that are worth the price of admission its not that its a bad movie its just not an outstanding entertainment the way great movies especially musicals should be i go with 355 for the musical drama by damien chazelle and i do think that it is the frontrunner for the oscars,happy
captivating show from the very starttremendous performance by ryan and emmainspiring message on love and dreamsplus a very clean moviethank youdefinitely adding this one to my collection,happy
world is going nuts a few people out there still really know how to recognize a nice film this is a hugely overrated one,happy
is a cinematic masterpiece director damien chazelle proves that he is the best director in the business right now following up whiplash with something like this is astonishing the visual effects and camera work are the best weve seen in the past years emma stones oscar winning performance is her best work as an actress with ryan gosling as the love interest in his oscar nominating performance the original soundtrack ignites the film with powerful pieces especially the piano this has to be considered one of the best movies of the twenty first century,happy
i know that these type of movies are not for everyone i realize that it can be boring and that is what happened with me but it doesnt have to be for everyone if you re not a demanding guy if you re a patient viewer with a cigar relaxing at his sofa yes you might be thrilled despite that i think that ryans and emmas good performance was wasted because it had such a good dramatic romantic story that led to motivation and a pure inspiring movie relation to music i agree it had to be with music and acting but without so many musical songs every couple of minutes i think the direction was quite poor and the lighting wasnt that great its one of those movies i guess that half of the crowd wont ever see again and the other half will rewatch,happy
what is soo special about this movie  well its entertaining and kind of enjoyable but its not a masterpiece as everyones saying ,happy
emma stone has that lindsey lohan look cute nice figure nothing but a bunch of pathetic hollywood  in this film,happy
was nothing more than just wonderful for musical lovers who tend to dream and love all the classy small things from pretty dresses to desperate people trying to find their happiness and succes in life is this a movie thats worth to watch i find it brilliant as all of the elements in this movie had a huge interest in my life  loved all the songs especially mias song when shes attending for an audition emma stone is incredibly talented and so is ryan gosling perfect for the rolesthe ending touched me as i and many other people expected a different ending i love and hate that they did it as they did  yes it would have been a clich so its good to sometimes show reality life isnt all pink skies and dances on roses but on the other hand i really hated the fact that they were made for each other and destiny didnt put them together those two had a place in my heart but good very goood,happy
a fullstar hollywood musical emma stone and ryan gosling are just brilliant on their roles direction photograpghy choreography are all up for oscar nomination and on top of all these the soundtrack will haunt your day and nights for a long long time finally a perfectly made romantic full of los angeles and bright colours musical,happy
you know when you are reflecting on a moment memory and think of i took the chance it would have turn out better and u make up that story line of hope in ur mind thats exactly what this movie is the musical bits really go hard on the dreamy romantic vibe and i love ittake a chance on this film its worth your time,happy
lala land was a great movie and i loved the songs but the ending wasnt my favourite i get that it wasnt a classic romance where they live happily ever after and i respect that but it was a little upsetting that they didnt end up together they seemed perfect together and had a great story but the fact they moved on was sad dont get me wrong i loved the movie but it was quite sad and confusing at the end,happy

is a callback to old timey muscial movies infused with fun and technicolor from the opening scene where we find a group of people stuck on the freeway who suddenly break into song and dance to the closing notes it never forgets why it was made and thats to entertain and remind us of the golden age of cinema when big bombastic musicals were the ragewhat really sets this one apart other than the time it was made is that the main actors namely emma stone and ryan gosling arent necessarily trained singers and dancers theyre capable and theyre able to pull it off but theres this note of amateurishness about them not a bad thing in fact it makes this feel a lot more real weve all had those moments that for whatever reason we do a little jig or maybe we sing a bit along to the radio and honestly most people dont have any training in these things so its refreshing when somebody who isnt a pro does socolor also plays a big part in this you can see it from the opening scene where everybody is dressed in bright solid colors as they sing and dance along the freeway to when the girls go out to a party each in their own brightly colored dress it evokes the old films that were filmed in technicolor where everything was bright and colorful simply because they could show such a thingthe story follows two individuals one is a musician who is in love with jazz and dreams of opening his own jazz club the other is a struggling actress who loves old cinema again these are call backs to older movies and musicals it follows them through their life as they chase their dreams and fall in love its all rather charming and it leads to a conclusion that a lot of people found offputting but i felt suited the tone rather wellits a shame this didnt win the oscar but it did win multiple awards so thats something,happy
it was so interesting and musical with a mentionable storyline,happy

this movie is something extraordinary i enjoyed every scene in this movie ryan gosling and emma stone make the perfect duo and seeing them together on screen is very heart touching it is like the two stars were made for each other the movie is ideal because of their acting singing dancing and just them being in love with each other i think that this movie is one of the 21st centurys hits the movie is appropriate for everyone and you can enjoy it watching and alone and with friends if you ever want to watch a romantic and musical masterpiece then this movie is for you,happy

i think the story of this movie is realistic it is not only the cinderella story but also it expresses a bittersweet life the heroine of this movie mia is worried about her dream which is hard to fulfill mia tries to do her best dozens of times but she always fails she is a good character so i can identify with her and also i want to cheer for her in fact i dont like the ending of it is a probably happy ending because their each dreams come true however the scene of the separation makes me very sad it leaves a bad aftertaste i think,happy
there are various kinds of reality about los angeles and its surrounding environs one is the decadeslong reputation it has of making dreams come true another on the opposite end of the spectrum is the equally long reputation it has of destroying those dreams and still another is one where every wacky thing that can happen to any part of the human race good or bad does indeed happen televised highspeed car chases firestorms fueled by santa ana winds incredible urban flooding earthquakes ethnic gang murders riots entertainment scandals especially the latter becausewell theres hollywood but in 2016 a totally unusual film came out that tried and in many ways succeeded in restoring a fair amount if not all of the reputation that la has of being a proud metropolis that film was a film that became one of the highest grossing musicals in hollywood history and won a staggering six oscarsbeginning with one of the most elaborate opening musical numbers ever staged for any film done on location at the interchange of i105 and i110 the film charts an aspiring jazz pianist ryan gosling who finds his career going nowhere forced as he is to find gigs in dingy bars and clubs in and around la and being prodded by a friend john legend to adjust to the changing times of the jazz genre and then there is an aspiring actress emma stone who inbetween casting auditions that also go nowhere is serving her time out as a barrista to the stars no one would think that these two disparate souls with dreams that are either being stalled or going in reverse could possibly meet let alone fall in love but this being los angeles in general and hollywood specifically it does indeed happenof course nothing ever happens without some kinks even as gosling and stone find themselves falling in love they also see their careers finally starting to rise which in turn leads to their budding romance undergoing as much strain as one of the regions many earthquake faults stone is initially not even remotely fond of the jazz music that gosling parlays his trade in and gosling is himself cynical of the acting business and even the approach of angelinos to life in general they worship everything and they value nothing still in between these foibles and acts of dissolution and disillusionment both gosling and stone engage in wily banter and some of the most incredible musical numbers seen in any hollywood film outside of animated movies for decades including the wishfulfilling city of starsdamien chazelle who wrote and directed the 2014 oscarwinning drama whiplash was taking a sizeable risk in making he clearly wanted to bring about in the late part of the second decade of the 21st century the same kinds of emotions that one felt in past musicals like singin in the rain west side story and cabaret but with something wholly original but even with more recent box office hits like chicago and dreamgirls musicals are as expensive to pull off as almost any other kind of film except for comicbook cgi extravaganzas and some of the biggest ones even if in the distant past have been tremendous box office disasters what chazelle had going for him here fortunately were two extremely appealing leads in gosling and stone as well as supporting turns from legend a devotee of oldschool rb and jazz music and jk simmons who plays goslings boss and who won a best supporting actor oscar for his role in whiplash and even more to the point los angeles and its satellite cities and landmarks serve as supporting characters themselves the hermosa beach pier the griffith observatory the rialto theater in south pasadena the chateau marmont in west hollywood the colorado street bridge in pasadena and the aforementioned i105i110 interchange in south los angelesalthough it is at times a bit emotionally distant is still an entirely original musical in which the world or at least la itself is the stage and the characters and the region itself all play their parts this is never the easiest thing to pull off but chazelle and company managed to do it and do it like gangbusters,happy
such an old theme but still touching i have imaged the whole life with you but we will never achieve,happy
i love everything about this film the aesthetic the music the story and the acting  it has it all and is definitely worth the hype visiting la recently made it all the more of a special viewing rewatchable and touching this movie captures the spirit of hollywood like few have,happy
while this movie is sometimes depicted simply as oscarbait and hollywood filmmakers celebrating themselves i beg to differ in my opinion this movie is one of the best standalone romantic movies musicals even of all timethe soundtrack and score throughout this movie is phenomenal the music is extremely catchy and does exceedingly well in captivating the feelings of our protagonists and their state of mind to prove my point my top artist of 2016 on spotify was ryan gosling thats how good the soundtrack isthe acting also has to be commended especially from emma stone which gives the performance of a lifetime she does steal the show quite a bit in my opinion but the whole cast deserves a pat on the back and i find ryan gosling surprisingly hilarious in his role with his temper and funny quirksthe story itself is naturally engaging in the musical way of things and our protagonists have a wonderful sense of chemistry that is hard not to fall forthe overall themes however are what really keeps me thinking about this movie how the struggles of a tough careerpath and your personal lovelife constantly brings you ups and downs do they change along the way would you trade a part of yourself to achieve your goals how we deal with these situations and the sacrifices that has to be made along the way are challenges that most people can relate toi would definitely recommend this movie to anyone especially if you like the grandeur hollywoodtheme in and of itself or is a fan of musicals,happy

la la landchazelle is on a strike with successive jaw dropping projects coming out his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals the director damien chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious working over a year on editing along with tom cross chazelle wishes you to understand the ifs and buts of this show business in one note and boy what a note it is i am sorry but that hooked theme of justin hurwitz whispered in every line of the film always sobers me upall hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces the view gets better and better and so does the performance and daunting as this task may sound but emma stone and ryan gosling might be the new woody allen and diane keaton but unlike them they arent quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love if stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat then gosling on piano is her equal competitori have always preferred them alone one is happy being stubborn and intuitive something that she later on adapts from him and other being mature and hard on herself together they would fall apart they are meant to be no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall but despite of claiming it to be a this is the reality they had to get out,happy
im weak for musical movies even if the storyline sucks so this rating is slightly biasedi did cry after i first watched it because the ending made me feel like what a pity that its their dreams and goals that separate them but after the second watch i realized how foolish and unrealistic it was why arent they discussing their future career and relationship mindfully they keep arguing instead of calming down and talk respectfullynow emma and ryans chemistry was really good and it made me so attached to the movie despite the storyline their city of stars scene is iconic catchy and the lyrics so wishful yet hopelessalso these days i rarely see a movie with such an amazing poetic and theatrical cinematography before people are blaming me i was born in late 90s so there are definitely outstanding old movies that i havent seen yet this movie is such an eye candy with bold color palettes and unique anglesid still recommend people to watch this movie for their cinematography and for gods sake its musical,happy
a whimsical show of dance song and colour will whisk you away into a jazzy fairytale that you simply cannot afford to miss the 2016 film by damien chazelle entitled features mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling as the sensational duo that tell the tale of an aspiring actress and a passionate pianist in pursuit of their dreams and only end up achieving them by way of carefully composed choreography and perfectly penned lyricsthese two starving artists meet originally out of hatred for each other on a congested stretch of highway that catches them both in a sour mood during their morning commute from this point onwards an unexpected romance is slowly curated beneath the shadow of the hollywood sign that towers over their home town as both mia and sebastian spend all of their spare time outside of their crummy jobs playing small gigs or auditioning for minor roles in hopes of catching their big breaksthe actors emma stone and ryan gosling have an undeniable chemistry that breaches the realms of the screen and enters the hearts of the audience emma stone does an impeccable job of acting the role of an actress a role that could be considered strange because it is a role that she herself would have been in at the beginning of her own career and ryan goslings passionate performance is enough convert us all into a lover of the soulful jazz scene that his character so desperately wants to become a part ofthe score of this film will delight your ears the colourful costumes will entice your eyes and the overall storyline will run chills down your spine this is a film that presents the ability to engage all of your senses and if you feel at all lost in the pursuit of your own dream i strongly suggest you go watch this film as soon as humanly possible i can guarantee it will reignite the spark within you and have you dancing with anticipation to follow your dreams as soon as the end credits roll,happy
the affection and the magic of this movie touched me it was clean comedy without any gutter jokes or any crude references it was an extremely amazing musical one of the best ive ever watched its real while comedic and full of amazing vintage style and memories that would should never be lost emma stone and ryan gosling have aced it together emma stone is one of my favorite actresses and her has touched my heart oldies and newbies all of you watch it,happy
im an unashamed musical buff and ive rated this my fav screen musical of all time  along with being in my top three favourite movies of all time you know a movies worth seeing when its reviews are as polarising as this one the cinematography is outstanding every scene is crafted to perfection love love love the soundtrack too,happy
written and directed by damien chazelle was released exactly one year ago today in australia to say the least i was blown away by this film the cinematography is exciting the editing is timed perfectly the production design is simple vibrant and beautiful this movie is put together like a masterpiece the performances are so real and grounded particularly emma stone who never for a moment makes it known that she is an actor playing a character the depth of her emotion forms such a realistic and complex human being the music written by justin hurwitz is simply perfection this is one of my favourite movie scores of all time his music creates such complex emotions with his mixture of happiness and melancholy this is easily my favourite musical ever made this is because the characters and drama are not neglected at the expense of the musical numbers they a both intertwined beautifully each element is placed together with so much thought that it successfully transports the audience into such a deep emotional experience this film contains so much talent and creativity that it would be impossible not to give it a 10 i know a fair few people who really dislike this movie is not for your average audience its really for those who love and appreciate the craft of film,happy
is an amazing film starring one of my favorite actresses emma stone and another big celebrity ryan gosling this love story is simply not just a love story its not always so romantic even though its mainly about romance but this is the movie ive been looking for no wonder this film earned an oscar this movie was full of joy and sadness and good costumes for the characters showing how time changes and how magic sometimes fades but comes back again the characters were so true and i could feel the emotions throughout the way this film should be watched by every adult in america,happy
is a cinema triumph first of all this film is absolutely beautiful to look at the colours the framing the movement and the beautiful landscape of los angeles california gosling and stone give spectacular performances especially gosling who truly encapsulates a character who is so insanely passionate for his craft this film is a love letter to the dreamers of the world the ending is heartbreaking and breathtaking i highly recommend this film to anyone,happy
filled with sound and color captures hollywood in the most nostalgic way sometimes a little too much singing for me but so still so authentically artistic,happy
my favorite movie this movie is so wonderful the musics the photografic the direction emma stone is perfect is the best musical,happy
the incredible work and vision of the creator damien chazelle with seems to have surpassed expectations and the known problems of putting movie musicals togetheranother day of suna glaring beginning with song and dance on a crazy hot los angelas freeway bridge in the full heat of the day the first scene opens with dancing singing and acrobats setting the whole mood with the first words of the song in the middle of a traffic jam keeping both your eyes and ears glued to a scorching bridge over the freeway little by little youre given a chance to peak into the lives and circumstances of two struggling creatives who find each other through some very particular circumstances not once but 3 times their personalities seem to collide but they decide that there is an ironically funny circumstance driving them to be togethersomeone in the crowdis a cutely colorful para nostalgic style story that captures the unsaid hunger of those who set out on to make their way to make it in the entertainment business and get caught in life some end up breaking through the bonds of normal expectation and they get a few breaks some end up working a low paying job with very few benefits with just enough money to run from audition to audition for a movie rolea lovely nightin the style somewhat of fred estare and ginger rogers the eclectic version of the life of los angeles wannabe stars is played out by ryan gosling and emma stone all the scenes in this almost tangible movie musical make you want to be there you want to see the stars you want to smell the fresh air you want to dance and look over the edge of the hill to see downtown los angelas in the glowing hue of the sunsetcity of starsthe solo warm tones of piano with a lonely piano player who meets a great girl brings you into the essence of a romantic interlude appreciating the atmospheregaslights illuminate the boardwalk pier as ryan gosling strolls and sings offering a true performance of the professional he is the night seems to sing along with him he dances his way over the walk as the stars and the night become the best friend of sebastian the character he playslets start a firethe appearance of john legend is a surprise that lends to his first debut in a movie with a speaking part his music was impeccable for the scene lets start a firela la landpresents to us a fantasylike reality of los angeles dreamers and doers its a great movie musical that will stick in your mind for a long time with an eclectic version of original music by an artist like john legend and other music written by academy award winning composers like benj pasek justin paul and more,happy
lets start off with all the absolutely incredible things about its probably one of the ten most visually appealing movies of all time every camera angle every carefully planned twist and turn is just beautiful and duh the music is 1010 spectacular the ending is also just out of this world superb unfortunately just takes too long to actually get decent emma stones character is so static and boring ryan gosling is great and a version with just him could have been different but ultimately their romance is bland and cliche i see what all the initial appeal was about but now it just seems like will he forgotten in time,happy
is a film that i never want to stop watching i have watched this movie with my friends 2 times in our movie nights because it is a full of powerful fascinating music and feels you the sadness wisdom and joy i think the best scene of this movie is a magical love between a beautiful actress and a good piano player guy and if youre a person who is keen on love romance you might want to watch good luck,happy
i will be up front about the fact that i watched this for emma stone im not a musical or jazz fan so i cant comment onthat however the story is fine in fact its good i dont see why people have an issue with the ending its a realistic ending im sure that this kind of situation is not uncommon in reality and the main characters seemed to be mature enough to be positive about it ending aside the course of the story is engaging enough the various ongoings as the characters take different positions on the pursuit of career as time evolves i dont get why people have a problem with the story or the ending,happy
yet it worked perfectly in setting mood and lifting my spirits very high quality delicately made film works in all facets flaws people found are people pulling for straws at best,happy
in a world where people worship everything and value nothing i have found that i value the many messages present within 2016 while simultaneously shining a harsh light on the hypocrisy of hollywood and showing how our dreams and passions move us to make tough life decisions i found myself deeply moved by the narrative presented within this film not only as a lover of movies but as a creative artist myself this film is for the dreamers its for the people who never give up in pursuing what they want out of life its for those who have a talent screaming to be noticed by othersaside from literally being the best musical ive seen in nearly more than a decade chicago 2002 is the only recent one that comes to mind what i found most impressive about this film is that it is only the second directed by damien chazelle for those who may have missed it his previous work whiplash 2014 was an extreme look at the commitment a musician will take just to be a part of something bigger with this in mind we find that chazelle has a passion for music that is easily grasped through his use of expert cinematographymuch like the young girls of rochefort 1967 makes me feel like the world would be a much better place if people sang and danced at the drop of a hat or stop of a car but even with the almost cliche romantic comedy beginning where differs from these films is the depth that it explores the relationships between two dreamers while we always want our life partners to succeed in their dreams it can be difficult to find a balance between somewhat contrasting goalsa mustsee film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life i give 50 stars out of 5,happy
it took me a few years to actually sit down and watch this but maybe it was because i didnt truly understand just how incredible it was everything from the music and dance to the outstanding acting and excellent plot put this fighting to be one of my favorite films ever,happy
i loved the movie up until you find out the endingwriters and i am one seem to have become enamored with doing away with the happy endings their audience want and did this exact thingthe story was simple but nice the singing dancing music and acting were exceptional and well in keeping with the old hollywood extravaganzas like singing in the rainthe ending to this movie while not completely sad certainly wasnt the happy ending i think most people wanted to see and for me turned a happy experience into a sad onei wish i had rented it instead of buying it because i likely wont be watching it again,happy
for a film that has numerous credits i found this to be a tedious bore after an hour it was replaced by something more exciting and uplifting an episode on hannay from the 70s unless youre into musicals i wouldnt bother what everyone saw in this isnt clear bland,happy
just watched this again on netflix after watching it back im 2016when i watched it for the first time i hated the ending today almost 3 years later ending was perfect to methis movie is beautiful because the ending wasnt typical and it also showed mias perspective of what if with beautiful score musicthere are several long take scenes and those are just breathtaking i could see all the hard work that has been put in the film in every aspect music acting set color angles directing and etc it came all together to form onebeautifulnow i am off to purchase a dvd,happy
im so sick of people giving this movie bad reviews even if you didnt like the movie dont go on twitter and say this is a pice of garbage or this is the worst movie ive ever seen just cause your friend said it was have your own goddam opion for once please,happy
this movie is an absolute pleasure to watch it is one of the most visually gorgeous movies ive ever seen and the cinematography is second to none emma stone and ryan gosling both give excellent layered and hilarious performances as mia and sebastian throughout the film you really get to know the characters and by the end you really care about them this film is intended as a love letter to the golden days of cinema and i think it does this with brilliance and effortless charm the soundtrack is phenomenal all of the musicaldance numbers are visualy breathtaking and the choreography is awesome this movie has some heart wrenching emotional scenes while pulling off the comedic vibe with ease theres not much this film doesnt do its pretty hard to fault to be honest this film is definitely worthy of its oscar wins and truly is a masterpiece,happy
written and directed by damian chazelle charts the dreams of the stage struck miaemma stone and sebastian ryan gosling as the struggle to establish themselves in tinsel town unlikely lovers whose paths cross accidentally we follow them from the aspirational bottom of their respected heaps as an aspiring film actress who is frequently auditioned but never gets the part and a gifted improvisational jazz pianist who is playing christmas carols in a basement bar and finding impossible to stick to the set list of standard merry festive songsthe film opens with an impromptu song and dance number that erupts naturally enough from a traffic jam on the el camino real and sets the whole tone of the filmas the two become closer emotionally they share their dreams for the future with one another giving each other the confidence and encouragement they both need to take the risks they need to take and to weather the storms when their dreams dont materialise at the first trytorn apart geographically despite their separate financial success they nevertheless continue to support each others dreams and refuse to give upits a great film that leads them up into the air on wires as their love blossoms and the celluloid of a classic film snaps it even has the clich of health and wealth but no happiness as there is a bitter sweet ending in sebs jazz club that mia blunders into by accident with her husbandjust a great wellcrafted musically seamless film where the musicstruck and stagestruck very nearly get to live out their dreams together but not quite,happy
i should start by saying that this is the only movie i can remember that i have watched it back to back nightsthe story and the performances are very good but the music and the ending of the movie are the reason for being such an addictive moviewell done,happy
in terms of music styling choreography and acting this movie was brilliant utterly amazing and a big tribute i feel like to the old hollywood movies but i couldnt help but feel like it lacked something the love story that evolved between ryan and emmas characters felt a tiny bit forced in the beginning but i still have to give props for the two since i cant remember seeing these two step dance and sing in a movie before there was nothing wrong with the actors i think the story just might have been flawed these thoughts were all in my head until the last scene that hit me incredibly hard even though the love story felt abit forced in the beginning you really could se these two characters end up together forever but at the same time when that didnt happen that felt okay too just because you met a person at one of your lower points in life doesnt mean that you are meant for eachother and i praise the director for taking that decision i was almost one hundre percent certain that mia was going to turn around march toward sebastian have a big reunion kiss and then live happily ever after but when i instead was greeted with the sad and at the same time perfectly happy smiles from both emma and ryan i felt strangely contentwhile i wouldnt call this one of my favorites i still would defnately watch it again for the music and all out experience,happy
i saw this film a few months after it came outand really enjoyed itjust caught it again on tv tonight and i really think its a great filmyes its to quote other reviews cheesy in plenty of places schmaltzy in othersbut it is for all the right reasons theres a for the love of hollywood cinema about the story and where it is set it is unashamed in that regard and that works for meto have too many films of the same theme or take on cinema that this has would quickly run out of steam but as it sits alone and is unique enough makes it all the more of a gemthe criticism in the imdb reviews is often a little too harsh each to their own but this film does require you to want to believe in it and get swept along to really get the most from itgreat film that can even be watched again and again in the future,happy
one of the best films of late the history of sebastian and mia shows what a real desire for your dream is and that sometimes you have to sacrifice even something very expensive for it i really liked the movie be sure to revise it yet,happy
the introductory scene had me hyped for large precisely choreographed crowd dance routines instead the story rapidly zooms down to the two main characterstheres a lot of charm and nostalgic wonder to this film its a classic story of desperately passionate people trying to catch a break in cruelly beautiful world but i cant help but lament the lack of actual musical scenesfor once this is a musical where the story comes first its a refreshing change but a little jarring,happy
youll leave with a tear in your eye and a song in your heart,happy
im not fond of romantic movies but touched me amazing acting and singing make a fun campy romantic musical that anyone could watch and love this movie is a modern classic and will stay so for ages to come,happy
i dont normally like musicals but this filmwow this film has such strong meaning and music the music is just beautiful city of stars and the main theme the rolls around in the scene of the planetarium or at the ending just take your breath away and it hits you right in the heart in my opinion ryan gosling and emma stone have solid performances maybe emma stone with 1 over gosling but still both of them very solid and a big respect for ryan upgrading his piano skills for this role both have nice and beautiful voices but again i will give emma stone a 1 over ryan gosling what i really liked is that even though the movie is sad in the end it is very realistic how lots of people separate because of their dreams and its real shame but some find happiness and something better and new it is a really lovely movie,happy
was not too bad the strengths of this film are the acting performances gosling and emma stone hit it out of the park and bring a very simple story to lifeit is nice to see a musical like this in the 21st century the 50s and 60s saw a whole bunch of successful musicals released and then there was a decrease this musical cannot obviously be compared to powerhouses like my fair lady or mary poppins but it is somewhat decent arguably chazelles best work to date his films have not been particularly good he is a mediocre film maker so this marks a big improvement what i also liked was how this was not a silly romance but something different7510,happy
a moving tribute to the golden age of hollywood a love story and a movie about jazz it stuns with music dancing and love its a pity ryan gosling lacks natural panache of dance but he tried,happy
this movie is refreshing and entertaining i loved every scene from the first to the last and it left me crying at the end the nostalgia and love story are both delightful and heartbreaking i loved the colors and scenery it was a nice break from most of what hollywood is producing these days,happy
i like it so much when i watch i fell like im in sky i think no one can make movie like it its a piece of fantasy finally i dont know what i say but its great movie ,happy
just did that from the beginning it is so amazing moving and touching,happy
after watching it a million times over i still cant get why its so underratedit has a beautiful plot line and captivating scenery if you love romance and musicals this is definitely your cup of tea,happy
as someone who majored in theater in college its probably a nobrainer that i love musicals as great as onstage musicals are there is just something about a musical being put on camera that makes it extra excitingit took me a while to see but with all of the talk and hype it was getting i know that i had to the movie was great the story line was sweet the chemistry between gosling and stone was so real as it always is and dont even get me started on the colors if there was one thing that ket me engaged this entire movie it was how colorful it was the set wardrobe lighting everything was so bright and bold i couldnt take my eyes off of the screenas much as i did enjoy this movie my rating wasnt as high is others because at some points i found myself getting a little bored even with the two amazing actors and the bright colors that i loved so much my interest in the movie went in and out as i was watching it i wish i knew what it was exactly that took me out of the film maybe the sweet story line wasnt exciting enough for me maybe watching it at home led to too many distractions maybe i should have seen it before all of the eye so my expectations werent so high im not sure but even with the moments of disinterest is still a great musicalfilm and id still recommend my fellow musical lovers to see it if not for the movie in its entirety then for gosling stone and all of the beautiful colors,happy
and the ending was bad tbh i think in that kind of movies the ending must be more happy,happy
this film was one the most talked about films of 2016 but was it overrated personally i think in some parts yes and some parts no and if youre not a fan of broadway or west end musicals then this film is definitely not for youthe art of film was fantastic and i can not fault one bit the picture the songs choreography  and the acting was also great but did they really need such big actors honestly i dont think so it was like being in a theatre  so many other actors and actresses would have taken on the role perfectly and maybe even made the film better another thing the story line it was so basic a typical love story that was actually quite underwhelmingthere was such a hype for this film and it really left me a little disappointed the only thing that stood out was the visuals for me it was just a lovely cinematic film but everything else was then left average and that was not what i was expecting from an award winning film that was displayed and talked about all over the world,happy
i love this movie its magical colorful gorgeous dreamy and features beautiful locations in california i know a lot of the filming locations very well so i can reminiscing them by watching i assume that this film attracts mainly people who are related to los angeles ive read some people find awful because they can not stand hollywood  lasince my heart is in california it totally appeals to me and gives me pleasurethe story is about passion dream chasing and fulfilling dreams vs reality love and the true aspect of the showbiz in hollywoodis an homage to the old hollywood and a great lovestory about ladirector damien chazelle had put many years of work and love into this movieonly the end i can not understand and i think its a shame i wouldve like a slightly different ending why do you cant have botha dream job and a fulfilling relationship it doesnt have to be a shallow happy end but what about some more positive vibesanyway is a heck of a film that deserves a watchthe soundtrack is amazing by the way,happy
i am not sure of being the best critic as i did not watch it reason why i am not rating it but i would like to say why i didnt i had tried to watch mamma mia when it was aired and although i like abba and meryl streep i didnt feel it i understood the intent of celebrating abba and trying to make a modern musical but i couldnt feel any soul i always liked musicals like singing in the rain or grease as it seemed to be the reflect of a generation it just didnt work here so i stopped after fifteen minutes inspite of the great casti then took a chance on but what stroke me from the very first pictures is that it was pretty much the same ambiance as mamma mia except that the first song is completely off key i therefore did not watch further than the first minutes i guess it is more for a young audience who dont have the former musicals as a reference,happy
yes this movies music is beautiful and yes ryan and emma will forever be my favorite movie couple and yes it begins really intriguingly but come onthe endlike i expected morei would love for the couple to end up together i mean all of us would and they didnt so i wasnt pumped for that but concerning the vibes and aesthetic and songs and mood its the perfect movie,happy
just didnt understand why all the fuss about that movie what am sure of is that it definitely doesnt deserve an oscar for best actres there was nothing special about it,happy
when you look at musicals as a genre the train of thought is immediately followed by a cheesy and cheeky end that you mightve seen on any other film this doesnt have any this does however contradict logic a couple of times but movie is meant not to be perfect but to encourage perfectness i despise musicals but now after watching this i must refute from my claim partially this movie has a charm an aura beautiful colors and beguiling melody jazz is jazzing throughout the movie the reverberations the claps the beats the shakes the chords all blend into unison to concieve a piece as great as this audio though was a little brittle dont know if its universal or for the theatre i watched in watch it if you love musicals and watch it if you hate them,happy
musicals arent my thing and i thought it was another gaudy musical but the second half of the movie changed my mind and inspired me to stay a dreamer also it made me cry a little bit,happy
the movie is just amazing it can be compared with singing in the rain the photography and the colours are beautiful its not perfect but its close to,happy
i must admit i hate musicals but had to see what all fuss was about not convertedi hate musicals even more now not because of the whole stupid bursting into song part i hate musicals even more now because the characters in this film are so annoying and unlikable and selfish films can have annoying and selfish characters and thats what makes it interesting its just a problem when the filmmakers present them so we are meant to like themi like emma stone she is a usually very likable she is a good actress but i cant believe she won oscar for playing such a self absorbed annoying person also if you win an oscar for a part in a musical movie shouldnt you be able to sing and dance better than wife doing karaoke ryan gosling character is even more unlikable why do we care about these people why should we care hollywood just loves films about itself i guess i must admit city of stars song is pretty catchy i actually want it out of my head510,happy
a movie well appreciated by movie lovers and critics alike is a truly stunning piecedirected by damien chazelle a young director who has the potential to be one of hollywood greatest shows us the life of two struggling people who fall in love together one is an aspiring actress and another one is an amateur jazz player its shows struggle of an individual person to be seen to make a mark in their world mostly it is about love and how two people show it to each otherthe dancing scenes at the opening scene and between ryan gosling and emma stone is fantastically choreographed its shows the movie has flavour and boldness a soundtrack that is even more amazing and sometimes emotional in the scenes which needed emotion to be played brilliantthe costume design and the locations are choosen well enough to make the movie spectacular a movies needs all of these to be greatdamien chazelle makes this movie so emotional that you get attached to it and feelings so strong that wants you you see more of this bittersweet dramafeel happy about this moviemoreover the acting is right at the notch ryan goslings performance was stulish and showed his versatility emma stones award was award winning and showed her ravishing actingall about this movie is great and that is why this movie deserves 8 stars,happy
normally i did not even like romantic and musical films but deserves all the best feelings in deep of heart this wonderful and heart warming movie is the one that everyone can see and feel himself in it both leading role actors are so good that you can not help yourself to keep your tears at the same time of the scenes that they cyr at least that happened to me as of a horror movie fan i watched it with tears honestly speaking i dont know what will happen to no other kind of movie fans you should definitely watch it do not hesitate,happy
please dont listen to the ones who tell you that this is not worth it this movie literally changed my life it is full of passion dreams hope and extraordinary music it absolutely deserves to be watched above all because of the magnificent performance of emma stone that perfectly deserved her oscareveryone has a dream and this is a film for dreamers for people that struggle everyday in order to realize their aims and trust me you cant die without having watched this marvelous masterpiece,happy
between reaching your dreams and staying with the one you love which choice do you make stone and goslings characters develop a true love one bound by music and appreciation for eachothers artistry but like real relationships small cracks start to appear when the characters choose one over the othersuddenly their dreams seem too far apart this movie does a great job of romanticising the concept of finding a true love only to have it crashing down the final moments of the movie are the most powerful ive seen in a completely different way than the titanic never has a romance movie shown the feeling of regret so captivatinglythe cinematography and location is also beautiful the one shot take of the jazz band and the dancing scenes are gorgeous and the movie leaves you feeling nostalgic,happy
wonderful music direction cinematography and so on this film is endlessly watchable and equally as brilliant each time fantastically structured with great performances aside from all criticism of the singing and dancing theres so much going for this release the fantastical dream sequence alternate ending is heartbreaking and beautiful its main theme is extremely touching and warm and the leads are great whats not to like,happy
i wasnt sure i wanted to watch this  this sort of musical isnt normally my sort of thing in the event i enjoyed it a lot more than i expected tothe big question at the heart of the film is whether you should follow your passion in life or whether you should stay with the love of your life in that respect it is the same as cinema paradiso the two leads are very good the last two scenes in the film what might have been and the look between them are great  but not as good as the last scene in cinema paradiso,happy
directed by the extremely talented damien chazelle is a perfect amalgam of old school musical with a grounded story which lets us know that things always dont work out even though it is something weve all seen before the movie is fresh its a breath of fresh air into the dying musicalmovies we rarely get such wonderfully crafted films let alone musicals the soundtrack is great the performances are excellent and the direction is superb it shows us that even if things dont work out in the end its fine everything will be alright eventually and that we should not hesitate to dream on ever,happy
so the obvious both visually and audibly this movie is nothing short of stunning the colour palette the score the costumes all practically flawless and with great traditional stage lighting to support what amounts to a very beautifully constructed piece of cinematographythe dialogue was a little too smart at times but it never strayed so far off the beaten path to pull me out of the experience the characters were likable even if they seemed to go for the all too common trope of characters that are only flawed because other characters tell you they are whereas throughout the entire movie they practically make no missteps in any capacityspeaking of characters the leads were brilliantly acted but didnt feel quite as fleshed out as i would have liked the leads both gosling and stone stole the show and the chemistry between them never felt forced to me secondary characters were entirely forgettable and i struggle to recall a single notable onethe plot was entirely competent nothing groundbreaking  but then i dont really feel it has to be after all moonlight and lovesongs are never out of datein summary a great way to spend two hours themes felt a bit heavy handed at times but the film was a feast for both eyes and ears and its worth catching,happy
de las mejores fotografas de la historia del cine,happy
what is the point of having a whatif film i mean there could be a million whatifs what is they didnt release this film what is she is lactose intolerant what is he is not into jazz but likes rap and hip hop ie hates music who caresit seems like the oscars latches on to rubbish movies and then hypes it up because there is a lack of actually good movies look at this or birdman or the shape of water my goodness,happy
this movie is about a jazz musician an actress and their romance there are many scenes of singing and dancing and good this film is good for people who love performing artsbut the most important theme i think is love when it isthe love for sounds it is music when for theatre it is acting when for a person it is romance and through the love the 2 character grow up and purchase their dreamsthis movie inspired me into loving acting and standup comedy when you love something  that could be your dreamill recommend this to everybody who love something and who wants to love something,happy
try to remember your childhood dreams of someday being in the moviesthis movie is about you and your struggle to make them come true,happy
ive always hate musical movies but thiswhoever give this movie below 810 just simply has zero taste in movies whatsoever,happy
honestly i think high school musical is more enjoyable than thisemma stone is hot af as alwayseverything else is cliche after cliche also their fight makes no senseand why cant ryan gosling just have a smooth and happy relationship in movies,happy
is the type of movie i hate starting to watch its not because i hate movie musicals quite the opposite in fact what i dislike intensely is those films that use the old hollywood movie genres like those old screwball comedies or the old musicals as a basis and then proceed to get them wrong down with love anyone thats exactly what i thought would happen with this movie i couldnt have been more wrong the film as well as being visually stunning is full of characters that you want to spend time with especially that of emma stone her character mia is played fantastically to my mind this performance from stone ranks with her best thats not to say that ryan gosling isnt also good because he is the songs if not completely in the style of the old hollywood musicals given the films contemporary setting stay true to their essence and the story is engaging too much like pirates of the caribbean and the artist breathed life into longdead genres i think will give those people who dont really give movie musicals a second glance a new appreciation is a delightful modern movie musical and im sorry i ever doubted it,happy
after hearing hype about this movie from critics and friends alike my friends and i went to see it expecting to be blown away as a huge fan of modern musicals i thought i would really enjoy this after it ended however my friend and i both felt kind of meh about the movie heres whymaybe its just not really my cup of tea but i thought both the story and the characters were boring there are long shots of gosling and stone just staring at the camera goslings character is incredibly snobby about jazz and how it should be kept pure which is kind of annoying even though a lot of people praise the chemistry between the two leads personally i didnt feel it and i still dont really understand the point of the overly long observatory dance sequence whyneither the two leads nor the ensemble are really good singers any broadway actor or even some of the people in my high school theatre group are more capable of performing in a movie musical while the ensemble dancers were fabulous gosling and stones dancing was just mediocre again hiring professional musical theatre performers might have helped add some shine to a lackluster story i dont really like city of stars and hearing it played 7 times throughout the movie definitely didnt make me like it more the song from moana and the audition song were both better contenders for best original song in my opinion i know im in the minority herehowever here are some things i liked a lotmost of songs are very good and ive added many of them to my musical playlist on spotify i know pasek and paul are incredible based on their work in dear evan hansen and the greatest showman so that is no surprise the music and lyrics shine despite the ok singing so even though im not a fan of city of stars i really like the music in this movie the instrumental stuff is amazing the jazz was delightful to listen to and so was goslings piano playing i love the ending by the last half hour i really thought this was going to be another boy meets girl they fall in love both achieve their dreams and stay together forever cliche ending that they didnt end up together was both a surprising twist and a refreshing representation of what real life is like sometimes you have to choose between the career of your dreams and a relationship and this movie showed that beautifully,happy
a movie that should have won picture of the year is a movie about hope it is a love story and big dreams sometimes you dont end up where you thought you would but in the end it is the experiences that make the journey worth while i love the tender scenes of this young couple in love it gives you a hope for a better tomorrow and not to worry in the end it all works out,happy
the songs are great but the fact that there are so few that are actually sung is disappointing because after all its a musical and at first the story was going great but then after 45 minutes it felt quite bland the worst part of this movie was the ending like wow that sucked,happy
being a working class hairy bottomed meat eating and somewhat a stereotypical male neanderthal i was blown away by this film i was encouraged forced to watch by my daughter and from the get go was fascinated by the use of colour and although this film is contemporary it has the feel of the great musicals of yesteryear i loved the use of cars from several decades mixed with clothing and film studio backgroundsscenery to give the impression that the film is set in one of several decades the acting is superb and dispite my cynicism the music is well crafted and again crosses the decades in composition and feel cant say anything negative about this film and for all those like myself who would rather nail a leg to a church pew on easter sunday than watch a chick flickmusical just watch it and between the soundtrack visuals and emma stones hypnotic beauty youll be sold you may not want to admit it but youll be humming that tune for weeks the best thing ive seen in years with a superb ending im off to take a flower arranging course as i am now in touch with my feminine side,happy
these movie has been reviewed from a dozen angles but i want to highlight the los angeles aspect new york has had a number of movies made about it that have the city as a central character but while la of course has had many movies set in it few of those are love letters movies that revel in the appearance of the city and want to display it to best effect till now my favorite example of the genre has been la story but is an even more beautiful version of the same idea an ongoing attempt to highlight different parts of la and to show them all under the most gorgeous possible conditions if you live in the city its a treat to try to figure out each location so thats my recommendation if you want to see a movie that does la proud that shows how lovely the city can be watch this the only shame is that there so many additional locations that could have been added but werent ,happy
but i think the notebook ryan is better than thisand personally i like ryan,happy
beautiful music and lovely storiei love jazz and this was a movie about it it turns me into another world love it,happy
the best part of the movie is emma stones cute little quirky dance to the i ran song trying to get back at ryan goslings character after that it goes downhill for me and it just seems like every other rom commusical ive ever seen i gave it four stars for that scene alone that scene definitely should have won an oscar,happy
this film was biggest fu to hollywood everthe oscars joke was so good and just deserved for any director who has balls to make this filmthis films end tribute to fairytail hollywood romance is amazing so wish they would make that film you much watch youtbe film referrenced in lala landalso moolight was a terrible film and no way oscar worthy if you have not seen it then your lucky,happy
some people hate musicals this isnt a musical its a story about following your love or following your dream or both but can you have both what would you do,happy
since this movie won two academy awards and two golden globes for the music i expected to be devastated by the musical score musically it has some nice songs but it did not come close to the holiday rocky secretariat superman wonder woman and i could name many more it was more on the order of moulin rouge but even there musically it still fell very far short story wise it left more than a lot to be desired first the ending is more like a david lynch movie and leaves one wondering where the dream ends and the reality is that is not a major negative but it is a little annoying then of course there is a lot of the story left out near the end so it again leaves one wondering if this is realityhow did we get here i wanted to see the rest of the story that was left out near the end then of course the ending is not motivational rather it is more realisticand the movie sets us up for something magical that we were hoping to be wonderful in other words the ending is a let down from the direction the movie was heading,happy
the reason why this has become one of my favorite movies is not just because of the music the colors or that it is directed by damien chazelle the reason why i love this movie so much is because of its untraditional ending the movie is about struggling actress named mia played by emma stone and a struggling musician who wants to start a nightclub named sebastian played by ryan gosling the movie is about their relationship and how they both have dreams that they are devoted to and both want each other to succeed their relationship goes through many twists and turns and that is what i believe jazz represents in this movie some of my friends have also seen the movie and always say oh its just a love story with music i prefer whiplash in the movie jazz represents their entire relationship jazz is a unpredictable type of music and you never know what will happen next and that is the way mia and sebastians relationship moves also in the movie you see the difference of how mias and sebastians relationship compared to their friends relationship going back to what i had said before this movie is all about the ending it is not your classic and they all lived happily ever after each of the characters get what they wanted but they dont end up together it is bitter sweet and not what you were expecting and was definitely not cliche if this movie ended with mia and sebastian together this movie would have just been a cute romcom but instead it is something much greater,happy
when i first encountered it was due to the confusion at the 2017 oscars hosted by jimmy kimmel who did in my opinion a terrible job i was not planning to watch but if it gets an oscar and then taken back from them i couldnt let that opportunity fly away now i wasnt expecting much from this movie i knew it would be a romance musical sort of movie but it was more than that i dont know what it was but after watching the movie i felt confused and happy the movie itself was a wonderland of joy and hate but soon enough moving on when i first started watching the movie within the first 10 minutes i thought to myself wow this is gonna be a long confusing movie and after that i was proven wrong the characters themselves made me love the movie ryan goslings performance was truly amazing and the same can be said about emma stones 1010 performance the story line was great it included both hate and love and you dont see enough movies do that but to close this off i wanna talk about the ending now the ending made me angry filled with hatred for how emma had someone else but the flashback scene made me think that the director gave us two options you either see emma with ryan or them two separate and him giving us that option made me felt amazing,happy
after the fuss about this i was expecting a wellpaced heartwarming mesmerising film but frankly i was bored rigid as were the rest of the family the dances are passable for your average amateur production and ive seen amateur productions with much better but a homage to astaire and rogers or even a second rate 50s musical theyre not a bit of hopping about and swinging her round and thats your lot the music is pleasant enough but instantly forgettableplot well you follow two pleasant enough but essentially bland characters for a while she swears she will always love him then finds someone else without a backward glance he gets to play his jazz thats about it but because it drifts through with all the dynamism of a spacedout sloth it takes ages,happy
lots of people have been asking if ive seen so i thought i had better give it a chance even though musicals arent my thing  better late than never right i always list the four most prominent actors when i do a review but i truly struggled to think of anyone else to fill the 3rd  4th slots since this film has two stars and at least one of them is on screen the entire time with little time dedicated to anythinganyone else maybe not a bad thing but it does mean the film gets a bit monotonoussebastian gosling and mia stone are easy to watch and are good in this but i dont think either of them is a particularly good singer or dancer my main problem with musicals is why if a scenes not interesting enough to sustain momentum without having song and dance then cut it at least in animated films they seem to find ways to weave songs in organically  and theyre catchy here i didnt find any of the songs very catchy or interesting  most are kind of mopey otherwise its all quite predictable  they fall in love they chase their dreams the endthe ending is semiinteresting but every time i started to get pulled into the film when theres a stretch with no singing it suddenly appears again  always out of context  and pushes me back out its definitely not a bad film i just felt like nothing really happened  sure theres some romance and theyre good actors but theres no real story or humour to be found,happy
okay so it was quite disappointing my mother and i were compulsively waiting to see this movie when we got to see it at home we were like really excited when the movie started i liked it a dancing scene like in the other movies but as the movie went on i actually started to doubt all those newspapers and news that said this was oscar worthyseb was constantly talking about jazz and that was quite annoying he worked on something he didnt like for 5 years or more if the movie went on and kept telling himself it was his passion seriously then he picked on mia because apparently she liked him when he was worthless because that made him feel better i didnt get it then for 5 years they dont speak to each other even though if it wasnt because of seb mia wasnt even an actress how is that possible i will never stop loving you okay then at least try to be friends not just stop speaking for 5 years or whatever until they finally meet at the club mia named and both regret the choices they made in life good joband what was that at the ending just a simple nod i think that what most disappointed me was the ending i am a compulsive happy ending lover and an ending when both girl and boy dont stay together is basically a failure in history of cinema but seriously there were so bad things about the movie i of course liked the beggining it was a magical relationship when both go out and explore and dance and listen to jazz the whole day a true fairy tale but seb ruins it with his new job the musics arent that good i mean the first song and city of stars are basically the only songs that i liked the others i cant even remember them the last scene where mia and seb get to see what wouldve happened if they were different was when i cried if you are going to make a musical please insert a backstory and if you want to win a few more smiles include a happy and decent endingi feel like ive been tricked this wasnt the movie everyone spoke about and everyone wanted to see this wasnt the movie i imaginedagain i think that what most disappointed me was the ending as i like happy endings in fact i mostly like boy and girl stay together endings i would see this movie again but in like 5 years 50,happy

honestly what the hell was thatworst movie maybe ever,happy
consider by some a great musical and by others simply a waste of time in my opinion is the non perfect hollywood movie every classic made hollywood had the perfect ending not this one this movie shows the reality in the present work and dreams came in first place not lovethere are some very good aspects in this moviethe dancing and the soundtrack the vocals have some trouble specialy ryans are amazing some times nostalgic other times joyfullhowever as said before the vocals are sometimes a problem and this is a very important point because this is a musicalis this worthy of an oscar yes it is,happy
if you were into films around 2016 you would have heard of even if you were just a causal movie goer you would have at least heard the name people werestill are  in love with this film so much so in fact that there was popular backlash to during the time leading up and after the oscars only now has this backlash appeared to have vanished this was partly the reason why i someone who loves musicals did not see sooner i wanted to wait until things had cooled down tells the tale of a struggling actress mia emma stone and wannabe jazz musician sebastianryan gosling crossing paths and falling in love in the back drop of hollywood and trying to keep themselves together as professional ambition threatens to drive the two apart i love musicals always have done one of my favorite movies is singing in the rain and is a clear inspiration spiritual successor to the 1952 classic that if anything was one of the biggest selling points for and i think it does it very well from the opening song and dance number to sebastian and mia tap dancing against a sun setting bathed hill breathes singing in the rain that has just enough identity of its own so it does not rip off the inspiration but respect and honor it there is not one musical number that feels out of place or does not add to the movie in some form which i do think is an improvement to singing in the rain which did suffer from some dance numbers that felt like padding looking at you broadway melodys plot might not be the most complex plot in the world but it is compelling and is well paced the music numbers do not feel out of place and do not derail the plot in any way as well as being spaced out enough so both can exist without diminishing the other mia and sebastian are interesting and likeable ryan gosling and emma stone give it their all in terms of performances the romance not only feels believable but also goes to different places then singing in the rain took its romance in a ending that is bittersweet and poignant the ending helps the movie stand apart from its inspiration and give it its own identity i love it unfortunately as a true successor to singing in the rain falls short by one key factor the dancing the dance choreography is weak and stilted in comparison to other musicals especially to singing in the rain which as most would know was well known for its ground breaking dance numbers another reason why most the dancing is weak would be because none of the main stars were professional dancers ryan gosling did take dancing lessons for this movie not sure about emma stone so the dancing would be very simple and a little out of step with the music which is almost always upbeat and cheerful the choreography could have been better if it was going to be a real successor to singing in the rain but without the comparison it is fine not the best but works well enough is a great musical i would not say that it is one of the best movie musicals but it is one hell of an enjoyable watch a must see for any musical fan,happy
as a musical excellent beautiful wonderful choreography bright colors bravoas a moviei actually avoided seeing for quite some time because the plot seemed thin and trite to me as someone who had lived in los angeles for nearly a decade im not exactly swept away by tales of aspiring performers to me thats just real life and this pair of struggling performers seemed especially privilegedthough highly amused by people singing and dancing on the freeway it might be the best or second best scene in the entire film and completely in love with how much the director decided to use griffith park the real happiest place on earth i was distracted by the fact that a barista drove a prius and lived in an art deco apartment and that an underemployed pianist not only could afford to live without roommates in presentday la but could afford the gas to drive a car around town instead of taking public transportation hey i know the film is called see the aforementioned people dancing on the freeway without dying brutal deaths but this aspect made the film seem outright classist to me as an angeleno i inwardly stewed over the preposterous detachment of reality the writers and directors must have to even suggest such a scenario while these things may have been possible in 1983 this movie was made in 20152016 and it aint happening unless you have a trust fund the film coasted along merrily and was certainly better than average i enjoyed the jazz music and the multiple shots of alleyways and trashcans and back entrancesbut a huge chunk of la was completely erased the characters only seemed to know west la hermosa beach and griffith parkthere were no realistic scenes of trudging through north hollywood nor were there really any memorable shots of the historic core in dtla except for angels flight there was no hint of latino culture no trains no ubers no hotelsthis film was not written by anyone with a recent experience of being a struggling millennial trying to enjoy life in los angeles pool parties at mansions umokaaaaay i was rooting for the happy couple but by films end i felt dismayed and betrayed by emma stones character not only did she abandon ryan gosling for some upper middle class ken doll cutout of a husband and a baby but she even seems to have abandoned los angeles casually groaning i dont miss this to freeway traffic and intimating how it might be easier to catch a play back in new yorktruthfully i did feel more connected to ryan goslings la loyal jazz loving character fulfilling his dream at the end by owning his own jazz club in cozy spot somewhere just off the freeway ramp but overall im giving this film a 7 yes its better than average yes id watch it again but its not the best film ive ever seen and on a personal level theres something about it that vaguely unsettles me,happy
having waited a year since its original release before i finally saw it meant that i could watch it without the typical oscars hype that surrounded it and frankly i just dont get what the hype was all aboutthe story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams now a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing  neither of which are present here the songs are repetitive as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious and stone and goslings singingintheshower warbles certainly didnt dazzle this viewer in fact their restrained musical performances are an embarrassment to the resplendent costumes and sets that surround themwhats worst however is that its potential did shine through there are two or three dramatic scenes between stone and gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest its not a bad film by any standards just very painfully and shamefully averagefinally i watch enough strictly come dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of emma stones hands during her final musical number with ryan gosling but thats being quite picky isnt it,happy
perhaps it was all the hype but i came away from viewing a bit underwhelmed yes it was a fun film with some heart and the whole family can enjoy it it does remind you of films from hollywoods better days how often do we get to see a scriptto screen musical i understand that some members of the academy perhaps wanted to encourage more of this kind of film making and id like to see more as well that said this is not a great film it does have its moments the story is bittersweet and the cinematography is wonderful  la hasnt looked this good in a long time i enjoyed the music especially the theme track theres a lot of energy in this film and it keeps you interested from beginning to end but i dont think the final product deserves all the oscars even if ive never thought much of them anyway everything is done well even really well at times the lead actors are earnest and likable were rooting for them but it doesnt add up in the end i found the progression of the plot in the final 30 minutes to be a bit of a stretch these two were never really meant for each other i found their friendship much more believable than their romance neither actor is a skilled dancer musician or singer they pulled it off but their performances arent memorable viewing was a fun two hours but im not interesting in watching it a second time,happy
it is very hard to make a movie better then this this is a very beautiful film and a fantasitic love story amazing writing combined with superb acting with gosling and stones on screen chemistry you think they would have known each other for their whole lives the whole musical turned me off at first but i recommend everyone see this movie,happy
absolutely beautiful and colourful such a joy to look at with popping colours and stylish costumes a lot of effort when into every single shot which i fully appreciatethe music is phenomenal with city of stars being my new favourite song from a musical i thought there would be more songs but the ones in the film are so catchy and upbeat both emma and ryan did great jobs with the singing and acting each making the characters feelings come aliveit also uses cinematography fantastically my favourite shot being the powerful audition scene the sky effect is very beautiful love the purplish night dance scene so excited for my next watch of it,happy
emma stone and ryan gosling sing dance and act which is impressive however each independent part is just fine and i say this knowing that she won an oscar for her performancethe visual style is beautiful and theatrical particularly the lightning camerajob and special effects resemble the experience of theatre rather than cinema these elements are delicately weaved to produce visual metaphors that transmit the emotions and feelings of incipient love hence the directors oscar prize comes without surprise on the other hand despite it being a musical the songs did not inspire me and were secondary to the visual effects and plotthe beginning of the movie was dull an actress trying to find her hollywood light is clich and overdone however the onset of the love story changed everything the eventful plot reminds us of the fragility of love its dependence on serendipity and the importance of communication the ending which comprises a full twenty minutes is gloriousoverall the movie is good i would not watch it again but i would recommend watching it,happy
is 2016 american musical romantic comedydrama film written and directed by damien chazelle its chazelles most successful movie what has won all seven of its golden globe nominations and has made chazelle the youngest person to win both the oscar for best director and the golden globe for best director in starring roles are ryan gosling as a jazz pianist sebastian and emma stone as an springing actress mia the location of the film is in los angeles where the whole story unfolds mia is a barista who dreams of becoming an actress but uselessly sebastian is a struggling jazz pianist earning money as a restaurant pianist but his boss fired him he dreams to open his authentic jazzbar they met in in a party where sebastian plays in a thirdrate 1980s pop cover band after the two walk to their cars where the following story starts they started to meet and fell in love soon they will approach their goals mia directed her onewoman play and sebastian became a member of a successful jazz fusion band but they werent happymias play wasnt successful and even sebastians band was at the top he knew he doesnt enjoy this music after many arguments they grew apart and went on their lives separately but five years later they both have achieved their goalsmia is a famous actress and sebastian owns his jazzbar even if the movie seems at first like a lighthearted musical its actually thoughtprovoking and has a good moral because its a big budget film it has a great camera work and is aesthetically good to watch the only weakness is that the movie is a bit predictable already at the beginning i knew how the story is going to move in general was this the best musical film ive ever seen whith the twist of the story and a good moral it was interesting and gripping to see it,happy
never been much of a reviewer but this film is an exception this one is a must watch took my breath away from the very start till the end this film has everything a perfect picture needs to have it was amazing and beautiful cannot say that enough loved every moment of this film,happy
the moral of the story is you cant have your cake and itif you are a jerk no wonder this film was so popular in hollywood where so many jerks abound who can feel reassured that their messed up lives are fate not because of their own idiocy yes you can have the love of your life and pursue the passion of your lifeif youre not a jerk about it and have contrived egoladen dinner conversations that you storm away from with the emotion maturity of a 12 year old the very first sequence sets the two protagonists up as couple of self absorbed jerks and the final sequence pivots on what could have been if sebastian hadnt been a jerk from the outsetbut other than that the film had all the hesitant dance steps plot transparency wooden acting except emma stone offkey singing and simplistic 2 chord tune drilled into the ground of a college amateur production,happy
we rated this film 1010is full of emotion happy and sad met with beautiful scenes jazzy musical numbers and bright coloursabsolutely loved the relationship between mia and sebastianthe music in the film will melt your heart and if it doesnt captivate you the first time it will get you the next timei was extremely moved and disappointed by the ending of the film and the fates of the main characters as much as i was happy that mia and sebastian achieved their dreams in the end the fact that it was technically an unhappy ending breaks my heart every time i watch it,happy
when i wanted to see in a movie theater i found no company to go with and i let it pass i asked my friends and they answered its pretty but not like the musicals of the past then it won 261 awards and 193 nominations according to imdbcom and i stopped asking i finally saw it two days ago and i understood them yes by parts its pretty but the problem in my opinion is that it tries to be like old musicals and that format changed evolved because the world changed and the perception and appreciation of art advanced and because shows became more eclectic and media stuff as illustrated by that 2001 spawn called moulin rouge the naive and perhaps a bit silly world of top hat meet me in st louis and finians rainbow no longer exists and people care very little for products as west side story or the sound of music that solved their sociological economic and ideological issues with someone singing somewhere or climb evry mountaini felt it since the film began when car drivers stuck in a traffic jam and under a hot sun sing a little song that in the harsh reality would translate into insults curses and maybe blows however i followed the game and began to like it the more so when the plot antagonized two realities two personalities with two very different goals ryan gosling plays the pianist sebastian a musician who is trying to rescue forms of cultural expression from oblivion or extinction anguished because jazz is dying and he does not have a space of his own to practice it and spread it emma stone is mia a girl who is after that old aspiration of actors since the early 20th century who lined up to enter the factory of dreams or nightmares you name it that is the cinema of los angeles  which is not the same as the cinema of new york or texasimmediately my identification was with sebastian although as a theater person i understood mia however it did not take too long before the character disappointed me mia has no assistance to stage her show and only gives one performance of her monologue because the opening night was not what she expected and returns home i have seen openings with fewer people than those who went to see her in addition to make matters worse in one of the most unlikely dramatic and ridiculous turns of the plot some producers propose her to make a film about her ideas of course this may happen no one denies it but directorscreenwriter damien chazelle does not let us see what she did on stage so we can say sure such a good actress deserves that opportunity but no we must imagine that the monologue was great although truthfully at that point of the movie mia has not shown any trait of geniusto be fair sebastian does not either but his character has conviction strength and determination and he has his great commercial moment before mias when he plays with a standard band a bad song in front of an entranced crowd shouting and dancing to the tune luckily the pianist reacts and says no this is not my thing count the awards that emma stone won and those ryan gosling got and you will know this world goes only wants the voice and american idol all in all i admit that mias option is valid there are many people who want to be the art world and have families to the effect the presence of tom everett scott a nice actor who plays her husband helps a lot but chazelle and stone and gosling in their performances insinuate sadness and regret for what could have been but was not as each followed their dreamsin short this central conflict between art and personal fulfillment is adorned with musical numbers tinged with romanticism that work very well those that my friends call pretty or are very cheesy like the dance by the stars in the observatory griffith and overloaded with special effects i guess many miss the expertise of gene kelly ginger rogers and fred astaire when dancing or the voices of julie andrews and mary martin but the earth trembles and the hurricane is coming so nobody has time for the lalala of this romantic comfit,happy
this film rips off from multiple films without ever getting remake rights umbrellas of cherbourg young girls of rochefort moulin rouge an american in paris singin in the rain tophat funny faces and many more this is an atrocious work that i do not even consider art ill admit it is entertaining and a decent copycat but a copycat can never ever receive full credit it instantly gets a 010 for being a dishonest and slimy piece of work the plot goes like this it is broken into four stages of time just like umbrellas of cherbourg the girl and guy gets together they go on dates they end up having a conflict that separates them and in the end they break apart it goes over a two year time span to many years later where they meet again it ends with a bitter sweet ending just like umbrellas of cherbourg mia gets pregnant like genevieve its act to act all structured a complete copycat of umbrellas of cherbourg this would be okay if chazelle bought the rights but there is no proof that he did its an embarrassing attempt at remaking with mediocre everything even i hated the smooth and standard cinematography it rips off the visuals from umbrellas of cherbourg the worst thing is it rips off from 5 other films and then tries to paint it self as an original musical on the market such a shady director he should be sued and imprisoned i am boycotting anything chazelle makes an undeserving nontalented director who is incapable of being creativea fat 010,happy
i wonder if i had just stumbled upon this movie being damien chazelles third as director not knowing anything or knowing little about it if i wouldve likedlovedfallen head over heels for it more than i did because of the state of the independent film scene and this is one of those midway movies like pulp fiction where it has its toes in indie and mainstream hollywood the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting movies like come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for say a star wars movie it also has to do too with the directors previous whiplash being a ride that gives emotional rollercoaster its clichd status since it was the announcement of a director from my generationexact age group swinging for the fences and with its major reviews and festival runs seemed like another one and it is ultimately a great movie could it have been better hmmsometimes furthermore coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always correct as one might say it may take another viewing or a few days to get more of what i felt about it but i can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies and usually these cross and twist like its a dance out in outer space chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar  artists in music and performance close enough as the same thing who meet have a little pushandpull at first they first meet by the usual serendipity of la traffic jam  that it could be criticized as a rehash hell we just had a movie come out a month agoaround this same time nocturnal animals that if you look closely isnt too far off though the endings are very different which ill get to what is so gobsmackingly joyful about this moviegosling and stone first were paired five years ago in crazy stupid love and im sure chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around though as a nitpick and it should be mentioned gosling cant sing anything exceptional stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities of pulling off all of the carefree movie ideas that chazelle has seriously hes about as geeky in his homage as tarantino  notice the ingrid bergman wall sized poster in mias place and other parts or the whole use of the wb lot but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately more than well they find the truth in the clichs that come with artiststryingtomakeit and sell it as well as chazelles script can get them towhich perhaps is the one thing that keeps me from saying omg this is the greatest movie ive ever seen in my life which again hype  it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in la traffic that its jarring to then go back into the real world more or less songs of course happen but its a balancing act and all the while chazelles story points for these two is so familiar as far as the what happens when you follow your dreams in artisticcorporate america thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain  not embracing and finding a truth in clich but just being conventional ie how gosling becomes a piano player in a group john legends got and this takes him away from his actual dream of a jazz club and then stones mias dream of being an actress etc etc so forth and so on and then the final 15 minutes or so happens where we flash ahead five years to whats happened with these two people who at one point went to the same planetarium as in rebel without a cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy im reminded of the french new wave a lot by the way in how much chazelle embraces postmodern selfconsciousness if breathless was his whiplash is this his uh a woman is a woman and the two of them have changed more or less and gosling plays a song that transports into the what if and its i dont have words for it its what the movies are about its a magical wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why i can stand being around people whispering like i dont hear you old bastards and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely madeup empathetic landscapemy first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls of saying this is better than this that is whiplash vs but it doesnt matter that last fifteen minutes and many other scenes and stones performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography oh man i dont care if youre verging from homage into ripoff of pt anderson its so delicious for my eyes to look at confirms that chazelle is the real deal a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the dream of artists and musicians and actors and so on and at the same time can bring it forward with soul it takes a little time but my instinct is to call this a soulful hollywood movie first beautiful homage second,happy
is this the film some misguidedpeople have raved about i am 15 minutes into it and absolutely hate it now i love musical movies and treasure the likes of west side story my fair lady even the rocky horror picture show but seems to miss on every point the musical numbers are irrelevant as well as being awful and unmemorable the opening sequence is as far removed from a tasty introduction to the genre as it is possible to be i find it hard to believe that anyone could have enjoyed this crap the characters are uninteresting and i am unable to care what happens to themi cannot see myself making it much further because i am never going to get that wasted time back the one plus i can give it is the colour and lighting but that is all it has to offer,happy
anyone looking for rogers  astaire gene kelleycyd charisse get ready to skip this and stick with the standards otherwise i cant not love this throughout colors blazing la coming into focusand being celebrated the appeal of these two stars acting together andor solo speaks for itself bursting into song at will yeah thats not life duh but it is what keeps any good musical alive neither of the stars are a singers but their voices still shine and keep me wanting moreemma stone is brilliant i cant compliment her enough without getting sappy i went w a friend who had teenage nephews and nieces to a matine they were prepared to hate every minute of this experience no guts and blood superheroes but they recognized emma from a spiderman role after the catchy opening these young sophisticates watched in awe and left humming smiles on all maybe even the right impressionon young mediasaturated mindsi own it now not quite the experience on a small screen still by far in my top 3 movies for 2016 and maybe my top 10 of all time,happy
growing up i hated musicals i admit do was never mu genrelater as a teen we had awful programmes like fame with blokes prancing around in legwarmers haha this kinda reminds me of that in some ways cringeworthyaltho i also get tired of war movies explosions and car chases i was hoping for a nuclear catastrophe soon after the opening scenesick buckets required if you are forced to sit through this with the more feminine half of the relationship,happy
i think people expect too much of this film thanks to the slew of oscars it has won i see it as a wellmade and expertlyshot musical with great songs and many many references to films of a prior age emma stone is a much better singer than ryan gosling and his dancing is somewhat stiff but they are actors not professional musicians  i wasnt expecting perfection from the man or a fred astaire impersonation and to his credit he nails the piano not so easy  i know from experience if you want a good and very colourful film with excellent music and reasonable dancing this is it  if you want an ok film with some really excellent music and dancing watch chicago,happy
those who have seen the film will recognize my review title as the theme song i dont really know what to write about the film except that i fell in love with it after about half an hour and i cant put my finger on why and not being able to set your finger on it may just be a quality that surpasses so many other more verbalizable qualities well the acting was top notch the story touching and sweet in the best possible sense the dialogue funny the musical numbers did not seem out of place as one might have feared and if gosling doesnt have the greatest singing voice ever he has the ability to make it work to perfection anyway sort of like the young james stewart when he soldiered through cole porters easy to love as for the ending  well i cried i dont mind admitting it or yes i do but i admit it anyway and im an old and unsentimental guy not unlike dickens ebenezer scrooge but i did shed a tear it was when that lalalalalalala started again near the end as one might have expected it would and on came the waterworks its funny how movies can make us completely sentimental about things we get so quickly over in real life,happy
is an american movie from 2016 and little needs to be said about the cast and production here it runs for slightly over 2 hours and is the most recent work by writer and director damien chazelle the two leads are emma stone and ryan gosling chazelle won an oscar for his direction while stone took home glory for her performance the movie itself probably lost as close as you could imagine in the best picture category now about the film many people say that this movie is the return of old hollywood musicals and this is partially true while the film is set in the 21st century the music costumes and the entire atmosphere have something that feels extremely retro all the time lets start with the music it won oscar for song and score and it is probably deserving the two oscarnominated songs in the right context the winner as a duet work wonderfully and are among the parts that can be considered heart and soul of the film but the real heart and soul here is emma stones performance she has excellent material to work with and still manages to elevate it on so many occasions i believe that she was the perfect choice for the character here in the lighter as well as heavier moments and honestly there were certainly more of a latter this is much more a drama than a comedy as for gosling i am not so impressed first of all it needs to be said that he did not have the material as good as stones we find out nothing or not much about his background really about his family life about his past and its clear from start to finish that he will always play second fiddle to his colead i may be a bit biased as i was never big on gosling but in terms of acting and face expressions i am not impressed by him in here either he may not have great material to work with but he also does not elevate it and ultimately one thing that this film may have needed for making an even bigger impact would have been a better male lead its pretty ridiculous they gave him a golden globe for thatnow on a more positive note hurwitz music was good for the most part i already talked about the two most important songs but i also liked the very first song of the film maybe because i just like choirlike ensemble performances as for the film itself chazelle did a pretty good job overall especially if you take his age into consideration its a really impressive feat for somebody around the age of 30 the way he includes parallels is as smart as simple it is effective nonetheless though and thats all that counts one example would be the two scenes of a star entering the bar another would be the honking references another would be the what if sequence at the end another would be the elaboration on one partner sacrificing his dreams for the other the one when mia is supposed to follow her boyfriend who is really successful with his band the other would be again the what if sequence at the end and there are many more moments like this you will recognize them if you see them i also think this was a much more beautiful film visually than i expected it to be no surprise and not undeserving that it won an oscar for the cinematographylastly let me give you a parallel too namely between this film and whiplash chazelles previous successful oscarwinning work i am not talking about the brief inclusion of jk simmons here or about the fact that chazelle is apparently right now the very best filmmaker on the planet when it comes to musicthemed movies i want to talk about love the way he depicts it in both films namely as a wonderful state that however becomes very fragile in the face of career development and a status that even needs to be sacrificed for individual happiness makes me wonder if i would categorize this movie as romance sure there is lines that somewhat make up for it like when they say they will always love each other but overall its a pretty sober state of things when you see it in the grand scheme here and in whiplash rightwrong place rightwrong time ie coincidence play a major role here and the message that you should never let your romantic feeling limit you in anyway is absolute core for chazelle apparently and happiness is still happening eventually and there are no hard feelings as we learn from the final smile that may have ended their relationship once and for all and they will probably never see each other again afterward and one final note on why i believe that so many people relate to this movie and this is one that has nothing to do with the subject of music at all stones character could have been in any profession as we see a character fighting hard for her professional success and we all can relate to her and her struggles because even in completely different professions we probably had been in exactly the same situation at some point now for a very last comment let me ask you the question what you were thinking after mias oneperson performance did you think her career was over after the mean comments then this tells you a lesson to care less what people think about you or whatever and let only your own opinion be the determining factor now your persuasion should be to watch as it is without a doubt one of the better films of 2016 and maybe even the best music film in recent time even iif i personally would not rank it anywhere near the vastly superior whiplash or les misrables,happy
this is another movie that shows that just because critics and the academy call a movie amazing and one of the best picture of the yeardoesnt mean the movie is actually worth paying money for or sitting throughits about a struggling actress who cant seem to get a gig and a struggling jazz musician who eventually gets a gig but mia doesnt approve because its sebastian giving up his jazz dream or some stupid nonsense like that he accuses her of only liking him when he was unsuccessful and they go their separate ways for whatever reason she gets a casting call and he has to go beg her to come back to do the audition cue lame musical scene 89 thats an exaggeration and he pats himself on the back for getting her a gig and they declare they will always love each other but dont get back togethercue a five years later time jump and shes married with a kid and finds he started his jazz club cue lame dream sequence where they imagine what life would be like had it worked out between them and movie endsthis movie was so so so bad i like emma stone and ive never had any issue with ryan gosling but this movie was just terrible why is it so acclaimed its just a romance musical im glad i didnt pay for the ticket i got invited to see it by a friend and she offered to pay because she didnt want to go by herself boy am i glad my money didnt go towards the box office receipts of this stink fest id feel personally offended if it didthere are too many people out there who base what they think of a movie based on what the critics say or what awards they get nominated for but frankly those people need to start thinking for themselves because just because a movie is highly rated doesnt mean its good it just means that critics are pretentious and they think it makes them look cultured if they enjoy a musical like thissave yourself the time and energy,happy
this is a love story with rocks in the road worse than bumps these are boulders the two leads are interesting and you want them to succeed i did not realize it was a musical but there is lots of music in this one apparently completely performed by the leadsit is somewhat like chorus line not the movie the broadway version it has a lot of heart the story is rather standard but also nonstandard at the same time you think you know where it is going but then they make a left turn or even a uturni liked this movie be sure to pop the popcorn to give yourself lots to do because at 90 minutes it feels like about 3 hours interesting but intimate very much a character study of two performers with different talents and directions who came together for a few years i dont know where it will end still about 30 minutes from the end and still more turns comingwould be an 8 if they had trimmed about 40 minutes out of it really drags thank goodness the characters are likable or next stop would have been the stop button,happy
hi im just wondering why here the rating of the movie is very good  86 by more than 120k people and obviously not so many people liked the movie itself or parts of it also ive read independent comments not payed articles of people from my country and from usa who wont rate it more than 5610just statistically if we have 40 negative or neutral comments or reviews and 60 so great movie it should be something near for the ratingwhat do you thinkbest sofia,happy
unhappy is a person who never dared to dream this world and our mind have the endless opportunities and we have to be really miserable to even try to suppress those opportunities because without our perfectional ideas and notions of life and how we should live it we become empty bodies and let physiology do its thing only when you dare to dream you let yourself flow in a world of pure imagination and possibilities you create your individuality and slightly optimistic and romantic perception of life which helps you get through the tough times and standard routines of daily life having the hope that someday you can achieve whatever you have pictured in your head gives you wings and positives to go on and this ones for dreamers out there who dared to dream and achieved something in their life for those who are on their way to do so and for those who are too scared to try yes it may go in a completely different direction but you will never know until you try sometimes life has better things to offer than we can imagine and it may lead to something wonderful and new lumiere brothers had only visions in their heads and ambitions when they invented film as we know it now being inspired by thomas edison and others would they have done it if they never chased the dream you know the answer the answer is a trip to the moon city lights casablanca space odyssey the godfather schindlers list lord of the rings and the latter one is a perfect addition to the history of cinema absolutely deserving of all the praise it receives would i change anything in it not a single word or move from the astonishing play of colors and tones to the hopeful and sparkling eyes of the characters were captured wonderfully by one of the bravest and inspiring dreamers of modern hollywood  damien chazelle dreaming is simple he made it clear to himself and to the audience with this movie no tricky turns and twists in the story line no complicated dialogues everything is clear to the point that it lets you just enjoy the whole spectacle with a bit of nostalgia of your own forgotten dreams of where you are right now in your life and where are you heading to all of this is spiced up with magical hidden character called music from city of stars to the last note of mia  sebastians theme the soundtrack is wonderful it is cheerful it is sad it is hopeful and simply mesmerizing undoubtedly the best film in recent years deserving of all the golden statues including the main one for best picture proving that the best movie of the year can be about a simple subject and not about a slumdog boy who becomes millionaire or a king struggling with his speech or american heroes saving lives in iran or elsewhere this movie is relatable to everyone although dreamers orers are considered to be out of this world and not aware of what is happening we are all still foolishly with a bit of hope and enthusiasm trying to chase our dreams and create our own world of reality so heres to the one who dream,happy
a major disappointment considering all the hype and golden globes damiens script failed to deliver showing that most new artists dont have the chops looks like the previous generation didnt get the apprenticeship they needed so the great ideas and tricks of the trade could be passed on native talent doesnt get the job done there is a reason everyone must pay their dues i hope he doesnt buy the fake news and awards because those people havent seen a real musical and failed to realize what was missingsee it if you want but i bet you will not leave humming the tunes or remember how bad the opening number was at least 25 of the dancers were out of sync,happy
okay lets start from the beginning of the moviefrom the beginning its already obvious what kind of movie that were going to geta bunch of people dancing in the middle of traffic with colorful outfits theyre singing a song from the soundtrack called another day of sun which i would like you guys to check it out this opening really sets the tone of the movie a very colorful and hopeful movie i was shocked by how bright this movie is because im so used to movies thats dark and grittythe opening sequence of this movie was filmed in a way so it seems like it was filmed in one take which in my opinion is just amazing i dont know how they did it but it works and it looks awesome the song combined with a great choreography and swift camera movement this combination is what makes so goodnot just that the performances are also really good ryan gosling emma stone all did a terrific job in this movie particularly emma stone the entire movie works because of her i think she did most of the jobs she sings dancing acting and does a lot of stuff thats just amazing i mean ryan gosling did bits too but youll know why i think emma stone is the one who gave the best performance in this movie once you saw the movie yourselfalso use colors in a very interesting way as i said before this movie is very colorful although not as strong as nicolas winding refns usage of colors this movie also use color to elevate the emotion of a scene the most prominent color in this movie is purple i dont know why but it works so well youll see purple everywherealso the lighting works oh my god it reminds me to a lot of movies from back in the day fair to say this movie has one of the best visual works of the year as someone who have jazz as his own name i cant appreciate this movie more if youre a big fan of music jazz youll have a blast jazz is basically one of the strongest aspect of this movie throughout the entirety of the movie i always think of my dad hell love this movie so much ryan goslings character is in someway represent my dad he is so passionate about jazz and hes sad cause no one can relate to him which brings us to the next point and the most important aspect of the moviewhat is this movie about lots of people are saying that this movie is a love letter to la or even an homage to the golden age of hollywood while its not wrong either la looks amazing in this movie the way its shot it looks great and its obvious as well that damian chazelle is trying to pay homage to the golden era by how this movie begins and endedbut at its core this movie is about passionate people about the one who dreams about how it doesnt matter how foolish you seem you should go out there and go for your dream go for anything you want in life and its also about the sacrifices that we have to make along the way that even though we might get what we want in life we still not going to get everything theres a price to everythingand all of that told in a very beautiful touching and heartbreaking way much like life itselfwhich is why im also going to talk about the ending dont worry its not a spoiler i was worried with how this movie is going to end cause i dont really want a clichd ending just to keep the goodfeeling but no guys the ending is amazing its not clich at all its amazing youll loved itthe ending was pretty much the same like the opening but more beautiful and unique by same i mean done with dancing and musicand as a dreamer whos at times is an absolute fool i am in love with this movie and youll probably think im biased but if i say the otherwise then ill be lying i love this movie and this movie is definitely going to be a movie that ill watch again and again until im dying great great film,happy
if you are a big musical fan or not this is a gorgeous and must see film i myself am a huge musical fan and enjoyed it a lotsurprisingly i didt plan on seeing it but thought i should give it a go and im so glad i did here is why i loved it so much  and may have already preordered it on itunes 1beautiful storyline the screenplay to this amazing movie was so well put together and had little iconic moments throughout the story i also liked that it wasnt rushed and it took its time to get through all the important parts of the movie who ever wrote the screenplay i applaud you 2 amazing acting emma stone and ryan gosling have great chemistry together throughout the movie together and apart they were so in character the entire time and have really deserved the awards they won at the golden globes their acting really brought the movie to life and i think they were meant for their roles3 incredible music being a musician myself i enjoyed all the music in the movie it was so nice to listen to beautiful jazz through the movie and be transported to music where jazz was so popular it was so great to listen to this music instead of the poprap we hear on the radio today if i had to listen to just the music i would be fine well i hope ive convinced you to go and watch this fabulous movie you wont regret it,happy
charming magnificent greatthis was a pure  magical cinematic experience i love musical movies and i was waiting for this movie since i heard about it wow it exceeded my expectationsryan gosling  emma stone were perfect now we can easily say that damien chazelle became one of the important directors working today everything was stunning in this movie the songs and the music were amazing the dance sequences were done brilliantly the cinematography the editing and the production design were excellent a lot of people said that looks like a dream yes it is a dream a dream that has a lot of charming moments but also has sad moments if you have big dreams or passion about something you will find this movie inspiring to let you follow your dreams and passionsis one of the biggest surprises in 2016 i was really happy with every second in it i enjoyed it on so many levels and again since i am a big fan of musical movies it gave me full satisfaction,happy

follows mia an aspiring actress and sebastian an aspiring jazz pianist who meet and fall in love upon my first viewing i really didnt care for this movie the music made it stand out but that was about it on my second watch i found that while it could be tedious it was a very wellmade film lets start with the obvious which would be the music its fantastic every single number is memorable and a pleasure to listen to well after seeing the film this effect does die a little after the second viewing but perhaps that was due to the fact that i saw it mere weeks after my first watch and everything was still fresh in my mind regardless theres no getting around the fact that the score is great but more than that it flows into the movie really well no track feels forced into the movie for the sake of slapping a musical genre sticker onto it it takes time to both allow the music to play then the audience to get into it the music always fits the movie well too so none of it really feels unnatural save for maybe one track towards the end the acting is very good and while i definitely dont think these are the best performances either actor has pulled off they were very impressive regardless both gosling and stone get into their roles so much that they feel authentic and moreover seem like they could actually be lovers in real life or at least really good friends the performances are a great compliment to the writing which is also fantastic the conversations are authentic and i could legitimately see myself speaking in a similar way just probably not about jazz and sure the movie follows the typical romantic movie formula but most every aspect of that formula is handled in an almost seamless way it takes its time to build up the two leads relationship at the beginning so that it doesnt feel rushed and the end is handled in a very realistic and engaging way the directing here is most always stellar the movie opens with what appears to be one long take of an entire musical number and probably the best in the whole movie while that singletake gimmick was easily faked it still goes on for quite some time in between the obvious cuts there is one scene in particular aside from the opening in goslings characters house that is spectacular sure it could have easily been cheated but it looks great regardless theres a style to it and its clear that whoever chose that shooting style knew what they were doing despite all the glamour and masterful filmmaking on display this is not a film without flaws while it does follow and improve upon the romantic formula it still has trouble putting the love into the leads relationship the turning point is mostly understandable but little things about it make it harder to accept as reality other little things here and there bothered me but that was the biggest of those gripes my biggest problem however was with the second act when the two leads finally start dating it divulges to the hollywood clich of showing a montage of the two lovers running around together instead of actually developing their relationship if there was even a little of that in the in between portion to build a bit of early relationship them i think id have liked it enough to put up its rating it made a jump that just didnt flow and i had trouble looking past it overall is nearly amazing the performances are while not necessarily oscarworthy pretty darn close the music is outstanding the directing is usually amazing the writing is authentic and just about everything else is great too however it suffers in its second act and a few other little places here and there in the end i would recommend this movie,happy
before i had never seen any films in theaters with such toetapping emotions truly so lucky that i was among the first audiences in the world viewing this alltime mustsee film while most of chinas movie lovers are thrilling but not being able to see it after my second view of at arclight cinerama dome damien chazelle and emma stone came for the qa it was so unbelievable to me that i could see them in person in 2016 i had a most difficult time throughout the year probably of all my life many times could get me to abandon the dreams that id been chased so far like what says in the opening song another day of sun there are so many insane things in the life that could let you down spoiling your dreams yes i could always feel discouraged depressed and being untrusted and underestimated thats what let you down this film saved me as it says behind these hills im reaching for the heights and chasing all the lights that shine and when they let you down youll get up off the ground as the morning tools around and its another day of sun i spent a week in la after my phd congregation as la is the holy land to all dreamers as well as filmmakers and film lovers many of the time was spent in la theaters two weeks before this la trip i got an offer from a very top lab in a very top us university although i strived incredibly hard and spent unexpectedly long time for reaching it behind these hills im reaching for the heights even though i feel a very sharp distance between the people there and me however as i always say nothing worthy is easy before the success being reached everyone is just struggling on the road for a somewhere thats just waiting to be found before that point what we should do is do what you need to do till they discover you and make you more than youre seeing nowundoubtedly reignites a fire deep in my heart that has been almost diminished i see this trip and this experience of watching as dreamreigniting it has a very important place in my career path im more than eager to seeing shining and becoming the best picture in the 2017 academy awards ceremony,happy
i cannot remember a movie where i cared less about the characters or disliked the music so much as everyone else who hated this film has said hats off to the marketing pukes who pulled this little coup off the rocky horror picture show is more sparkling and scintillating,happy
while this movie has won many awards i can not see why the story line is decent but jumpy the ending is a disaster and the acting is a little over done to call this a musical is close but not quite songs were not catchy or necessary at times i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldnt come to like it had to pause every 30 minutes or so to walk away because it dragged in many parts,happy
i absolutely loved this movie it related to my life in a lot of ways the acting was great im so glad they made a movie that connected with the audience in different ways especially aspiring actors i loved the way they shot the movie as well it was really cool i hope they make more films like this,happy
the movie is a masterpiece a true inspiration for all dreamers and art lovers some scenes had me really feeling like i am in heaven the music is heavenly specially mia  sebastians theme and city of stars emmas performance is simply perfection ryans was also good and i loved sebastian as for the ending i am not happy at all with it it left me very disappointed it could have been less harsh overall i am in love with this movie i can watch it all day long and everyday,happy
i wasnt planning on watching this moviebut i wasnt disappointedlike at all it s just funbeautiful musicjazzstarsbright moonhumorcolorscolors and more colorskind of a walk in the clouds experienceso unique and perfect and let s just say emma and ryan were thee perfect couple to star on such an amazing work of artit was just the right proportion of chemistry needed on screen ryan is a living perfect doll with great charisma and emma well she sure as hell deserved that oscar the movie is all about dream and huge doses of positive attitudes if you re so busy buried under piles of files at the office and that you re so overwhelmed with your job routinejust go on watch thisi promise you a ride you won t forget,happy
produced excellently definitely one of the best of the year its a cute movie and might lack a depth youd expect from a movie that won 6 oscars just by the sheer weight that adds to any production but it doesnt disappoint cudos to stella artois for their covert product placement its as subtle as product placement should be nowadays  theres no more space for marlboro and john wayne the ending couldve been scene tore me apart im still finding out if i liked it or not  it is both romantically childish that the love between the two had to be shown and could not be left to you own imagination but at the same time entirely fitting to the whole movie proposal i like to believe a good movie is capable of in between its own story adding something you enjoy to your hall of admirations as this movie does with jazz i cant believe imdb only has full number stars as this is definitely somewhere between a 8 and a 9 when i for the year its a 9 but when i think for the long haul it tends back to an 8 lets just have it at 85 and leave it at that,happy
i love magic and thats what i felt when i watch enchanted there are a lot of complaints about this film i assume mostly due to the never ending positive buzz its gotten there was even an snl skit about how widely and overly loved it is but i cant help it i love emma stone and ryan gosling i love a musical and i love the classic style you can tell me all day long about how stone is breathy gosling looks at his feet when he dances i dont care i liked the way it made me feel and i left humming under my breath and dancing up the stairs i went into the theater for my first viewing in the throes of an existential crisis which come around every other week i was immediately invested in the characters and cried for a majority of the second half a few weeks later i went in for another show time because i was worried i wasnt in a stable mental state the first time around i cried slightly less in my second showing but it still felt as connected flat out it was a beautifully shot exciting catchy frolic through every young dreamers fantasy in la 9810,happy
is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen it has been a long time since we have a good musicaldrama movie until ryan gosling  emma stone were phenomenal in the movie their chemistry was incredible on screen likewise their dancing acting and singing were amazing as well they portrayed their characters perfectly  told a beautiful story on screen damien chazelle is a brilliant young director and i can see him being a successful director in the future everything about is beautiful magical marvelous and magnificent i was fully immersed and captivated throughout the movie the soundtrack  the final scene are just flawless  unforgettable i cried many times throughout the movie every single detail in the movie contains a deep meaning gives me so many emotions from joy to sadness it inspires me to follow my true passion  chase after my dream when i watched this movie in theater it was like a dream which i didnt want it to end is a masterpiece  it is one of the movies that will always stay with me im very happy  grateful that i have seen it is a true display of real art thank you damien  lionsgate for making this movie,happy
its true weve seen films like before in the first five minutes it becomes all too clear that damien chazelles hollywood musical is trying to pay homage to all of the ones that came before it singin in the rain an american in paris etc however it is exactly this that makes such a delight for audiences and film critics alike and it heavily contributes to what could have so nearly been a bland and soulless filmryan gosling and emma stone are perfectly charming in the lead roles they share great chemistry and play well off of one another i was not a big fan of either star before watching this film watching i get the distinct feeling that these two were made to star in this film i cant picture anyone else playing mia or sebastian more perfectly however despite the love story that takes the fore front of the plot this film refuses to give us the happy ending weve grown so accustomed to receiving what a shame that one of the films freshest elements is also its saddest its also worth noting that earned the academy award for best cinematography an honour that was well deserved the camera is just as much an esteemed guest in the film as the lead stars it moves graciously with the actors and enhances the fluidity of the sequences beautiful lavender sunsets a gorgeous planetarium full of starlight and colours that dance and sparkle in the street lights all come to life in this amazing vibrant storyi loved and i am not ashamed of it its not a new story by any means but it is criminally fun and oh so very hard not to become swept up in its astounding melodies the criticism for it is understandable but we should never be made to feel guilty for the films we enjoy so if your feet start tapping to another day of sun or city of stars then by all means enjoy it to your hearts content film is art art is subjective never stop falling in love with what makes your soul sing and your heart raceas a musical succeeds in a land slide but do not forget that this is also a film about winning losing love heartache and most importantlya film about dreams and those who are brave and foolish enough chase them,happy
when onceinalifetime love conflicts with lifetime dreams one or both have to give or so the characters believe the result rips open hearts and the timespace continuum robert frost wrote i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence sings and dances that sigh in high definitionif youve ever felt the need to sacrifice one passion for another and you have a heart this film will leave you in tears it did me if not it wont make senseif squashy squirrelly fudgy paintings show you reality with chisel preciseness this film will be a life altering ride if the impreciseness of oil on canvass annoys you and you wonder whats the point of brushes when pixels do so well itll be a waste of time and money to watchif you tolerate are fascinated by or even love paradox and recognize that life is not like hollywood but it is like hollywood and that dissonance is built into the dna of the universe youll love this film if your yardstick comes from textbooks that preach 3act structure parabolic character arcs and tidy hollywood endings this film will annoy the hell out of youthis dreamlike film about dreaming worked for me it may or may not work for you,happy
saw on valentines day with my wife didnt know what to expect was thinking chick flick i was totally surprised thats one word i was expecting a boring slow beginning and it immediately started off with the freeway overpass song and dance scene it surprised me heres another word it engaged me think wow dont know what the bad reviews are all about maybe a lot of unhappy people out there maybe im a hick though i drive through la on occasion i for one havent been to a movie that impressed me as much as this one in many many years it wasnt a war movie an action movie horror spy suspense boring drama etc it is an unexpected movie heres another word genuine i have to admit the singing wasnt super strong but it was on key sincere and genuine the dancing wasnt the most complex but the timing was awesome very emotional and it flowed perfectly with the story beautiful timing gosling and stone were so genuine that i was intrigued and engaged even through he slow parts of the movie because of the good character development emma stone isnt the most beautiful actress but there is something so real and fresh about her performance theres just a hint or maybe more of a hint of awkwardness she just nailed it though imho right on the edge but nothing embarrassing just engaging gosling is great too but hey im a guy he does obviously play the piano pretty well too they had real musicians in this film as well like john legend for one and the reoccurring theme song was good the segues werent perfect and the ending was a little incongruent but with the time allotted they had to end it and bring you back down to earth somehow im a skeptic and not easily impressed but this film impressed me i love that they started out not liking each other but then bonded with the song and dance routines havent had a film impress me like this in years,happy
i saw it thrice in theaters but whiplash director damien chazelles with good reason left me totally flabbergasted when i left the cinema all three times i didnt get to watch it last year but no matter when i watch a good movie like it i stick with my clear opinion it also caught my eye for the reception and cult following it gained among both critics and moviegoers alike so theres more than just a random decision but lets move onwhen the film acts out as a musical to entertain those of all ages the audience is easily gripped by all the super catchy songs within its powerful plot that make it seem like the new generation of 1950s musicals even for those who arent fans of musicals or mainly in my case romance the cinematography throughout most of the songs that help make the film live up to its title like ryan gosling and emma stone in an observatory since this is a love story while also being a musical at the same time after all give it some of that rewatchable factor since everybody loves good moments like a lovely dance between two charactersstones and goslings characters both have their own sides of the story that develop them well enough that will really grip you to them from stones character mias moments of auditioning for films throughout all of her parts to goslings sebastian playing pianos from building to building and playing the movies most common theme that is of him and mia during their relationship the characterization suits both the leads even if their the only ones that really get it and i say this because above actors emma watson and miles teller who wouldve been the lead characters original before stone and gosling and characters at times story and pacing are really more important when it all comes down to itthe soundtrack is a big step forward for the films climax with the one thats destined to receive an academy award which im hoping it will being city of stars or one other towards the end as its my favorite song of film but im not going to spoil that one here its one thing for the songs to be played out but considering the fact that again its a musical actors also need to dance out the situations in which the songs that play in them would my favorite genre of course would be rock n roll but the films trying to be as jazzy as possible  something of which suits musicals more than guitars and sometimes drums and being all rock n roll or techno or whatever really depends on the musicals theme in this case since is trying to be all classical like some blast to the past like the 50s and 60s its trying to be the soothing kind of situationchoreography is another thing as to helping all the memorable and at times soothe tunes that would make one feel good and even imagine different situations heshe would be in even if the films cast seems less interesting than the two leads with the exception of spoiler alert john legend and jk simmons an actor who previously starred chazelles first film two years beforehand what matters is the overall story and how brilliantly its songs implemented and how it paces itself out and according to chazelle and his ideal soundtrack and excellent plot has clearly drawn inspiration from other musicals like boogie nights and singin in the rain but thats not a bad thing as long as you can make a story thats equally as heartfelt and strong in its storytelling but not the exact same thing in every element of its plot as all of the musicals it was based offof course theres no denying that the film has heart to it as there are plenty of scenes where audiences will be cracking up enough to feel good about themselves and even choke up at times that theyll really feel for those moments that with reason would really melt the heart so by no means will you not be having your feelings of sadness and happiness throughout it as its okay to feel both feelings throughout any good filmwho seriously needs a couple of dc superhero flicks that are completely rushed and nonsensical or boring and uninteresting romance crap like an overrated academy awardwinning 1997 boat sinking love story and really no offense to those of you die hard loversfans of them when you simply have an endearing storyline that blends romance in perfectly with its wellconstructed narrative while also timing wonderfully catchy musical numbers without having its score stand above the rest of story itself along with strong performances from two beloved actorsactresses breathtaking and beautiful cinematography and gripping moments of a fantasized romance it makes me feel as though i have a cinematic crush on emma stone cause alongside ryan gosling shes just absofreakinlutely incrediblethose who like it will surely be won over but those who dont probably will just leave it and move on at the end of the day but considering all of the best things ive mentioned about it it all adds up to not only one of my favorite films of last year at this point i cant decide what my top favorite of 2016 is though but my favorite musical of all time,happy
the 1 star reviews are most likely kids this movie is fantastic and saying that ryan and emma cant sing is just incredibly stupid i myself am a music producer and i know when someone can sing or not and they are fantastic singers and dancers now you should go watch this movie cause it simply is amazing beautiful and entertaining i watched it cause i love music not for a story or a plot or a drama movie no i watched this cause it is a real musical so if youre not into that you shouldnt watch it but if you love music like i do i highly suggest you get a ticket to your nearest cinema right now and again i dont review movies often but when i see movies getting injustice cause of some stupid reviewer behind a keyboard then i retaliate,happy
as this is imdb i am amazed at not the negative reviews but the nature of the hostility expressed it is one thing of course not to appreciate a film but is it really necessary to be so vindictive as a film may be the antidote those of us who appreciate it can take consolation that the awards that came and more may be coming will give added pleasure to top what is already a feel good film experience to finish i would like to comment with reference to those reviews that go beyond the pale in bad day at black rock spencer tracy says and i paraphrase you are wrong not only are you wrong but you are wrong in a long loud voice,happy
its a first class artistic simple movie pure very talented directing music is awesome fantasizing is incredible the drama scenes perfect great story acting very good directing view and technical directing and overall very fantastic movie should be seenvery emotional motivational dramatic romantic and it says never ever give up on dreamsryan gosling did really good work and emma did a really good work too but when we come to damien chazelle we must raise the hat for that young talented man who can take you to another world with his writing and directing we all must learn from damien how artistic movies should be hes an art schoolits really a masterpiece every thing in it is done perfectly and correctlyfrom the best movies of all time really enjoyable best 2 hours in this year,happy
minor vague spoilers below chazelles not only succeeds at being an outright love letter to the golden age of hollywood and be able to convey the magic it had but also succeeds at being a grounded profound and genuine depiction of how we aspire for dreams the film shows another side of how we try to achieve success or how we essentially try to be the best in our craft and passion just like in his previous film whiplash 2014 but whats so special about this film is the fact that the dreams of the characters give way for their love to flourish but at the same time it inevitably sets them apartthe classical and nostalgic backdrop of the film compliments the dream like aesthetic and feel that drips in every scene from being presented in cinemascope to the the ingrid bergman wallpaper to the breathtakingly fitting colorful color palettes the musical numbers that make you wonder if this film truly is set in the 21st century and the dialogue that is reminiscent of the usual golden age superstars like james dean and humphrey bogart all in all this film breathes an atmosphere that truly makes it feel like we are dreaming along with the protagonists and it also makes you want to go back to the times where films werent bloated with excessive blockbusters or piffle cash grabs and instead bring in the uplifting or melancholy magic that they should truly present emma stone and ryan gosling bring in their best performances yet with a triple threatesque nature to their performances just like the legendary actors from the golden age of cinema as both of them truly knew how to sing dance and most of all act the simple nuances each character bring to screen even in the smallest detail of visual comedy which people rarely do nowadays or visual story telling in each scene that makes the audience learn so much about a certain character with just one look or change in their face this is real acting show and dont tell this is the same reason why we remember ingrid bergman and humphrey bogart so much from casablanca because they did not need to convey their love through oblivious dialogue but through one glance at each other and we know it tells countless stories we immediately know stones character mias aspirations as she glances at an actress and see a strong emotion present in her face she didnt need to say anything more or outright say this is my dream through some sort of monologue this is tremendously subtle and well done acting that we rarely see nowadays the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and stunning in each scene the locations are incredibly iconic and nostalgic and the back drop of los angeles especially at night gives the movie an unique feel that will definitely remind you of the golden agesthe story and plot is quite simple yet layered enough to be such a universal story that anyone can fully grasp or have some sort of relation to sure it tells a faithful love story to the usual tropes and stories we saw in the 40s or 50s but it tells it through the lens of so many specific and realistic aspects of life the use of jazz once again by chazelle just like in whiplash and of course acting as a profession helps layer the story to a more grounded level their dreams another way to view this film is to see how it may not have been entirely a love story after all sure there is no denying the chemistry and love brought by the two did exist but in the end it was a story about conflict and compromise and about how sometimes compromise is walking away from something for each persons benefit no matter how hard it is the film presents that love can be used as a tool to help you achieve your dreams and how even at the end if not everything ends up the way it is you acknowledge and find compromise in that arbitrary feeling and connection of love that helped you in the way in the film whiplash the protagonist had to leave his girlfriend because he thinks that love was a distraction to the goal he needed to achieve but in they explore how love can also help you reach the goals you want in life but in the end just like most things in life you cannot have everything and this is why this film is such an honest and inspiring depiction of people who want to aspire for somethingin the end wasnt just a love letter to the golden age of hollywood it was also a love letter to the fools who dream its a love letter to anyone who wants to find someone in the crowd who can lift them off the ground its a love letter to anyone who may have been discouraged or disheartened in achieving something its a love letter to anyone who feels like dancing and singing see themselves flying off with their dreamsverdict 9910,happy
a movie that broke the record and won 7 golden globes what makes this movie so special and worthy to all of these awardsthe music is a musical and despite im not really a fan of musicals and just by watching the first scene of the movie i thought the movie wasnt my taste but by the end of the film i couldnt stop humming the theme of this movie it sticks to your head in a beautiful way the music in this film is really perfect and the lyrics are very deep id say its the kind of music that no one can say no to youll be tapping your foot and clapping your hands with this beautiful soundtrackthe plot simple enough yet very complex and thoughtful the main idea of this film is dreams vs love and if you have a dream are you willing to sacrifice will you give up i found it very inspirational and almost everyone can relate to itthe acting ryan gosling and emma stone are just charming theyre the perfect couple in front of the screen the chemistry between them is wonderful and their romance is very realistic whether acting or dancing theyre just gorgeous to look atthe cinematography very well shot the colors really shine in the scenes full of joy and a bit dark when its sad it just matches the films mood and the angles of shooting are very precise the way they shot this film makes it very appealing to watchthe ending my favorite part of the film and without spoiling it i can tell you this movie will show you how reality works and how life can hit you where you least expected but in the end everything goes onall in all really impressed me and is definitely an instant classic it has everything a perfect movie needs go watch this movie immediately if you havent,happy
is a spectacular piece of cinema in fact i would go as far as to say that it is not a film but more of an emotional journey that both the characters and audience go throughthe acting and dance choreography is very impressive and has clearly taken along time to perfect but it is definitely time well spent as the finished product is dazzling to watch emma stone and ryan gosling have an excellent screen presence that really draws you in and makes you look that ever bit closer at every frame the cinematography of the movie is beautiful and the shots in the film are like paintings the vibrant colours and camera movement are everything thats good about the film industry that somehow went missing from watching the film it is clear that director damien chazelle had a strong vision that he and his cast and crew brought to life the music of is hypnotic and makes you feel nostalgic it is strange how it works its way into your mind i have a feeling that i will be humming along to the tune of for awhile the ending of the film is very refreshing and i am tremendously glad that the film ended in the way that it did i would highly recommend this film to anyone with a passion for cinema or who simply just loves to watch a good film on paper i could see how this film could be a gamble from the perspective of a producer but i am happy that the gamble was taken and i have no doubt the will go down as a classic overall i would give 8 out of 10 as it is one of the best films i have watched in a long time,happy
i saw last week after hearing the news that it won 7 golden globes the movie starts about an aspiring actress and a jazz musician falling in love with reality catching them the first half is the rosy phase of knowing and loving each other part whereas the second part is unexpectedly different with surprise ending the movie can have different interpretation to different people but is beautifully made musical score is great especially the initial dance sequencegreat acting by ryan and emma emma kills this one with so much expressive actingstrong contender for oscar musical category,happy
this movie is so good it will make you not want to see anything else for a while thats how strong the after taste is the music is beyond brilliant and so appropriate that it just flows effortlessly through the film making it even more delightful your gonna search every track everywhere on the internet and be disappointed with half baked covers my advise would be to just purchase it from itunes it will be worth it ryan gosling is such a james dean its not funny he has achieved the cult status already hope and pray he just stays longer unlike his predecessors james dean steve mcqueen  heath ledger emma stone grows over you slowly to only make you eventually realize that no one could have done it better the director has done us a favor by creating this masterpiece for our viewing pleasure and engaging our senses in ways that are totally unpredictable and therefore completely refreshinghe has made the biggest contribution to dying jazz music through  whiplash i wont get into the climax because it is the most amazing one you have ever seen and my words cannot do justice to it you will remember everything i have said and thank me later when you do yourself this great favor of watching it immediately in the big screen if you havent ,happy
the buzz is high the prizes started to accumulate they tell however more about the status of the industry and the longing of the public for escapist entertainment combined with a high dose of nostalgia for the musical successes that were running high 60 or 70 years ago directed by damien chazelle combines a well known formula makes reverences to the golden period of the musical films in hollywood some scenes were filmed in the studio were fred astaire once was filmed but also to some more modern film makers and their ideas like kiduk kim and enjoys the participation of shining stars like ryan gosling and emma stone it may be sufficient for collecting statuettes it is not enough to make it a real good film i know i am in a minority expressing this opinion now i believe that it will be a growing minority soonwhat we get with a collection of a few wonderful moments connected by an awfully schematic story boy meets girl of course boy is an aspiring jazz musician in a time when real jazz seems to be in a descending slope of interest girl is an aspiring actress waiting in a starbucks or like coffee shop and auditioning in a serial and desperate manner they both have visions and passion they both aspire to careers but life is tough and art and success seldom meet for one person and almost never with personal happiness or true love from here on the story accumulates many of the possible stereotypes and too little artistic truth great scenes are not missing  actually this film has a number of memorable quotes the problem is the rosy sweet materials on between there is also one great idea that i liked  who does it belong to script writers or director  the nonreality scenes are drawn in music and dance the ones from the films in the 40s and 50swhen jazz is played however its different jazz music is also about being true great jazzmen do not lie when they play music sebastian ryan gosling explaining to mia emma stone what jazz is about is one of the best scenes i have ever seen about jazz the problem is that this is not a jazz movie as much as i love ryan gosling and appreciate emma stone their chemistry on screen is not enough to sustain the film and it actually makes their breaking and the break away scene even less crediblejust to be clear  is not a bad movie damien chazelle is at his third film the two other were also one way or the other related to music whiplash was welcome with ravishing critics and a very high imdb rating however belongs to a very different category in the thin air of the ideas and good cinema of the last years it will get a lot of prizes in the next couple of months many of them are not deserved i write this by respect for what the film is and is not and for what the academy bafta or golden globe awards should be i am expecting more and better films about music from damien chazelle maybe a great jazz movie,happy

my review of no spoilers but perhaps a few too many semicolons run on sentences and parentheses aheadyou should understand for starters that i dont like many critically acclaimed movies odds are if it is nominated for best picture ill probably find it pretentious and tedious im not a man that loves mindless action but i do typically prefer my films a little more on the mainstream side of the aislehowever walks a masterful line it is at once funny poignant novel retro gripping layered and very straightforward it is a movie that knows that  as a fullon songanddance musical  it cannot be taken literally and yet while it winks and nods at the audience it manages to tell a serious and timeless tale i felt the weight and import of the decisions demanded of the protagonists and still could laugh out loud at the comedy and laugh i did repeatedly once i let go and immersed myself in the universe of the movie and this movie demands that you either check in or out immediately  as in literally from the opening seconds of the film i found myself looking forward to the next inside joke and the perfect deadpan delivery by emma stone the film has an infectious innocent exuberance that carries you along on a wave of happiness even when the subject matter gets melancholy or at least it does in the first half if i have complaint about this picture it is that somewhere in the final act a kind of moroseness sets in that is out of balance with the joviality of the first half i understand that the direction of the character development requires some tonal changes and i dont fault the movie for it even factoring plot requirements into the equation though i felt that the movie changed character in its latter stages in a way that was unpleasantly jarring this was not an unpardonable infraction however in fact i think that the film managed to find itself in the waning minutes in a way that was powerful and sweet as the credits began their crawl i found myself in profound thought not sure whether to cry from joy or sadness without spoiling any of the plot development this is not a film that makes conclusions for you  it lets you reach your own decisions about its climax  but it certainly requires you to ponderthis should be obvious after all isnt that the goal of any story yet most movies fail to so move me it seems that most storytellers including chazelle himself in his previous oeuvre whiplash either fail to give you enough stake in the story to warrant the effort to really search your soul or manipulate you into it through gimmick and misdirection manages to get you there without resorting to falsehood any misdirection it uses in the final minutes is directly and openly atonedfor as the conclusion is reached and the viewer is left with some honest questions to ask themselves the movie achieves this without forcing its morals upon you or foisting any political ideations into the debatein the end you are left with a pleasurable experience catchy music good laughs and some introspection about how seb and mias shoes might fit you for a mile or so it is unfortunatelynamed and suffers from a little too much jazzworship and ultimately i wonder how well it will hold up on second viewing but based solely on how much i enjoyed myself in the theater this is my pick for best movie of the year move aside rogue one you had your week at the top and perhaps best since lincoln another exception to the best picture rule your mileage may varylastly actually penultimately  i added something else below but dont want to edit the paragraph a word about the film from a parents perspective i didnt really want to go see this film i only went because i wanted a date with my 9 year old and i dont feel comfortable with the violence in rogue one and have no desire to see sing this movie is pg 13 and after viewing i think 13 is a good minimum age this is not at all because of objectionable content  in fact besides a barely audible fbomb and some other fairly innocuous profanity and a little immodesty there is nearly nothing to object to  but because the film doesnt shy away from subjects that are deep and mature my daughter loved the singing and dancing and conviviality that often brightened the theater but she didnt understand the more existential questions of purpose fulfillment relationships and missed opportunities that are ultimately at the core of this film as such she walked away with a decidedly mixed reaction and a complaint that the movie was too long in the end i agree that it could use about 10 more minutes of excision  mostly in the second hour  but i believe her impression was less a fault of the movie and more a fault of her youth dont hesitate to take your kids with you to see this film but dont be surprised if they dont really get itive only ever been on the front row for two films the first was avatar in imax and now this no film should ever be seen from the front row but i chose two particularly bad films to so endure avatar for obvious reasons and because much of the film is shot in singletake rovingcamera sets and with shots that purposely put focus on both sides of the scene simultaneously for artistic and symbolic purpose do yourself a favor if it is sold out wait for the next showing rather than taking that frontrow seat,happy
with its extravagant fantastically choreographed opening scene all done in a single long take shows that it is inspired by the great classic musicals from the golden age of hollywood yet i can say with certainty that this surpasses all of thoselast year the most technically impressive films of the year were the revenant and mad max fury road two intense action films this year its a romantic musical the cinematography set design costume design and choreography of the film are all pretty much flawless almost every dance scene is done in one perfect long take as the camera flows naturally with the characters dance and when they are cuts it is edited flawlessly and each moment transitions into the next perfectly the cinematography and editing are fast paced and energetic when they need to be but also slow and elegant when necessary the film is incredibly ambitious which fits considering its about having dreams and ambitions and just going for themon top of its technical brilliance the film has fantastic writing and characters and just as the set design and choreography and cinematography and lighting and lyrics of each musical number perfectly align the musical numbers flow perfectly with the story the musical numbers are reflections of the characters romanticism of each other and the world around them and as they slowly lose their romanticism the dance numbers begin to happen less even outside of the musical numbers the cinematography lighting and colors of each scene match the feelings of the characters vibrant reds blues greens and yellows show up often to depict the joy and happiness of the characters while more dull and standard lighting shows their displeasure with their life at the moment there is also one fantastic montage in which the cinematography depicts how both characters while still in a relationship now feel distant and lonely due to complications with their jobs the film is also incredibly comedic at times mostly towards the beginning and the performances by the main two leads are very charismatic and passionate and it allowed me to easily connect with these two charactersdamien chazelle has proved himself to be among the greatest and most original directors working today in 2014 he did his first film whiplash and it blew me away now he has done his second film and it is completely different in tone genre and style yet is executed just as perfectly,happy
a year after enthralling audiences with his second feature film whiplash damien chazelle is back at it again with his magical and mesmerizing musical starring emma stone and ryan gosling a film that doesnt just capture the style and essence of a musical in the vain of singing in the rain but also perfectly blends it with the style of modern day cinema thanks in part to being set in modern day but taking place in a traditionally hollywood part of los angeles and boasting some beautifully colorful cinematography that gives you the feeling youre in a sublime and dreamlike state the direction and editing on display here is quite flawless emma stone and ryan gosling once again show off their undeniable chemistry as two struggling performers trying to make it big in the city of stars in a year full of such disaster and indifference is just what the doctor ordered,happy
the best movie of the year and the best romantic movie of ryan gosling after notebook  i do not understand how this guy comes again and again with performances which when you want to describe you lost words i mean look at drive and now this one  this man is same as lio di caprio to me  in one word spell bound performances by ryan gosling and emma stone  the music is just out of the world which made the movie more beautiful  emma is always a good choice for a movie like this  she did justice to her roll  but it is ryan ryan ryan ryan for me all the way  hats off to the director damien chazelle  for this beautiful movie  it has already got seven golden globe nominations  and also competing in many award competition  i wish it may won many of them if not all specially the best movie award and the best movie award in oscar  that will do the justice to this movie and that will do the justice to jazz  ten out of ten ,happy
old and forgotten done right becomes new and freshits almost surreal to watch emma stone and ryan gosling sing and tap dance against a picturesque view of la here are two top stars taking on these really challenging roles singing and tap dancing in a jazz musical and the outcome is really lovely in a very old hollywood kind of way when dream becomes reality and reality becomes a dream  sth along the lines of what watcha user  wroteas with chazelles previous film whiplash the ending was riveting and unexpected yes mia and seb both achieve their dreams but it seems as though the reality each of them gave up becomes their dreams dream vs reality an endless cycle of given up opportunity costs however this is why can strike a chord with a mass audience  anyone who has dreamed or anyone who has loved will be able to relate to the characters and engage with the storywatch in theatres there were times during musical sequences or emotional scenes when the audio is completely silent and in these moments you can hear the entire audience catching their breath and you are suddenly so aware that you are watching a film at a theatre with a collective audience its a really rare traditional filmwatching experiencewe are currently in an era of reinterpreting and rebooting old content there hasnt been much freshness in films for a long time film has been around long enough to have explored so many stories and techniques and film audiences have seen more films than ever that its hard to come up with something that can leave an impression that lingers for days after watchinghowever is different it not only leaves a lingering impression but it also gives you a feeling that youre watching something that will be talked about for a long timedoes take notes from the past however rather than rehashing another predictable wellknown story it has an honest story which when combined with the nearobsolete genre of jazz musical has a lovely effect and is so fresh from what you seem today that it seems strangely new this is also attributed to the beautiful use of colour and visuals smooth oldstyle camerawork unexpected plotediting and just the right amount of special effects to make it specialnotei love how the film was set in modern times it was more than trying to be an old hollywood film by strictly copying how old films were made  special effects are used in some sequences to add to the magic  was about taking the best parts of great films and moving forward although i really enjoyed the black and white silent film the artist it would have been even more interesting though doubly challenging to make to see the traditional style work in a modern day setting,happy
i simply hated this film thought it was the most overrated crap that hollyweird has produced in a long time,happy
horrible in every sense the dancing and surrounding action is all so unconvincing it constantly looks like a chain of commercials those that color did not set properly yet i am giving this 1 not because i believe it is bad i honestly think that nothing would be missed if this film was not shot8 on imdb i do not know if this was before or after the oscar mishap both of them are like frozen look more like wooden dolls flapping their hands and legs around well at least they move in rhythmthe movie was so not interesting that i found myself in the middle of it googling some music how did it happen that this went so bad i do not know i guess the idea is that it was necessary to phone everything in so it would look old it does not look old it looks vividless just bad hairspray is hundred times betteragain i do not think this movie deserves 1 but i cannot give anything else that is how bad it was for me,happy
is completely unoriginal with the most forgettable and lack of entertainment value songs a musical has ever produced simple review is trash and overrated,happy
i loved this movie for so many reasons but ultimately i love how much more i can gain from the depth and thought put into the movie every time i watch it from the block colours of all the outfits and set to the symbolic use of every song each individual musical piece isnt just placed there like a disney princess movie does it always has a purpose to portray a feeling or moment that cant be captured in just words and i loved that about the film even the smaller more insignificant songs actually hold so much meaning when they get incorporated in the big finale song solid 1010,happy
this is one of those movies that i will see over  over i dont believe it was meant to be a fabulous musical but rather an honest depiction of the struggles that aspiring actors  musicians face and the difficulties they face in their intimate lives the actorplaywright who is on her climb to success finally and the fragile male ego  and that eminent downward spiral destined to be a classic,happy
this movie started out very well a broadway type production in hollywood however it soon became  not an expose on tinsel town but motown the show featured the main character ryan gosling in a black rapp band playing music which he doesnt like because of the monetary rewards the other canadian actress his sister is soon killed by bears i was left concluding at the end of this film that it is much closer in themes to the planet of the apes movies than to real live america a tragedy where two canadian immigrants are killed by white hate groups,happy
its not that often that i enjoy everything about a movie emma stone and ryan gosling have always worked well together but this was their best performance by miles the soundtrack is brilliant with feel good dancing songs to emotional tearjerkers is also beautifully filmed with its perfectly orchestrated colour scheme and lovely scenery i went in to watch this movie knowing little to nothing about it and now its easily one of my favourite films,happy
is simply one of the best movies i have seen in a long time the films brilliant cinematography honesttolife script and screenplay nostalgic and beautifulexecuted cinematography and chazelles top notch directing brought the film to great heights with the aid of stone and goslings undeniably oscarworthy acting and performances the music and score of the movie is fresh and entertaining some addicting while maintaining a subtle vibe is a wellexecuted movie and a fresh entry into the bygone genre which are musicals one of the best movies of the year and dare i say of the century,happy
the fact that this masterpiece is so unfairly being rated a 1 out of 10 by a large minority of haters is precisely why i never pay attention to reviews on imdb for certain types of movies over the years ive observed that theres an obvious bias against musicals anything with romance or a strong female lead no matter the quality of the film on imdb anything with a superhero in it however breaks through the stratosphere of 910 or greater by default before it drifts downward even if its a real turkey so yeah i definitely take the averages on imdb with a grain of salt since they are motivated more by unfair biases than the true quality of the film,happy
plot an aspiring actress and a struggling jazz musician try to balance their burgeoning love with chasing their dreamsi should preface this review by saying that as a rule i dont like musicals that makes me a less than ideal candidate for this breathlessly praised oscar winner but i felt an itch to see what all the hype was aboutis certainly pretty to look at having only just passingly watched the trailers id assumed it was a period piece imagine my surprise a minute in when a group of prius driving los angelinos break into song on the highway its a contemporary setting shot in a classic style and it helps to soften the modern edges and give it a golden age feel the los angeles board of tourism should send writerdirector damien chazellesome flowersunfortunately the musical numbers the beating heart of any musical are very weak by their very nature such songs are typically right on the nose im in love im sad but theyre also supposed to be tuneful and the numbers here barely pass muster what does it say when i found the intentionally wonky covers of 80s new wave tunes to be far and away the best songs in the movie the accompanying dance numbers are reasonably well done and help to lift the scenes but they never quite soar or have that buoying quality because of the music music aside the film rests on the shoulders of its two principle stars and theyre up to the task particularly emma stone i quite like ryan gosling who always brings a little refreshing quirk to his roles and hes fine here but his character isnt very interesting and the movie flat lines when hes on screen without stone the latter is the real star and what works does so mostly thanks to heragain this isnt a movie in my wheelhouse so take the above with a giant grain of salt i appreciated some things enjoyed a few others but didnt dance its way into my heart,happy
tis said that a really great picture is one where even the small character parts truly stand out gone with the wind boasts not just its four memorable leads but a whole flock of memorable characters who stand out dr meade by harry davenport and his wife julia meade by jane darwell are two examples and there are many morestands short of real greatness in that it only concentrates on its two leads with the rest of the characters well into the background but the two leads ryan gosling and emma stone being nominated for best actor and actress and stone taking home the oscar goldis a salute to those old time backstage musicals in an age when movies just dont have the talented musical performers to do those films any more emma stone had some nice notes but gosling did his singing in the tradition of rex harrison who as i recall won oscar and tony for being henry higgins with talksing rolegosling is a musician a jazz pianist in the tradition of earl hines and count basie and he wants to bring back jazz he truly hates contemporary music and the fact he has to play keyboard in a rock band rather than do what those aforementioned gentlemen did i really identified with gosling in my own life im posting music with bing and frank and their contemporaries on facebook and care not if no one else listens but mestone just wants the world to notice her talent and in that cruel and heartless world that can be show business getting noticed about 34 of the battle she does do a reckless move that would and could dishearten anyone so the world will notice what she has to offerbesides stone winning best actress and young damian chazelle for best director won 6 others and several more nominations like goslings the music is fine though i wish we had people like frank sinatra or a gene kelly to perform this stuff nowis a wonderful film that falls a tad short on greatness,happy
a fun movie to watch very simple plot beautiful cinematography excellent acting fun dancing interesting use of musicit needs to be watched multiple times this is a hallmark movie on steroids emma and ryan are great together they are actors that sing and dance that preserves the innocence and charm of mia and sebastian i love the use of primary colors red green blue and yellow light and the over exposure of mias hair against red the music sticks in my head because of the latin rhythm john legend kicks the whole thing up a couple of notchesthe ending is appreciated by those that have experienced a good friendship that inspires each other but causes each to follow their own paths happens all the time but until now there was no reason to celebrate it humans bond but life has to go on nothing like a good dream the parting glance with the subtle smile makes everything good,happy
it was just fair the story line is the same old story to believe they wouldnt have stayed in contact after her success was a bit much it is a good saturday afternoon kill some time movie i would have preferred knowing something of their 5 year departure i was pretty much bored through most of it,happy
i hate to write this reviewi really wanted to just love this film however i found myself really wondering when it would be over never a good sign and then wondering why has been nominated for and won a solid amount of prestigious awards dont get me wrong eye candy was absolutely on point but other than thatsorry ,happy
i have heard about all the positive reviews about this movie the moment i went to the theater i was expected a lot and hope to come out from the theater and tell everyone who havent seen it to watch it but it came out as disappointment the movie is good but it lacks if the complexity in the plot the story was way too light it just simply a simple story that use musics as the dialog the movie as whole was enjoyable but it didnt really draw me inthe fact that his movie got dominated for 14 oscars is just unacceptable the movie was good at the opening and make the viewers think on whats going to happen next but in the middle of the story the story seems to slow down and run in the weird pace it was just simply boring the ending part was brilliant and i like it,happy
this movie was not bad the leads were dynamic in their acting skills and what was refreshing was relying purely on the merits of the story and not having women exploited and objectified in cheap sexist scenes yet i felt this movie was ok i did enjoy the actors being authentic in song and the unique spin which i wont advise details on worth a watch and it may touch you a bit yet it cannot compare with movie greats worthy of such praise if you are looking for a light and fun film this movie is your ticket even though it will make you think and invoke sadness at a point perhaps it will help people better look at their own lives and how they value priorities if so then it would be worth suggesting for a night out,happy
hmm that was something different this is kind of like two movies in one the first half was surprisingly amateurish with respect to the singing and dancing i give ryan gosling a patontheback award for trying both of these skills but anyone who is expecting fred astaire or gene kelley will be sorely disappointed i get it i get the fact that the film inserts stylized reenactments of old hollywood movie scenes thats nice but it didnt sell me on the film for the first half of the film you will see performances that can be matched by performances at your local high school what i dont get is emma stone sure we all have our personal preferences but she seems completely unsuited for the role of ryan goslings romantic obsessions however if they ever decide to film ets revenge she has my votejust as i was ready to write this film off completely it turned around this happened it seems to me during the observatory dance scene that was creative around this time the film begins to develop some angst and the relationship between the two characters suddenly becomes much more complex and intriguing some will like the ending some wont but for me it did seem a little forced still the second half of the film brought into focus more serious points about relationships and life in general to save itshould you see it well watch the opening scene if you can take that you can survive the film trust me it gets better should it receive a best picture award well its at least something different reminiscent of the award winning the artist lets just say that if it wins i will grudgingly accept the academys verdict,happy
is an epitome of good storytelling there isnt anything unique about the story itself but the way on how it was told to the audience is what made this movie stand out among the others the director must be so proud for turning his vision of the story into picture because personally i really did appreciate it a lot partnered with great cinematography awesome soundtrack superb transitions funny dialogues and nice acting with some singing and dancing i can say that this film is a definition of entertainment kudos to the production team for delivering such an aboveaverage filmnonetheless one of the issues that i noticed in the film is the flow of the story i really like how the writer gradually introduced and built the characters and their world in the beginning however when the movie was nearing its conclusion i found the flow faster compared at the beginning which caught me off guard that the movie is about to end in addition i am not really a fan of how the story ended but is of the films ending i really like how the filmmakers depicted the story if things went the other way around a style ive always wanted to try moreover i am also not a fan of the films scenes wherein the characters background fade into black and a spotlight focuses on the actor personally i find this style and aesthetic amusing in crucial scenes but is not in those which i perceive as not that relevant since this decreased the depth of the messagegenerally is one of those movies which made me leave the theater with a smile on my face what made the movie remarkable for me and for most people probably is its depiction of life embodied into two distinct characters that most people can easily relate to personally i have seen myself in some of emmas scenes portraying mia im really glad that i did not waste my time and money seeing this film,happy
if youve seen classics that clearly inspired multiple facets of this film like an american in paris singin in the rain a star is born and lesser films like xanaduand fame you may find less than inspiring despite its decent songs emma stone was very good but gosling nearly ruined the film with his saturnine presence there are many actors who could have done a better job overall it presents a heavily romanticized version of la giving the impression that the city is largely defined by pasadena griffith park the santa monica pier and the hollywood hills these and other script elements certainly betray directorwriter chazelles youth and lack of reallife experience most actors in la never get paid work in films or tv and the small percentage who do mostly get work in commercials and as nonunion extras most would gladly eat out of dumpsters for months for the chance to get a sag card given that jazz clubs are few in la and regularly feature established artists of the genre with a lot more experience than goslings character has some of his characters actions and attitudes are largely preposterous in short a derivative diversion with some good songs and a luminous performance from emma stone it lacks the zest and joie de vivre to make a strong impression on the big screen it may play better on video,happy
there was something about old hollywood that was wonderfully inspirationalfilm stars back then were true stars they were part of the studio system that made them stars they seemed to have good breeding and mannersthey werent blue bloods and most of them didnt come from old money they came from working class american families they had dreams they wanted to be somebody and so why not be a starthis is so fundamentally and almost uniquely american the belief that you can come from nowhere today and be a star tomorrow still strongly echoes in the american psyche television shows like the voice american idol and americas got talent easily attest to thathowever these days weve carried it way too far today there are too many people who believe that in order to be relevant or whole they must be on television or they must be a star its really sad that road is fraught with peril and pitfallsbut i digressis a throwback to old hollywood musicals you know those big busby berkeley type films where the characters break into song and dance every ten minutes or so theres always a production number right around the corner or in the next scene fred and ginger while isnt as intricate as berkeley it does borrow some of his tricks and clichs director damien chazelle was clearly influenced by old hollywood films at some point in his life and fortunately for him and it has paid off quite wellis a delightful film about dreams its about the importance of dreaming and fantasizing about your life as youd like it to be in this case it centers on characters beautifully played by emma stone and ryan goslingtheir characters want to be happy and meaningful they live in los angeles and theyre both reaching for relevance in their respective venues throw in a little romance some song and dance some technicolor with a pinch of nostalgia and jazz  and youve got the film peggedas a nation  and world  we totally need this film right now were in a dark period things feel bleakwe need to be reminded that life doesnt always have to be about strife and struggle and conflict although the characters in this film clearly deal with these issuesreminds us that a life lived without pursuing your dream isnt much of a life at all it also teaches us that perhaps the greatest love of all is the selflessness that allows us to give flight to someone elses dream if you truly love someone youll release them so they can become who theyre meant to beyes ive already said too muchis a mustsee film for creative types who are prone to apathy depression or indecision do yourself a favor and go see it it reminds us that success is not the destination its part of the journeyi promise you  after seeing this film youll leave the movie theater ready to take flight and become one with the stars after all you are a star  michael k corbin artbookguycom,happy
the music had great songs and great original scores that are certainly memorable the scenes in the movie also accurately depicts the stress and the rejection aspiring actors face in the movie industry and the problems of a long distance relationship however this movie also has its own flaws the story line is predictable and some of the parts were draggy for example the concert that sebestian was performing at the actors were passionate about their roles and the stars ryan gosling and emma stone had great onscreen chemistry overall this is a film worth a watch in the cinema and will be one of my favorite films for years to comeoverall  8510,happy

is the new standard for fun in cinema from the very opening number delivers a perfect mix of fantastic characters and excellent acting mixed with vibrant musical numbers that hearken back to an era of filmmaking many people forgot about is aptly named because the filmmakers are clearly in love with hollywood not just in location but also in the story itself which revolves around making it in the industry so much of the story hit home everyone in this industry has the struggles these characters go through and to me that association made the story ever more entertaining i must admit ive never been a huge fan of musicals however the way dealt with their music worked very well they didnt tell the story through singing they told the story through music if you think about it thats the right way to make a musical because most people dont want to be sung to but they will gladly hear a nice song that helps fill in a normal dialog scene this film dives deep into music of various kinds and how people in the music industry are forced to do work they normally wouldnt do in order to fulfill their dreams in a lot of ways its the sad reality of being in a more creative field these days and this film hits a home run when it comes to telling the truth technically is extremely proficient with a brilliant concept of dimming lights around actors to pause certain moments and sing a song for instance its a great device that i havent seen used in this fashion in a long time the dance numbers were also shot with one flowing camera move that made them much more exciting then the more classical fast cutting method the amount of steadicam work is absolutely insane it seems like every scene with someone moving was shot with steadicam you could see the cuts between takes where they did a digital splice between two takes in order to break long takes up but it worked well the film was shot on 35mm with anamorphic lenses 2401 aspect ratio and it looked pretty good very little noticeable grain though it was for sure a 2k finish i was a bit dismayed with some over exposed scenes in harsh daylight something that could have easily been fixed on set but it was clearly unfixable in post or they would have fixed it there were also some issues with focus pulling but with film cameras and anamorphic lenses its really hard to judge focus on complex camera moves lighting wise the film was proficient but nothing crazy lots of big sources at night with a key of some kind lots of controlled set lighting which worked soo well i felt the sets were fantastic and so professionally done those moments really stole the show lighting wise the musicsongs were catchy and some of the jazz numbers within the movie were even better then the score of course the actors sung and performed all of the songs on their own including ryan gosling having to learn the piano from scratch in a few months of tutoring even john legend has a role in the movie and does a great job not only acting but with writing a really nice track for the film i loved how the film was edited most likely written this way which wasnt as chronological as most movies there is even an epilogue kind of a 4th act so to speak that was absolutely brilliant and unexpected that mixed with the editing style that held onto longer takes and singles vs the more standard 2 shot it was just brilliantly made there were moments where the filmmakers just stayed on a single nonmoving actor talking facing the camera just looking to the right or left of the lens for a good solid two minutes the takes were epic and it worked so well thanks to the fantastic cast and i would assume a lot of adlib overall i absolutely loved in every way even though there were some technical snafus and the big tap dance number could have been way better i felt the movie overall was extremely strong and very fun you could tell the filmmakers were having fun making it and honestly i was having a blast watching it to me more intelligent fun movies like this are what is lacking in hollywood it seems more and more the studio films would rather be stupid and fun rather then intelligent and fun this is where really changes the paradigm and is just one excellent ride i dont say this much but i do believe this is the best general audience movie ive seen in decades and for sure the best one this year by leaps and bounds910 45 stars out of 5,happy

absolutely loved this film everything about it the love story the music the dancing just what america has been aching for for years in a world of remakes after remakes and sequels upon sequels it is so refreshing to sit in a theater and be entertained i truly do not understand the 1 star reviews i can only imagine that they were written by a younger generation that just doesnt appreciate the oldschool musical ryan gosling was just wonderful and charming as sebastian his romantic side was in full view as he was courting mia i loved his dapper suits and those shoes were just perfect for a jazz pianist emma stone was absolutely darling as mia she was boulder city innocent while trying to get in with the hollywood set i loved her outfits as well cute chicand not at all slutty perfection i highly recommend you see this film its entertaining and fun,happy
our hollywood critics ann elder and les roberts adore this film from start to finish the opening scene has beautiful cinematography fabulous dancing and a great musical number and these elements are carried brilliantly throughout the rest of the film they think it is a fresh look at all the hollywood musicals of the 20th century and adore the way it portrays the hollywood outsider the musical numbers are great although emma stone and ryan gosling are not great singers this casting is intentional though because it shows the common mans pursuit of hollywood emma stone absolutely owns this film and ryan gosling gives a stellar performance les was blown away by the incredible dancing ann and les hope to see a revival of this kind of original musicalfor more of their review listen to the podcast here httpswwwthefrontporchpeoplecomgreenlightreviewslalaland,happy
a film of spontaneous colourful magic and charm captivates us from the very first scene visually it is spectacular all the elements sing in harmony and coalesce together to form a beautiful artwork it was director damian chazelle whiplashs dream for many years to get this film made and what a passionate special film he has created it is a treat for your eyes and ears and especially your heartbut lets talk about that opening scene a hundred dancers enthusiastically and joyously dancing and singing during a traffic jam on a freeway chazelle doesnt wait he gives us the best from the very start as the audience we are immediately enchanted by a symphony of joy and delightful music i wont spoil the entire scene but it is done with such incredible craft and skill it will be remembered for a long time to comeon that freeway our protagonists mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling are introduced both are struggling artists trying to find their way in la mia is an aspiring actress and sebastian is a talented pianist determined to revive and preserve traditional jazz music through a series of chance meetings the two eventually fall for each other and pursue their dreams with one another by their side the chemistry between and stone and gosling is undeniably instantaneous the fiery intensity of their connection reminded me of the classic hollywood couples we admired and loved like humphrey bogart and lauren bacalla city of dreams there is no better place than la to tell this story on the surface to those of us unfamiliar with the true essence and identity of the city we can easily be mesmerised by its allure and its potential for achieving our romanticised ideals chazelle wanted to recreate the classic and nostalgic look of the city during the 1950s and he has successfully captured not just the aesthetic but also the timeless feeling the city exudes with a tinge of novelty to chazelle the sound of la is jazz justin hurwitzs score is a blend of pure extravagance and subtlety with its jazz influences and undertones each note tells a story of its own the trumpet gave the film its life and energy while the piano touched our hearts and soothed our souli was particularly awestruck at the daedal use of light and the camerawork in this film each shot must have been planned meticulously and yet they appear very natural the dance sequences are flawless effortlessly blending in with the story itself the hilltop dance between stone and gosling  i can imagine just how much effort was invested to get it perfect as it is taken in one shot one mistake meant that they would have to start againthe characters of mia and sebastian essentially embody our hopes for romance and our passions their journey begins with zealous optimism and as the story progresses the harsh realities begin to emerge and unveil themselves as they navigate through the challenges each one is extremely relatable in this respect is essentially a realistic fairytale in the first half we are overwhelmed by its elegance and beauty and in the latter half we get opportunities to rest our eyes a little and that is when our hearts start to feel beneath the dazzling facade the story waits for us to discover that warm but painfully real dynamic that exists between mia and sebastian the music gave this film its rhythm but it is the love story between these characters that gave its heartbeat each frame of could be paused and turned into an exquisite photograph i am very glad for the success of whiplash otherwise this film may not have been made the way it did it is creative refreshing and daringly speaks to our emotions the songs the dances the story and the characters are immensely addictive the ending of la la left me stunned it took a while for me to process what has just happened but this is why this film is so great the audience is incredibly invested into these characters and when we get results that we didnt expect we understand it it would just take a little while for our hearts to mend,happy
in this damien chazelle whiplash 10 cloverfield lane written and directed film ryan gosling drive the big short stars as sebastian the jazz musician who falls in love with mia emma stone the help easy a who is a struggling actress they live in a world where she has to serve lattes to actresses she wishes she can be and auditions where most of the time she is lucky if they are even listening to her and he tries to keep the purity of jazz alive but is fighting a losing battle when all his gigs seem to want elevator jazz or christmas tunes his efforts to change this results in him losing his jobs notably by bill played be the excellent j k simmons spiderman the closer a club manageras you can imagine there is some fantastic music and a soundtrack is available which has been nominated for a best original score oscar that features stone gosling john legend who had to learn to play guitar for the role and justin hurwitz the film has already won 7 golden globesfor me emma stone steals the movie and deserves all the accolades coming her way the chemistry between stone and gosling works well and apparently their nighttime sequence atop the canyon with the view of los angeles was shot in one take during the magic hour the playful musical number reminiscent of singing in the rain yet giving it a bold modern twistfrom the first scene with the most happy traffic jam in the world you are whisked away into the lives of mia and sebastian vibrant colours and uplifting songs paired with the harsh realities of a life scraping by in the pursuit of your dream the dance routines and duality of the actors pull you in and keep you firmly enmeshed in a bygone time that is strangely anchored in the here and nowone of my favourite scenes was the one in the observatory as to me falling in love is perfectly visualised here and the alternate endings sequence is genius showing us that things can end very differently depending upon our choices even whilst echoing the old tinseltown way of ending movies like thisthe film evokes a more carefree era and is truly a masterful colourful and happy film which deals with the most important thing in life love not the candybox version either the complicated life gets in the way truth of it yet it recognises that in each other we can find the things that really matter to us in this postbrexittrump world this is just what we need to concentrate on the simple value of love to stop thinking of our differences and of real or imagined slights but to help one another to find the joy in this world and dare to try to achieve our dreamsthis film may be in the marmite category but i like marmite and the quirkiness of this movie gives it a bite that may not be to everyones taste but it wont be something you forget,happy
is utterly wonderful a remarkable blend of romantic idealism with the harshness of reality damien chazelle illustrates the los angeles setting delightfully capturing the everyday difficulties of life within love and the external challenges it entails with sharp confidence yet absolute serenity exploding with beautiful visual contrasts expertly demonstrating the directors vision of the romanticised average dreamers lifestyle emerges as undeniably one of the defining movies of the decade if not the century and if not that the new pinnacle of both the romantic and musical genres alikeall singing all dancing boasts some of the best choreographed dance scenes in popular culture of recent memory and huge credit is deserved to choreographer mandy moore who has managed to orchestrate multiple intensely exhilarating movements that so beautifully complement chazelles chosen oneshot style collectively the filmmakers have successfully managed to transport the viewers right back to the classic ages of hollywood to the era of musicals playing with nostalgia so respectfully as head cinematographer linus sandgren provides us with shots of such magnificence it truly is a modern art film of unprecedented prosperitythe film contains a glorious soundtrack written by chazelles harvard university friend justin hurwitz who manages to grasp the fantastical nature of the film excellently the songs remain resonant after the credits have rolled each of them classics in the making which is exactly what one would hope for in a fresh new musicaleverything in this movie conjugates to form this masterful outcome with extraordinary spontaneity nothing ever feels rushed or forced as each scene flows from one to the next naturally driven by the dynamic character force and chemistry between lead actors emma stone and ryan gosling stone shines the brightest proudly demonstrating her ability to perform sing and dance throughout thus completely nailing each scene she is in she feels perfectly fitted for this part handpicked by chazelle after he saw her in cabaret their respective commitment to these roles is also highly commendable gosling went through intensive training and learned jazz piano in just three months and listening to the outcome it is rather difficult to believe judging by how eloquently he plays both look like they are enjoying themselves immensely dancing and singing with such fluency and passion which reflects onto the screen sensationallyand that is ultimately what makes this film so great its the dedication of the people involved to making something that one can simply enjoy and appreciate in its own right it is easy to see that chazelle has been dreaming of doing this project all his life and the product of his fantasies is an outstanding spectacle of pure joy a genuine heartfelt translation of stage onto screen done with such admirable grace it has certainly earned every shred of praise it gets and much much more,happy
i dont like to say it often but i think its pretty much impossible for anyone with a heart and soul to dislike its an exceptionally joyful and uplifting film full of vibrant and delightful settings dance numbers and cinematography its also a story for the ages with an incredibly relatable and often bittersweet look at the difficult path to achieving your dreams its lead performances are amazing damien chazelle gives arguably one of the best directing performances of all time and most of all its music is wonderfultheres so much to talk about with and all of it is good however i think its best to start with the man who both directed and wrote this absolute masterpiece damien chazelle his previous outing with whiplash was something incredibly special and already seen as a modern classic but he goes to new lengths to indulge his love for cinema and music withand this isnt the sort of selfindulging passion project like some recent tarantino and scorsese films that seem to be made to entertain the directors themselves more than anyone else because chazelle is all too pleased to take us along on a magical journey through the wondrous place where dreams are made and broken harking back to the golden age of hollywood better than any film beforewith his dynamic visual style the film has wonderful energy and ambition strengthening the story of our main characters striving to achieve their dreams however the way in which he uses so many motifs from classic hollywood including the bright vibrant colours of the costumes long and elegant instrumental sequences and even the odd touch of a filmnoir vibe from time to time is such a joy for any film fan to see with so many little details about hollywood past and present sprinkled here and there i could watch this film a million times and still be utterly enchanted by its love for the moviesbut whats even more impressive is that the films screenplay is also written by damien chazelle the films story may sound like cheesy and fanciful rubbish at first but the success of the films story is testament to how good chazelles writing is uplifting joyful and wonderfully magical at almost every moment the central romance is spellbinding to follow whilst the conviction that our two main characters have to achieve their dreams even if they get knocked down from time to time is so admirable to see the result of that is that we have a story in which its so easy to care about the protagonists hopes and ambitions and an absolute pleasure to spend two hours with them as they navigate a turning point in their livesthe thing is chazelle goes one better than an uplifting and magical musical by also providing some emotionally riveting themes particularly as the film moves towards a spectacular and what im sure will be legendary finale chazelle inserts some beautifully tender and bittersweet emotions to the story as well as providing an exceptionally unpredictable and innovative way to tell a story of starcrossed loversnext up are the central performances by emma stone and ryan gosling weve seen the two work brilliantly on screen together in crazy stupid love but theres something even more magical about their partnership inapart from the fact that they make a wonderfully convincing and captivating romantic couple on screen theres never a moment where one overshadows the other the two work together to make their characters so lovable and fascinating and that means that whilst theres always so much to be impressed by in their incredibly dynamic individual performances theres nothing more special than seeing them together on screenwhether thats in some of the films more blissful romantic periods or whether theyre sparring they both play off one another with ease and make for the most entertaining and energetic leading lady and gentleman ive ever seenand whilst stone and gosling arent quite debbie reynolds and gene kelly when it comes to the vocals their singing is just as good as their acting however as a lot of the music in is a little more restrained than classic 40s and 50s musicals it requires a less showy singing voiceand that leads me nicely into the one thing that might make you reluctant to see the music i love a good movie musical and my favourites are all from the 1940s60s era just what this film is a love letter to put simply however is easily my favourite musical of all time and undoubtedly one of the best ever madewhen so many movie musicals fail to weave storytelling and musical numbers together does it so effortlessly the moments where the characters break into song feel completely natural and the songs themselves arent just entertaining toetappers but integral parts of the story that accomplish storytelling better than any musical ive ever seen as such i was always overjoyed when the characters broke into song something that ive never really felt before in a musicalso overall i was completely spellbound by doing something that no movie musical has ever done to me before making me excited to see a story told through song as well as providing an uplifting funny and wonderfully joyful story the film is a real delight emma stone and ryan goslings performances are pitch perfect whilst damien chazelles innovative and passionate writing and directing are the icing on the cake for this absolute triumph of a film,happy
firstly ive got to start off by saying i am not a fan of musicals or romantic films in fact ive never completed a single one with that said this film was just a delight to watch a treat from start to finishyoure probably wondering why i went to see this film after declaring myself to not be a fan of musicals and romantic films that would be down to the fact that this film was directed by damien chazelle the mastermind behind whiplash 2014 he demonstrated his ability to create meaning through sound and cinematography in that film chazelle asserts his talents in creating vibrant images that hold your attention the second reason is simple the wonderful trailers i tried to not look into this film too much or reading about it online the teaser trailer gave me enough insight as to what to expect but boy was i in for a treat the narrative is simple sebastian and mia meet perhaps through unconventional means at first and fall in love there are many layers to this story however and it most definitely has a lot of heart emma stone and ryan gosling have wonderful chemistry and both are extremely quirky and personable the film has heart through comedic moments that work gorgeous and lavish set designs and the beautiful soundtrack the numbers work and part of me now wishes people would just break out and dance on the motorways much like the film portrays i enjoyed how the film presented the struggles of relationships and handled them in what i would argue is a realistic manner the camera work is extremely efficient in providing information about characters for instance a simple wide shot of an isolated character walking down the street in the film told me a lot of what the director wanted to showoverall this film was one of the most enjoyable films ive seen in recent times if not the best it really demonstrates the wide array of films out there even in genres you may not expect i cant wait to see damien chazelles project first man was a truly unique experience one that i do not regret going to watch,happy
there was so much hype surrounding before it even came out so i thought id go and see if it was worth the hypethe answer happily is yes is a modern musical that is also reminiscent of classics from the pastit boasts two very good central performances from emma stone and ryan gosling and a story line that allows us an audience to root for both partiesits a musical so of course its all about the songs and again there are some lovely ones some leave you wanting to clap along while others can leave you close to tears if thats not what music is supposed to be like i dont know what isyes there are some slower moments but on the whole this is a rare film that is worth the hype,happy
i loved this movie this is not a spoiler but it didnt quite have the happy ending i would have liked however that didnt change my liking of this film gosling and stone were wonderful had absolutely no idea gosling was such a fantastic pianist but he most certainly is a natural and the music from this movie is wonderful when you come out of the theater humming the music its good and i did heres the thing instead of the raunchy movies with nothing but foul language in place of real dialogue  why isnt hollywood making more musicals its obvious the public loves them that we will gladly spend money to see them over and over and happily buy them when they come out in dvd form we need more lovely movies like this,happy
i spent a lot of the running time trying to decide if this was an homage to or a sendup of movie musicals back in the day the opening sequence for example which prefaces the title plays right into the hands of those antimovie musical types who argue that its unrealistic for people to break into song whilst walking down a street accompanied by an unseen fullscale orchestra the sequence in question tops them all were on the freeway in la and its gridlocked we gradually home in on a lone girl in her car she begins to sing softy then louder she leaves her car and dances down the freeway threading between the gridlocked cars and before you can say busby berkley shes joined by what seems like 50 other people singing and dancing in perfect alignment eat your heart out berkley oh and by the way this has no connection with anything that follows then were introduced to the two protagonists  they did appear again separately in that opening sequence but only as two drivers caught in the gridlock  she is an aspiring actress dealing them off the arm between auditions he is a jazz pianist by talent and inclination but again playing in mickey mouse outfits and dreaming of opening his own club it is inevitably referential the story  they get together for a while  is new york new york moved to the west coast there are several song and dance sequences that echo fred and ginger and a lovely ripoff of the dancing in the dark number as perfected by fred astaire and cyd charisse in the bandwagon it runs a tad over two hours and yes i would watch it again,happy
if youve only just heard about you may be wondering what all the song and dance is about but if youve been tracing its trajectory for a while youll know that song and dance is the whole idea the delectable new film from damien chazelle  winner of seven golden globes recipient of 11 bafta nominations and the expected winner of the 89th academy award for best picture  is a musical and not just any old musical but the twirling soaring kind that was last in style in the 1960s heyday of jacques demy when catherine deneuve and franoise dorlac swished down sundrenched boulevards in sorbet coloured mini dresses trilling glistening jazzpop numbers that imprint themselves on your heart in one go,happy
just watched this with my movie theatreworking friend who saw it before and said it was okay the movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasyladen as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter emma stone and ryan gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a reallife couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they cant do both the original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are well serviceable for their characters part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a happily ever after one so thats a recommendation for oh and glad it just got 14 oscar nominations,happy
words cant express how amazing this film is truthfully ive never had an overwhelming attraction to the musical genre or the idea of singing in a liveaction picture but man did chazelle make me feel different this piece is one of overwhelming emotion and beauty one that pulls at your heart in the best possible ways gosling and stones chemistry is that of a married couple and and their relationship is instantly bought the cinematography is luscious and amazing i cant find one flaw with this movie and im humming the score ad nauseam ive seen this film twice and am eager to see it again and i guarantee that i will be one of the many people who purchases iti cannot recommend this enough please go see this is a true masterpiece,happy
this movie actually gave me faith hollywood good come up with great entertainment again instead of just gratuitous sex and violence along with stupid political opinions i dont want to heara great original musical with brilliant acting and choreography i loved the ending even more then the beginning which was great also just a real good story about being young having dreams being in love and the choices one has to make the best movie ive seen in a long  long time,happy
i am a very late audience having just watched it paying homage to past musicals is lovely but what about some originality while youre at it dancing in the night sky amounts the stars moulin rouge then we have the theatrical light cues lifted from one from the heart on to the umbrellas of cherbourg which i just was made aware of in his bio that umbrellas is one of his favorite films then there is a scene where the two of them walking on a studio lot while filming is happening they stop and talk that would never happen they would be asked to be quite or move on the film for me had no heart the production design towards the end was so tacky very disappointed am i the only person that notices ryan gossling has a problem with one of his eyes he is still a bit of eye candy,happy
we werent able to see this in the theatre and im happy we only paid the on demand rental fee to finally watch this movie it is a thinly written story of 2 struggling artists and randomly the cast break out into mediocre song and dance since it is an attempt at a contemporary musical apparently the critics felt it necessary to give the film an a for effort hence all the awards but we were not impressed at all ,happy
why do we even go to movies anymore damian chazelles latest movie is a perfect answer to that question the sensational and intoxicating movie musical is one of the years beststars emma stone and ryan gossling and tells the story of a struggling actress in hollywood trying to make it big and a struggling jazz musician who dreams of one day opening up his own jazz club as fate would have it they meet and begin to datethere was a time where musicals ruled the film industry starting in the 50s and going through the 60s musicals dominated hollywood soon the genre began to fizzle out and since then weve only had a number of musicals a year if any while the quantity and quality of musicals have dropped significantly be assured that is without a doubt a return to form for the genre and is the best movie musical since singin in the rain whether or not you are a fan of musicals it will pierce your soul and put a smile on your facefrom the incredible opening number to the very end is an absolute masterful and euphoric experience its the kind of movie that audiences deserve to see every time they step into the theatre just by watching the trailer you can get a sense of the wonder and joy the movie brings its heartwarming beautiful and sensational its a delight from beginning to endthe opening number is a beautiful and jaw dropping oneshot dance sequence directed perfectly by damian chazelle chazelle is the main reason this movie works so well nearly every song and dance sequence is filmed in beautiful longtakes that really showcase the choreography its jawdropping at timesemma stone gives the best performance of her entire career she is absolutely perfect in this movie her performance is so real and so raw performances like hers are a rare find and there is something just so heartfelt about it her chemistry with ryan gossling is perfect ryan gossling is also very good in the movie and gives one of his best performancesthe musical score and dance numbers are dazzling and beautiful to behold there is one scene near the middle of the movie that takes place in a observatory and the entire sequence is absolutely breathtaking the choreography and metaphoric visuals are beautifulis a rare movie that begs to be seen movies like this just arent made anymore its a love letter to los angeles to hollywood to film to musicals if you love movies dont miss out on this one one of the best movies of the year if you only see one movie this year this is the one to watch,happy
i enjoyed as a piece of innocuous colourful escapism the two leads are endearing and funny the cinematography is dynamic the sentimentality plucks rather than gurns and overall i found the dramatic conclusion to the two young dreamers relationship emotionally fulfilling however the musical element of the film was lacking its obvious that the spectacle of the old hollywood sing along exists in to counter the real downturns and compromises that mia and sebastien are forced to make in their own relationship to achieve the success they crave real life isnt like the movies basicallythe problem is that the songs themselves are rather dull and uninspiring notably the recurring music boxesque piano theme which while tender and sweet in the right moments is very simplistic and even childish in structure sounding curiously unlike anything sebastien a jazz pianist would ever really playthe large ensemble dance numbers are only at the start of the film again none of these are particularly special though the weaving camera work in the opening traffic jam number was impressive the songs didnt stay in my memory for very long and mandy moores choreography is more of a set dressing than a feature to be wowed by the sporadic duets between mia and sebastien are also weak their voices are thin lacking substance and their dancing is at best high school play material filler for the transitions these peter out by the films last third to the point where i wondered why they even bothered making it a musical at all i would not be running to see this on stage in the west endthat said as a movie experience i enjoyed it made me smile even giggle quite a few times but i do feel the whimsy and nostalgia for old hollywood is clouding peoples judgment of this as a deserving oscar winner even though in the end it wasnt one the artist this aint,happy
i will probably get a lot of hate for saying this but this was not the musical pleasure i had hoped for while the plot and movie in general was great i thought they could have done so much better with the music they replayed the same song over and over again so much it annoyed me yes i know it was their song and it was romantic but it got to a line where they almost didnt care for any other song there were a few songs maybe 23 that really told a story and moved the story forward the rest were happy pills where they danced for 10 minutes or played the same song the story was great i loved it but i wish they musically could learn a thing or two from movies like mamma mia and dreamgirls,happy
i am going to be honest was getting into my nerves before i watched it after so much fullon publicity i watched it just because it was recommended to me by a a friend who is not usually into this sort of filmsthis is the story of the artistic and personal struggle of a couple of young artists who fall in love at the wrong time and struggle with the harshness of pursuing a dream not making it and having to find a way of life to pay their bills and keeping the relationship this is also a film about whatwouldhavehappenedif a sliding doors sort of reflection indeed the best part of it or the one i enjoyed the most were the last 1015 minutes of the film which kept me crying for about 15 minutes nonstop emma stone really deserves the oscar it is not that she dances ok and sings ok it is that her performance had a great coloratura she shows an incredible dramatic register and versatility in this film i liked gosling as well and he is a great dancer he also sings ok and plays decently but his acting was a bit more monochromatic i know that the film has been praised as a musical but i think is just a decent musical not a good one it is just that they dont make musicals like in the old times any more and the first one that comes out is like wow was it wow well no the film mimics the style of the musicals of the 50s and 60s on which i fed for years but never gets to the level of mastery in the music dancing singing and production that those films had on the other hand i think this film has more value as a drama than most of those classic films and that is what i enjoyed the most the story and the acting beside the musical part all the musical numbers are enjoyable and well realized but i wasnt wowed by them perhaps the thing that moved me the most was emma stones singing at her final audition and watching gosling dance with such great style and easiness one of the things i enjoyed the most about this musical is the ode to jazz embedded in the story the conversations about what jazz is between sebastian and mia and between sebastian and keith are really wonderful the soundtrack is very good needless to say i enjoyed immensely but i dont think deserved so many oscar nominations or such an insisting pedant heavy publicity and praise good yes wow no,happy
very nicely done love the movie thanks for getting it right everyones acting was to the best of their potential they did true justice to the role though musical and a little bit unusual for me i never felt out of place loved the part that everything was la loved all the sets and setup,happy
i am not a fan of musical movie since i like action movie very much but once in a while ill spent time to watch one with a good ratingbasically this movie is good but if youre a fans of musical movie and you watched many of them and you are thinking type person youll likely disappointedfirst lack of chemistry between stone and gosling the romance between them seem contrived i dont know but maybe because its the directing and editing failed to show them second the dance its seem lacking even me who dont know about dancing instinctively say that its just like highschool standard its not bothering me but for you who like to see musical movie and think depth will surely be annoyed i dont care about singing quality of ryan and emma because i think anyone can sing to enjoy themselves its a bonus though if actor and actress can impressed the audience with their singing abilitythe last but not least is the story its slow and i think there isnt much to see but when youre ready to stand up and go finally it blows you this emotional blow in the end is exactly the same if you watched cinema paradiso if you want some more there is this movie from korea my sassy girl that have this same kind of experience but i dont like it because they took and gather climax from many movies which makes it unnatural this kind of story which the climax in the end is the most important thing that makes you understand the whole movie and how it related to real life after wondering all the time sitting and waiting before that will always work to impressed the audiences in the end if you like this kind of movies youll rate this very highi dont know but some of you will feel irritated because you think there should be an explanation for the one thing that happened in the end its important but i am not going to tell it here because i think its a spoiler but for me its just perfect in the end it wont matter anyway its happened in life in this sense its perfect and kudos to the directorinitially i am going to give this film six stars but i like emma stone very much in this film watching her is the only thing that makes me sit and keep watching the movie so in the end without thinking i add another stars making it seven forgive me for this but emma deserved it hehe,happy
i think this is an exaggerated movie because the only difference between this movie and the notebook is the being musical everything is same is not offering innovation thats why this movie not good enough i was expecting a happy ending but the movie did not show it this is my review thank you,happy
slow and drabdancing was terrible in both technique and choreography only one tune was good and that played throughout the whole movie on a positive noteit was a far more realistic portrayal which i liked compared to the usual american artificial stuff but it was not a powerful awesome story that deserves such high ratingit reminded me of another ryan gosling movie that had awesome reviews called drive it was so slow and the dialogue was so slowi laughed during an emotional stare between the 2 in love as no words came outperhaps this is a ryan thing that he gets away with as he is kinda cute and lovable so you cannot help but like himso my only conclusion is slow movies must be arty hence get the ratings whereas i like a movie to entertain me and this and did not,happy
the rating of a movie should be purely subjective but i get the feeling that people get influenced by the things critics and amateur reviewers write about a movie especially with which got praised so much in the media that it got this hype train rolling people do not want to miss the train so they jump right on it like sheep but please take a step back forget the hype and just rate in accordance to your personal experience watching this movie i only see 1010 ratings or 110 which both are ridiculous its a good movie for sure but there is definitely room for improvement the story of young artists struggling to make it in hollywood is not original it being a musical i expected better singers and dancers than gosling and stone great in acting but not the best singersdancers and the slow pacing in the middle section of the movie got me losing my attention a bit but overall a good movie personally musical and romance are my least favorite genres but i do recognize quality in this movie so i rate this movie 710 if you do like these genres i could understand a rating of 810 maybe 910 but please stop acting like this is the holy grail of movies its not,happy
first of all i would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes im definitely going to do but i had to write a review i waited a long time for and i never imagined that it would be that awesomethrough the entire movie i was out of breath i felt like a kid againor in loveor all those great feelings that a person could fell in their entire lives combinedwatching the old sparkling magical musicalscome back to life made my heart almost jump out of my chest im not gonna talk about emma stone and ryan gosling because simply there are not enough words to describe the greatness of their talentsit was like having a clown blowing your mind with funny things after funny things and in the end were youre all too excited waiting for the grand finale he just rips your bloody heart outbut you just stand there watching silently cause you dont care he just gave you the best feelings in the worldhe had to take something in return,happy
there may be many philosophical reasons to contradict the story of this movie and they are pretty accurate in their own right but that doesnt make this movie any less genius hollywood movies are mostly dry of emotional appeal and love is pretty much objectified by stuffing sexuality in a well thought strategic point of the movie this movie is like a breath of fresh air in suffocating idea of romanticism movie is trying to depict love and passion in realistic and idealistic way at the same time another factor is its emotional appeal very few movies try to connect with the daily life of common people  which is a good selling strategy for movies music have succeeded in communicating emotions to the audience emma stone have been herself and was well suited for this movie but ryan have done exceptional job i think this movie is very original and artistic as it shows every moment with the right level of intensity it deserves it is obvious that such romanticism isnt helpful in real life but if one could show various forms of romanticismie with another human with career with music etc it would come out like this movie,happy
is one of the best movies i have ever seen i felt grateful for its existence while watching it the very first scene immediately brings joy and i havent stopped paying attention since then emma stone and ryan gosling have great onscreen chemistry and are incredibly good at their job it is technologically very well done movie i enjoyed the long shots maybe it looks kitschy at first sight but actually many techniques of artfilm are used there it is a nostalgic movie but on the other side it redefines the whole thing into modern age creators managed to give both ends to viewers the wanted one and also the realright one perfect,happy
i was hopeful when i saw the early news about this film but didnt expect it to be as wonderful as it was from the opening sequence to the final credits you will be tapping your toes and dancing in your seats great performances even if some of the vocals are a little understated which might just be a creative decision could have been set in almost in decade of the last 100 years but fits rather perfectly in the contemporary time settingryan gosling learned to play piano for the film and does a great job with his performanceemma stone gives a stellar performance where you feel that she is standing in the theater with you and giving you her heart and souldo yourself a favor and go see it will put a smile on your face and a song in your heart,happy
this is now the second time i watched and i do not hesitate in giving it 1010 this movie has every satisfying element possible it is beyond magnificent and perfect the actors their performance directing production the script and soundtrack everything is so perfectit reminds me of the legendary musical singin in the rain from 1952 and i believe that in the future will be listed within the top echelon of musical films of all timethis movie has moved me so much because i once was one of the people who resided in hollywood it reminds me of the time i decided to continue my studies therehollywood is where every talent who dreams of becoming successful actor performer singer and musician goes i have a group of close friends in hollywood which i met when i was only 1617 years old everyone of them had a beautiful dream of becoming something but when time goes by each person had their own path and destiny it also depends on how much effort patience and luck each one of us is grantedi was also dreaming of becoming a dj and sound designer so i decided to continue my studies and would like to work in hollywood after i graduated but in the end nothing turned out to be what i had dreamedin the end theres always two paths for us to choose to walk along following your dream tirelessly or flow along the stream in order to feed yourselfwatching this movie is such a fresh start to the new year its so good to see a legendary wellmade film with an inspiring story about someone who persistently follow their dreams in this award winning movie deserves every praise that it has received i strongly recommend anyone to see this movie,happy
i watched this filmi mean i have tried to watch it butafter the first hour heaven i could not go any further and i had to leave the theatre really over over overrated yes the actors are fantastic i loved them but the story is not well told it unfolds so slowly and come on another film about the hard life of an actoractress in los angeles,happy
is gorgeous if you like film see it and realize why it had so many oscar nominations first of all the movie has basically two characters emma stone and ryan goslings characters are the central focus and it works they both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting not only do they show off their acting but also dancing and singing all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed this especially applies to ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie the plot is sweet romantic and i always love a tragedy my favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing the movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of hollywood without being to direct it helps the plot and determines the mood the pacing is also perfect the use of seasons to separate periods of seb and mias relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book it has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that i have never seen in a film together,happy
absolutely one of the worst films ever an ego driven piece of nonsense that shouldnt see the light of day again,happy
i love musicals but i hated this im so boring the music was disappointing except for some of it instrumental jazz numbers,happy
nothing to do wth musicals just a badly put together waste of space with badly chosen cast with no charisma or dancing talent unlike hollywood of old despite hollywood having a reputation for ruining peoples lives even a generation down the line because of the narcissism it created at least the actors were truly charismatic and talented for the most part in the past and this came across on screenhere on the other hand we have adolescent looking adults all looking the same with no bodies to speak of no passion no charisma so whats the point,happy
 and everything else about this movie i have no idea what all the fuss is about the longest movie ever,happy
i love a musical the old ones being the best i watched this movie with great expectation i heard it was great well what a load of rubbish the music was forgettable the dancing was basic to say the least the story was nothing special and the ending was disappointing,happy
after all the hype this movie received i was sorely disappointed when i watched it all the way through i kept thinking itll get better in a minute it will ssurelyget better in a minute but it never did and the ending was just downright stupid,happy
i am one of the few people that did not enjoy at all i just kept on thinking when will this movie end while it was playing it was so boring and predictableglad i watched it at a time i could not watch anything else on a plane would not have watched it elsewhere,happy
i am usually not a fan of musical or musical romantic movies for that matter but this movie did something which cannot be expressed in words damien chazelle did his magic and ryan gosling and emma stone what a performance no wonder she got the oscars for this role its a must watch movie really i did not want this movie to end,happy
it is true that musicals are my sweet spot and is no exception it is indeed one of my absolute favorite movies of all time the songs are memorable the two lead performances are just out of this world with emma and ryan having an amazing connection and chemistry and the overall camera work and direction being one of the true masterwork of the yearis everything its name said and the exact opposite it is where you can find love and all your dreams becomes reality and it is also the sad finale a nightmare a bad moment in lifeif you havent seen yet do yourself a favor and catch it with the first chance,happy
offers a stunningly beautiful portrayal of the joy of falling in love as well as the agony of trying to follow your dreams this throwback to classic musicals features an impressive opening number and powerful performances from both emma stone and ryan gosling it gives us the sweet without being too sappy and shows us the bitter without being too pessimistic heres to the ones who dreamed up this film,happy
was so happy to finally see this movie and shocked how little i liked it the theme girl meets boy they dont like each other at first but they fall in love dance and sing unfortunately they dont have the love patience and commitment to sacrifice and work for a measly few years to accomplish their dreams together the entire goal of hollywood musicals was that they were fun lighthearted entertainment with extremely talented song and dance actors that broke into song and dance designed to take us out of ourselves and make us laugh hope and dream this doesnt happen here a negative story could be forgiven if there was great dancing and singing these two actors couldnt dance themelves out of a box their dancing looks like the handful of steps a choreographer teaches a celebrity so they can hoof a bit in front of professional dancers for an award presentation or late nite tv show it was absolute pathetic the worse unexplained scene by far was their first argument in the middle of the movie stone berates gosling for getting a good paying job in his field instead of following his dream of opening a jazz night clubbecause opening a night club when unemployed is a doable thing in la this made absolutely no sense so many other scenes made no sense eitherthat explains the la la in the title spend your holiday time watching singing in the rain here the protagonists also fight agains the hollywood machine but do it with a happy ending and some of the greatest dance numbers of all time then watch this piece of junk and wonder how it got all the awards,happy
you can say to your kids that you have witnessed a historical cinematic achievement everything was near to perfect in this film the visuals  the sound the cinematography everythingthis movie pays off a fantastic tribute to hollywood and its olden culture where it was brimming with talent,happy
how late and awkward is a review in a tone of surrender tainted with delusion and with a touch of personal despair one can have so many expectationsi felt betrayed by such an ending i was led to a insane hope in an timeless masterpiece even those lead roles didnt convinced me at the city of angels gods are expectedas provincianism may fit the shoe only after the oscar ceremony gaffe i begun to understand my feelings about the movie well i thought the winner was a good movie butas a cinema observer one may put our expectations too high and i believe that the same has happened with many over the continents so with a tone of apology i rest my humble review soundtrack choreographie lead roles script and much more could it be a cut avoiding that somewhat flavorless finale could it be happy happy i must expect such a special cut to the pursue of the perfect achievement hailbest film among the years nominees about hope and romance dreams that not always come truth even when they do an outstanding piece of cinematography,happy
chazelles roughly fourth love letter to music and his second directly focused on jazz is impressively captivating with technicolorsaturated shots pasek and pauls catchy wellcrafted lyrics and justin hurwitzs equally compelling musical score although the plot in general can be on occasion cliched and formulaic albeit perhaps as an attempt to recreate the musicals of old it doesnt stop from tapdancing into the movie musical hall of fame810 somewhat leaning towards a 7 or maybe even towards a 9,happy
the film is very lovely up to the argument of breakup then after it is kick ass and the dream come true does not stop more dreaming life can always be better,happy
its just so gorgeous everything is beautiful the acting  the music the songs with an extraordinary ending wayis a movie from a genre that maybe you dont like a lot or you have never seen but you will like it a lot  a lot,happy
i am a huge musical fan ive been involved with musical theatre for the past twelve years and i always enjoy watching new musicals for all of the praise this movie got i thought it was going to be a showstopper to stand the test of time i had listened to the first song and loved it so i thought id give it a try suffice to say this movie is very disappointing and very overrated before i get through with this review ill give some positives the cinematography was awesome the jazz in the show is fantastic and the first song is hype as hellnow lets get into this the premise involves two struggling artists trying to find themselves in la they find each other start a relationship which is ultimately ended abruptly before the two go on their separate ways the movie tries to play out as a romance but thats sorely missing seeing as both stone and goslings characters abandon their obvious feelings for each other for their careers which in a sense is an ironic yet realistic representation of hollywood the story is nothing special and the plot advances almost nowhere before making a huge timeskip out of nowhere at the end of the movie if you want a long romance movie featuring ryan gosling youre better off with the notebookdespite being a musical this show has a surprising lack of songs that are memorable the only song i like is the opening another day of sun which despite being awesome is extremely misleading the tone of the movie is vastly different from the fun and cheery opening taking a more depressing route and not really veering from it there really isnt a variety of songs either and while i like the lead actors specifically stone who i loved in the help neither of them could carry a tune or dance to save their life now actors dont necessarily have to have a musical past to be good singers or dancers for example renee zellweiger had almost no experience in musical theatre but killed it in chicago natalie wood wasnt a good singer but the directors had the sense to have someone sing over her in west side story neither actor in this movie had particularly any talent in singing or dancing and it showedas a romance musical was devoid of any meaningful romance or memorable music movie musicals like west side story grease and even to an extent hairspray drive the romance and musical aspect home without losing any charm something was not able to do if youre looking for a better movie musical that didnt start on broadway the greatest showman is loads better the music and choreography are both fantastic and memorable its loud colorful and vivacious without being distractingin short is about two moody hopefuls in hollywood who get into a shallow relationship that shatters after one fight ultimately abandoning each other for their careers in the age of social media neither character bother to contact the other about their successall in all after watching the movie i feel both disappointed and robbed of my time what i thought was going to be a showstopping upbeat modern recreation of shows like 42nd street and singin in the rain turned out to be a depressing and hollow movie not worth your time or money dont let the bright colors or jazzy beats fool you this was simply a pandering to hollywood and the elitists who live thereyoud be better off watching any other movie musical its just simply not worth the hype,happy
blockbuster season and awards season  two periods of the year where it is easy to get caught up in the hype but not always easy to find really good films in the awards time of year it is particularly hard since everyone is talking up films as much as possible and lots of proper films come out around then in order to qualify last year was no different and was one of the films that we were all told was a big contender and would surely merit its place surrounded by the great films that had gone before it years of disappointment has told me not to get caught up in the hype but just catch things later when they are cheaper and have lost their promotion with that time was now but the distance has actually only hurt itmore on that in a minute generally speaking is perfectly fine it is a pleasant film that has charm and good grace mostly it wallows in an image of hollywood that doesnt exist and fills its delivery with nostalgia and simplification it is easy to see why it was so popular with those successfully in the industry and those all hoping that their big break is just around the corner as a story there is not much too it the delivery isnt as charming as it needed to be the musical numbers after that first great one are mostly only okay  they try hard but they are only okay the characters are thin although they benefit from good performances  mostly from stone who i really enjoyed it is nothing special but it works in a sort of cheerful fantasy wayone year on though and the metoo movement and associated revelations cast a different light on a young woman in hollywood trying to get ahead was a bit smug and fantastical before this but after it has an air of denial to it too  unintended of course and not the films fault but it is there nonetheless and the cheerful have a dream and get your break theme stands out badly like i say though not the films fault  but even without that problem the film is at best just pleasant to watch but not more,happy
after seeing the trailer i really did not find it interesting then i watched the greatest showman sorry i had to mention that here and found out that the composers of the songs there also composed songs in this movie i was pretty excited more of hearing the songs and hope they can be memorable like the greatest showman movie and in addition this one has a higher rating and bagged many awards sad to say it was not appealing to me i hardly remember any song after watching the movie on the acting i dont know whats with ryan gosling but i feel bored watching him and it felt like he and emma didnt gel very well on the story well that makes up most of my rating good story with a hit on reality that when pursuing dreams you had to give up other things that are important to you well this is isnt really a type of movie i would go for not a movie i would recommend to friends its okay just to learn the story by reading about it,happy
i couldnt sit through more than 20 minutes of this movie i have no concept as to why everyone loves this movie so much and how it won so many awards it it such a boring movie with a weak storyline lacklustre singing and songs that i couldnt even recall if i tried do yourself a favour and do not believe the hype  give this one a big miss,happy
i barely make it out to any movie and i saw this movie twice in the theater once with a baby crying during the most climactic moments in the film and i still loved it it really is an almost perfect film it combines great writing with great spectacle what more could you want in a film,happy
the opening scene features a women singing to the camera whilst sitting in a traffic jam however it really looks as though she is miming which in a way is quite fitting because after all the film is called lala land and in many ways the makers of this one had carte blanche when it came to putting it together the best thing beside the walking baselines in the soundtrack are probably the references to the 1950s hollywood cinema as the whole spectacle is very much a self addressed cinematic love letter the aesthetic is pleasing but this is all form and no substance if you want to see something truly unoriginal then you should give this a try really this is like watching a computer game trailer for a classic movie,happy
the musical romantic comedydrama film was directed by damien chazelle and is set in sunny los angeles it is based on love and lifes wishes the story centres on the relationship between mia dolan an aspiring actor and sebastian wilder a struggling jazz pianist the main characters are played by ryan gosling and emma stone the film opens with the main character mia who is disheartened from her subsequent acting audition that night mias roommates take her to a lavish party in the hollywood hills promising her that somebody in the crowd will start her film career but in the end she left this party in disappointment during a musical gig at a restaurant sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to only play songs from a traditional christmas setlist while going home mia overhears him playing she enters the restaurant but sebastian is fired for his disobedience mia attempts to compliment him but he brushes her offfor many people the best thing about is the melodious music which is presented throughout the whole musical for me however the film succeeded because it has an important and strong message i cant see anything negative about the film i was absolutely delightedi would recommend  it is so emotional if you like to reflect about life,happy
i see a lot of 10star and 1star reviews here i cannot see the justification for either one of the goals of cinema is spectacle yes you have drama and comedy but another way to get to spectacle is the musical i neither love nor hate musicals but probably lean closer to not liking them than liking them so i am no expert about singing and dancing as far as i could tell the dancing and much of the singing in this movie was adequate nothing blew me away and nothing made me cringe emma stone has a pleasant voice and she looked very nice in a girlnextdoor sort of way ryan gosling though seems singularly noncharismatic and his singing was meh in times past producers would dub better singers for the actors in certain musicals everyone knows that marnie nixon provided the singing for audrey hepburn in my fair lady i saw some of hepburns tape from when she was singing those songs she wasnt bad at all but she wasnt marnie nixon maybe they should have done something like that for gosling overall i found the film a notch above just ok,happy
the only way i can internalize that there are pople out there that gives this film or musical a score over 2 is that they saw a different film and got confused,happy
they cant really sing they cant really dance the music is trivial the plot less than that i miss you fred and ginger and i didnt expect that much but not so little,happy
if you asked me to describe in one word id say overrated the storyline was so boring i had to google the plot to be certain i had watch the actual movie the film isnt just as good as people say it is the only reason i gave a 310 rating is because of the leads emma stone and partially ryan gosling these two actors are very talented but even that couldnt bring this bland story to life and the ending lets not even get started there the movie all in all is a complete waste of time,happy
if you asked me to describe in one word that word would be overrated the actors are great but the story line is so boring i had to google the plot of the movie after i was done just to be certain i had downloaded the right movie i only gave it a 310 because the leads emma stone and ryan gosling tried the best they could to bring the bland story to life perfect thats why they won so many awards from it acting such a movie needs lot of talent,happy
this movie is the worst movie we have ever seen in our entire lives people of all ages will be crushed with this movies ending i am so very disappointed with this movie and my fellow associate cried this ending not only leaves us upset but extremely dissatisfied if you are looking for a movie that crushes your dreams this is the movie for you the notebook was better and they fucking died as far as romance goes i would like if it was more similar to that at the start of this movie i had depression at the end i wanted to fucking die end game this movie sucks and i would highly recommend to give the director a sucker punch i cri evrtim watch the notebook,happy
ive always enjoyed musicals i would not classify lala land as a musical yes theres music and dancing but it seems disjointed somehow in this one ive always enjoyed emma stone and ryan gosling in a number of their films they were okay in this as far as acting singing was a little disappointing not great singers so many great modern musicals but sorry to say i cannot classify this one as one of them,happy
boring as could be nothing really happens the music sucks i like lots of films even some terrible ones but this is the biggest let down ever i honestly think that people are being deluded en mass just because this has some sentiment about classic aspects of art it doesnt excuse the fact the there is no story,happy
is a wonderful musical movie that tells the story of mia played by emma stone and sebastian played by ryan gosling and how they follow their dreams while also falling for one another this movie reminded me of the musicals i saw when i was little since i havent watched one in years and why these kind of movies are so lovely the performances are on spot and of high quality really gave me the sense of realism also the soundtrack is marvelous with songs like city of stars a lovely night another day of sun or the fools who dream the cinematography was a delight so many wonderful pictures and the mood that they were shot on gave the movie more realism as if it didnt have enough already the story was good but sometimes felt a little bit sudden and this is my only issue with the movie there were some scenes that just happened without some good context to them and i was like ok how did we get here but it didnt bothered me so much so that it could ruin the experience i had with this movie also there moments in which i was like this is gonna happen next buy again it didnt bothered me or made me feel i was wathing a predictable movie the execution was what made me enjoy it even though some scenes were predictable there was even some comic relief in it but it never seemed forced or in there just for the sake of being in there like most of the recent marvel movies there is a scene at the end that will make most people cry no spoilers here i almost did and it was so surprising to see this type of scene done like it was done here in a musical movie but it worked wonderfully to enhance the heart that this movie hadoverall a wonderfull movie that i longed to see it for quite some time now since it won 6 oscars this year i would highly recommend it to musical movie lovers and to anyone who wants to watch a movie with good story and good acting by both the leading actors 1010,happy
i had to write this review as so many musical purists are completely missing the point im fed up of reading that the lead actors cant sing or dance and that that makes it a bad film this is nonsensical as this film is an evolution of the musical not a musical made in the 50s i would argue that most of the classic musical greats contain awful and hammy acting which do not resonate with a contemporary audience and do not make them bad films by having actors perform a musical in a real and raw way is what drew people in and made the film relatable we look at emma stone dancing on the screen and think i could do that to judge this film on the actors singing and dancing is missing the point  just as some did with les miserables the beauty of this film is the drama humour and romance created by talented actors acting their socks off ok apart from ryan gosling who looks like he could tap dance through a terror attack and i mean that as a compliment the musical numbers are endearing and are tools used by the director to make you feel for the characters not as a recording for an album i can normally find a small fault with even the best films but i could not for which is why i have given it a 10 needless to say the cinematography is gorgeous while the costume design has inspired me to make an appointment with my tailor lastly the ending reflects the authenticity of the performances by being based in reality ironic considering the location of the movie and again relatable interestingly i watched this film at a specific time of my life and it reminded me that there is not just one route to a happy life that is what i took away from oh and that i want to be ryan gosling,happy
ive come here to write a preview and my feelings while watching this movie some people might not like this movie and they be like its a musical movie so lame it doesnt deserve any award or something like that well id like to say yes its musical and yes its about love story but this love story doesnt lame and it shows us how real lifes love story looks like the music and the lines are beautiful and again some people dont think so because musical movie is not their type the meaning is so beautiful at the end of the movie well see realitys love the fact that we have to choose between love and our passions and how young when we fall in love with someone i recommend you to watch but if you dont like musical or allergic to this type then you shouldnt watch it the imdb of this movie is not low but that doesnt mean everyone can enjoy it,happy
damien chazelles is a new age musical with many throwbacks to the classic films by gene kelly the ending leaves the audience feeling content and sad at the same time for both the characters and allows for the viewer to interpret what it means to be happy to do something you love or be with someone you love the movies overall feeling is joyful yet grounded in reality the speed was fast paced but slacks a bit in the middle felling like it was dragging on the movie has many references to classical musicals which should provide great entertainment for anyone familiar with the films by gene kelly the camera movement and use of colors and music to illustrate emotion was nothing short of stellar for example in the end of the movie sebastian is bathed in yellow light while mias face is covered in a blue lighting while the background was a dark green showed that for them to fit into the world they needed to change the path they were on because together they both made the color green and made their way into the world but apart from each other another simple thing that illustrated change in character was the 360degree spin around mia during her successful audition showing her divergence from the path she was already on the music also played a key part during mias revelation of what her life could have been with sebastian playing the same tune that they both met chazelles commitment to classical filming techniques truly made this movie a joy to watch that evoked far more emotion than any other film of that year the twist at the end really gives a certain tone to the movie that the world isnt a fairy tale and you need to sacrifice other parts of your life to succeed in another,happy
is a movie by damien chazelle which brings back together with old musicals like singin in the rain broadway melody shall we dance and much more overall it is a movie about movies the whole movie plot is about potential but struggling actress mia who thought that she can be an actor because her aunt showed her some casablanca posters when she was younger and jazz pianist sebastian who is currently stuck with the idea of bringing back the glory of jazz like before the beginning of the movie took my breath away even though i am not a big fan of the musicals but that bridge scene was stunning later the whole plot of the movie was about following struggling lives of actors until their paths came across and then guess what they fall in love nothing to be surprised for later they started to support each other towards their life dreams until mia dumps sebastian because he was going for guaranteed success instead of opening jazz bar mia went home to her parents and giving up on her dream to become actress until sebastian comes and saves the day by persuading mia to go to this promising audition and then something happened that i didnt even expect to happen they both went separate ways until they met again in future mia as successful actress with family and sebastian with this dream achieved to open successful jazz bar that scene was interesting because i didnt even expect it and it kept the dose of reality it was a happy ending but not as usually one this film had some interesting moments from technical  shooting aspect the cinematography is good and the movie is visually perfect but what can you expect from the movie with more than 30 million dollars budget i really liked that the movie was shot in the way that somehow it reminds you of old days because of the visuals you could say that it is only because of the usage of modern technologies like iphone new cards etc it is obvious that is modern age this movie includes one interesting scene that can be referenced as slight return of mise en scne scene where mia and sebastian were on their first date there were in cinema watching rebel without a cause the situation between them were starting to get bit more serious until the screen goes black because of technical issues and then everything stops the lighting and colors were playing a huge roll in the movie colors were crucial in displaying the current emotions the blue color was used a lot it surrounded mia few times for example the moment when sebastian had the first concert with a bend she also had a blue dress at the party and the city was shining blue after she left the party the yellow played a huge role because it symbolized the change ahead like the moment when mia and sebastian danced after party mias dress was yellow and before that they were in not so friendly relation but after the dance they looked like more than some friends also the moment when they were on dinner they both were bathed in yellow color while the background was green in the end that scene resulted with the possible break up i really liked the moment where they shot the 360degree scene with mia singing the song it looked like she is alone in her own universe telling the tale about her struggling to reach the stars from the analytical aspect the movie is decent but i have expected more the story was so basic that even clichs had clichs even though i was really surprised by ending it caught me off guard there was that dose of reality trough whole movie that i really liked,happy
im not particularly into musicals but when done well they can probe into an area of enjoyment that regular films dont bother withthis movie does not do that not at all its almost as if some amateur theatre troupe discovered a suitcase of money and decided to spend it on their lifes dream hiring some hollywood heavies to shineup their bgrade overworked musical romp the movie looks good it moves nicely editing is fine all the hallmarks of money spent getting pros to do professional worknone of it saves the cringeworthy opening the unexpected and unexplained changes in personality of the characters nor the general feeling of algorithmdriven movie construction insert jazzy swing number herestarts out musicalheavy singing and singletake popping its way through several muffled numbers until after about 20 mins i began to start forming the words in my head this movie isnt for me honey im going to go do something elseclearly someone with contacts had conned their good friends in the media to spread the word pure awesome clean fun had been condensed into a twohour chocolate bar but the lyrics were machinegunned out the songs boiled out like coke poured onto hot concrete and every side character looked like they were trying to over perform with their 2 minutes screen timebut i stuck with it and held a sort of scrunched face grimace on my dial through stone and gosling dancydancing their way around an la hilltop look ma they teached me to dance good check it out fools weve got chemistry listen to the foot scrapes and our nearsynchronisation i know next to nothing about dancing but it reeked of averageskilled people trying really hard to emulate things theyve been taught like the way you feel when a pictureperfect cgi character starts awkwardly moving their lips like an uncanny valley of dance instructionthen abruptly the musical push fades goslings character stops being a douche and emma stone becomes 3d and then i actually started to enjoy myself ok so we find out very late in the piece that she already has a boyfriend but what the heck hes a bighaired vain suit and she evidently cant stop thinking about the permanently squinting unshaven skinny white jazz enthusiast who opened with road rage but captured her heart with a bit of careful stalkingit gets almost good  im nonconvinced of stones character ever having a chance of making it but goslings pianistwitholdschoolvalues almost starts to work the john legend bit works their early love worksthen insert here wellmeaning love gesture that ends in an epic argument back to algorithms he sells out she criticises him for not following his dream he understandably gets upset says unreasonably dumb things its immediately nonreconcilable he puts on a kevin federline outfit and does a photo shoot missing emmas oneshot fragile heart output to an audience of 10 wait are they here onedimensional friends in the crowd gee guys were have you been she breaks up runs off home he goes back to being a douche no wait her show was a success one of the ten was a powerhitter they invite her to audition and she adlibs a song under the notes emulate anne hathaway the movie falls awayat times i quite liked it the ending is fine but there are huge holes all through the middle and for me almost all the song and dance parts just dont work like so many people have said get properly skilled people to do this not wellknown actors who try really hard whilst ultimately failingnot the worst movie ive seen the 1star reviews are excessively harsh but anyone who rates this a 10 has for me been fooled by the media and awards hype,happy
i am not a big fan of modern musical films so i was not expecting it to be a great or worst the film opened with a song that i was not happy because i did not like the verse or the music and again to say the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme unless it is a fantasy or an indian film the best part of the film was those song fades away as the film progresses but i kind of liked the dramastory part and the climax track with the quick flashback kind of till that scene i was considering it an average film but that one scene changed my stance so now i think it is a good film but winning 6 oscars i dont know it deserved thatyes the director is known for making music and musical film but he has not made many hes young and so his career yep i loved whiplash one of my all time favourite if that film had won 10 oscars i would have not surprised at all after that flick the people were anticipating to exceed that success in this film as it was received no doubt for those people it was a different flick but not for me especially if you watch lots of indian films by the way the film characters were nice and so the story but not the songsgosling and stone were performed well the chemistry between them was great the narration was going decently until the end which reminded me vinnaithaandi varuvaaya ending that i was not happy about yet something different than usual sometimes i am okay with clich than this kind of conclusion just to bring a change in storytelling overall an enjoyable film most people would love it some like me would say it is a decent flick but theres always a few who would never favour it yet worth a watch710,happy
this is definitely not a movie that i would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why i thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch however my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so i got it as it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end i was enjoying the movie a lot more than she didthis movie is pretty much a quite classical hollywood musical with a non too original story nice music and dancing in addition the cinematography is simply excellent this is the strong point of this movie the rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really really good the scene pictured on the movie poster were mia and sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except mias bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautifuleverything else about this movie isokay okay acting okay story etc as i wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic i am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey different tastes and all thati cannot make up my mind about ending on one hand i am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on on the other hand i have to commend the writerdirector for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit differenti did feel that a part of the movie was missing though i would have liked to see the parts where mia and sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the storyanyway i enjoyed the movie more than i thought i would,happy
im not really sure why got both critical acclaim as well as a pretty good turnout at the box office maybe its because hollywood musicals are a rare thing these days so it seemed fresh and original to people its not really a bad movie i admit the photography is first rate the lead actors are likable and some of the direction of the musical numbers is eye catching however the songs in these musical numbers while easy on the ears sound pretty much alike for the most part and they are not really memorable youll forget the songs a few hours after watching the movie another problem is that the movie moves at a really slow pace while at first the leisurely pace is refreshing in this era of inyour face and strident movies eventually youll be asking the movie to simply get on with it the movie is best reserved for a time when you want some pleasant background noise and images while doing a task that involves your main focus dont worry about missing any plot points  youll be able to fill in the blanks easily and correctly,happy
the film is impeccable the color processing developed for the occasion gives a remarkable result the soundtrack is sympathetic to who appreciates jazz unfortunately this is not enough to make a good movie the scenario should be up to par this is not the case its boring we leave with an impression of banality of djvu the story is hollow the dialogues are hollow the lyrics of the songs are hollow a vaguely romantic tale on a colorful background its not enough,happy
this is the best movie of the year for me it hit me on every level on every emotion i connect every single way with this movie its so real hurtful but has empowered me to never quit cynicism must die i hate it when people throw away their passion ive been cynical many times in my life and at the same time confused but now its all clear to me theres no turning back i choose my destiny and i have to believe in myself no matter how much pain and suffering i go through i know there will always be hope i know it will truly be worth it in the end even if i meet my end before i ever reach my goal i know that i tried my best this movie is so endearing to me it might be the best movie of all time for me damien chazelle has made a masterpiece with so much craft and passion into it he is truly one of the best directors and writers of this generation lets get into the technical stuff the cinematography gorgeously shot lit and impressive long takes coordination of the choreography was on point i know a lot of people complain that the dancing and song numbers may be mediocre but lets get this straight none of those people are professional dancers they are portrayed as normal people in la so theres no reason for them to be dancing gene kelly level or singing gene kelly level now i may not be too much of a fan of the soundtrack but it works for the movie very well its the scenes you are seeing that connection you with emotional punch and thats what i liked about the silent and long moments in this film it is nerve breaking and powerful the sound editing and mixing was also very good i can see it winning tons of technical oscars my favorite is the editing tom cross has done it again its edited in such a brilliant and interesting way i could never lay my eyes off the film i thought it was perfectly paced in every single way it should definitely win for best editingstory and characters a simple but also though provoking plot about two aspiring artists chasing their goals that are dreams to them when i mean dreams this is where it gets to spoiler territory there are a lot of fantasy and dream sequences that likely never happened through dance and song its what i found so brilliant its not typically a generic musical but a brilliant one that makes sense why there would be dance and musical numbers as i said before this is a damn tragedy and damn it is they end up being cynical but recovered its just that once they find out what couldve been its damn heartbreaking its why people should never be cynical what this movie teaches is never be negative even if you are hurt you have to keep moving and never change your path mia is a sensitive passionate and heart wrenching soul who just wanted to make it as an actress she did but it wasnt the way as she wanted sebastian is a passionate pianist who wants to revive jazz and keep it alive he wants his own club and he does get it but ends being heartbroken two souls that couldve been something greater if they didnt have that dinner argument in the first place emma stone and ryan gosling should both receive oscar nominations they played their characters perfectlyoverall is a masterpiece 1010,happy
how th did this film get an 80 rating i stopped watching even before gosling and stone met its so bland and uninteresting,happy
me and my wife figured it out a movie for hollywood aabout hollywood outsiders will be disappointed,happy
likable characters great choice of music i wish i got to know other characters a bit better the whole movie was about seb an mia and i wish some other character got a bit more screen time especially when you have people like jk simmons as part of the cast personally not a fan of musicals and think this movie would work better if it wasnt a musical but it was an enjoyable two hours,happy
in a sense creating perfect films and perfect relationships is a similar task you just start with the best and then simply keep it up never compromising not a single mistake not a single wrong step in a sense its a technical task follow these rules  and you are bound to succeedhowever simply perfect is just too simple too plain when you come to expect the perfection you start taking it for granted and even the perfect things lose their shine and become kinda dull but how to create something perfect if perfect itself wont cut it the answer is you just have to wing it turning your heart into an antenna and listening to what its telling youdoes just that and technically what it does isnt perfect at all the opening scene is way too cheesy and orchestrated the dissonance between the people and their song is tiny but stingingly apparent and youre already bracing yourself for another hyperhyped ultracolored hymn to itself at that point the films all but a future disappointmentbut the perfect relationships are not a sunny day on a loop  whats more important is being able to make it up for the flaws and turn them into the details youll eventually love as well so after having overplayed the bravado at first the film becomes softer and more delicate not miming its song however perfectly but finding its own voice honest and sincere a voice in which mia and sebastian speak to each other at moments gruff at moments insecure  but ultimately telling the most true story there isright here is where most other participants take the smooth road to an inevitable happy ending and the summer in is sweet and promising enough to deliver just that but will the technically perfect thing be really perfect or even a sunny day could get pale if not the clouds and rain to be its counterpart so the summer is bound to turn into fall and once inevitable the prospect of a happy ending vanishes like a sad pipe smokers dreambut thats when were hooked with no way back from that point on we want to listen to the story no second thoughts no distractions theres only us and the storyteller like children who stopped squabbling and all want to know if the prince eventually finds his fair lady our emotions are already at stake and the elegance with which took them out of our pocket is almost illegal the thief doesnt even conceal himself playing our hearts openly and its tempting to stop playing along and call the police after all the emotional manipulation is indeed a crime even when its so sublimely carried outwell if you still had strength to resist the last shreds of it fall when ms stone takes the lead and its not just her ability to act or sing which was out of question a long time ago its how she takes the razor sharp blade of emotions concealed within the script and pulls it out in one impeccable move like king arthur once did and oh boy dont you just start shivering at that moment so bright she shinesand just after that it becomes really inevitable the mastermind of this brilliant spectacle mr chazelle might be young but when hes behind the wheel of a story he wrote himself he doesnt miss every single romantic nonsense that we used to laugh about  like and she felt as if those five years have never passed as if she was right there in that quiet restaurant at christmas eve her eyes on him as if nothing else existed  becomes alive in his hands and he literally takes us on a journey others could only describe the feeling you experience at that moment its pure magic something that not only makes you forgive the pompous intro but makes you realize that it was the only right start for something that led you where you are now and thats when your feeling is finally completetechnically isnt without a flaw and if i was a grumpy old fart i mightve groaned on about it for a bit about ryan goslings questionable singing or the plots lack of complexity or the ending being not what we might want it to be but that doesnt really matter after all its just technicalities what does matter is what the film emanates  love love for art love for those who dare to dream and dare to follow the dreams who dare to be open and true love for life itself the kind of love that shows the passion of the person whose heart that love flows out of and these feelings dont just show off or simply graze you they reach out to you they are there for youand for letting me take that love as my own thank you,happy
spoiler warning just in caselets get this out of the way first it was a cinematographic masterpiece absolutely the filming and the music and its alist cast were superb i cannot get over the brilliance of how attentively the film has been crafted but the plot was average and unfortunately a little too predictable for my liking whether or not you want to say that its just to be enjoyed or some kind of cynical meta commentary on hollywood and the greater state of affairs doesnt take away from my opinion of the films plot that its merely your average romcom with little real substance sprinkled with shiny stars to give the illusion of magic tacked on with a bittersweet ending and wrapped up in aesthetic cinematography ready for the masses to ooh and ahhh over something thats really not revolutionarythe movie meanders between trying to please the audience and trying to comment on something greater and the plot suffers for itif you want a brilliant albeit mindless cinematographic experience be sure to check this out but dont go into it thinking that its multitude of awards means that it has some kind of interesting unique revolutionary plot it doesntdid i enjoy the movie sure would i watch it again nah,happy
wonderful soundtrack  i was very impressed by this film the actors are awesome and they sing very well the story makes us thinking about what it is the most important in our lives we shouldnt forget our dreams but we shouldnt let go our soulmate a very good production with beautiful music dance and play i loved the costumes too i didnt see the time pass it was a very good experience and my friends loved it too i wont tell you how the end of this film but i can tell that i like it very much because we can imagine some things i was afraid to be disappointed because of the trailer and not at all i recommend you to go to see the film and not wait the dvd because this is a film which deserves to be seen on a big screen with a good sound,happy
similar to the way i felt about 2011s oscar best picture the artist for its love letter portrayal of old hollywood black and white silent film styles is the same with its homage to the 1950s golden age of hollywood musicals vibrant colors and exquisite cinematography makes this film perfect eye candy the opening song and dance sequence to the song another day in the sun sets the tone of the routine of joyful dreams of succeeding in los angeles while stuck in gridlock on the freeway going nowhere fast without establishing any of the characters others songs like someone in the crowd the fools who dream a lovely night and city of stars by justin hurwitz were beautiful and the dancing was impressive throughout it even music without lyrics like mia and sebastian theme  planetarium stood out however the music they chose didnt have much of a jazz feel to it for a film trying to save original jazz while these songs makes the movie seem entertaining to new viewers the dancing and the story felt too old  familiar for me the story about two struggling artists one being actress mia dolan emma stone  the other being an old school jazz musician sebastian wilder ryan gosling felt a little too generic after all i saw similar musicals films like this before in 1951s an american in paris 1952s singing in the rain 1953s the band wagon  1954s a star is born this film even remind me of non 1950s musical films like 1964s paris when it sizzles  1975s the day of the locusts in its style dont get me wrong the movie does have some unique things that set it apart from those films like placing it in a weird 1950s fuel nostalgic present time and using digital effects to make a great musical numbers however the story of sebastian and mia trying to make it in hollywood fell a little short in me maybe because i thought the movie play it really too safe it didnt really have much of an interesting reallife story conflict compare to the others movies nominated that year for best picture its pure romanticism escapism for the most part it doesnt challenge hollywood in any unconventional terms no wonder why hollywood loves this film it praise it without much criticize i think that is one of the problems with this film its wears its location on its sleeve with several standard hollywood house parties several scenes on movie backlots and discussions on movie history and a plethora of struggling artists trying to make it that the other side of americans or the rest of the world cant really relate to it after all the conflict in the film really do seem a bit first world problems while i love that the word euphemism describing a person out of touch with reality i wish the movie would had use that more i would had love to see the movie dealt more with what los angeles life is really like than whats its portray in hollywood something similar to the musical in the heights or rent did for new york city after all modern day los angeles population is mostly made out of very normal people of every culture and creed but rarely any of them is showcase in this film all of the people feature here seem a little fakelooking with their rich and beautiful hollywood lives despite that stone and gosling show strength in their performances even if gosling character seem out of place as the white guy trying to save jazz it probably would have been better if he was played by a black actor despite that gosling was alright even if his character was somewhat of a jerk at times though his own character is indeed flawed sebastian shows refreshing selflessness towards mia putting her dreams and pursuits even above himself and encouraging her all the way mia isnt without her positive attributes either she puts her everything into being a successful good artist the audition scene is heartbreaking overall both of the actors made their characters very likable also their singing was alright even if they still feel a bit rough around the edges at times about their chemistry this is the third time following 2011s crazy stupid love and 2013s gangster squad where ryan gosling and emma stone work together both were able to align with each other once again on every level in this film in the end serve as the antithesis to 2014s whiplash writer and director damien chazelles previous film this is most notable in the two films tones  where whiplash was dark and oppressive with the new york settling this film is a bright sparkling oldfashioned hollywood musical with just a hint of modern cynicism theres even a counterpart in the characters of actor jk simmons going to a mean guy whos a jazz maniac to a mean guy who doesnt want to hear any jazz both films deal with the common theme that many dreamers face how far should people go in pursuing their own passions while risking their own connection toward friends family and relationships in my opinion whiplash shows the dangers a lot better why because i think the five yearsdream sequence ending of this film kinda the message it felt like a copout dont get me wrong i still think this film is worthy of the accolades it is sure to receive however if i had to choose which movie of chazelle told the same story better i have to say whiplash still recommended seeing regardless its a fun movie to watch,happy
one of the years lead contenders for awards season is a memorable and expertly crafted throwback to oldschool hollywood musicals and romance boasting topnotch direction thoughtful handling of characters and exquisite performances from all involved it truly is a remarkable film in many ways and its never anything less that completely charming and entertaining it just might be one of my favorite films of the year and yet i really cannot in good conscience give it a topnotch score because for everything it does right it does have one major flaw that just barely holds it back from perfectionthe film tells a classic tale of romance in the city of angels struggling actress mia emma stone is yearning for her big break in show business and has a series of chanceencounters with the gruff but wellmeaning sebastian ryan gosling a man who is also a dreamer with big goals in life and a obsession with jazz as time passes a very tender and heartfelt romance blossoms between the two which may be threatened when they are both given opportunities to do great things but also things that will make them question their aspirations and their relationship with oneanotherwritten and directed by the phenomenal damien chazelle is a powerhouse when it comes to style production and performance the film is a sortof loving homage to the hollywood of yesteryear and is filled with bright pastel colors and absolutely stunning musical numbers that capture the imagination in a way few films can nowadays from a mindblowing and bombastic singleshot opening dance sequence on an los angeles highway through slow and contemplative sequences of dialog where characters muse about their goals and dreams chazelle is always at the top of his game his sense of flow pacing and tone is just magical and viewing the film really takes you back to the feeling you used to get when you watched the old studio classics of the 30s 40s 50s and 60s his sense of character establishment and development is also something to behold and he crafts his story of romance with a keen feeling of grounded realism and sensitivity phenomenal workthe films stars emma stone and ryan gosling are just magical on screen together and theyre a key part of the puzzle that makes the film so enjoyable not only do they have an infectious and giddy chemistry together but both are also just darned good in their own ways stones wideeyed and innocent optimism is instantly identifiable to anyone whose ever had a dream to do something great and her emotional turmoil as she goes through the ups and downs of show business lets her stretch her chops wonderfully and gosling nicely compliments and contrasts this as a character who wants to do great things but always seems to have to compromise hes a perfect foil to stone and in a weird way they can almost be seen as the same type of character only having gone down different pathsunfortunately i cant help but feel there is one critical flaw that haunts the film and holds it just shy of being a masterpiece and that is the fact that the film is often in love with itself too much to the point it becomes a detriment i know that sounds silly but thats the only way i can describe it theres so much to love in but oftentimes the deeper concepts and themes that are brought up take a backseat to style and reference there will be a wonderful scene where two characters share a deep and meaningful moment only to be followedup with gosling dumping a slew of references to famous jazz musicians or stone having a doe eyed moment where she looks classic la iconography and as a result well it becomes uninteresting and pretentious at a few key moments a film needs to be in love with itself and everyone involved should love the material but it goes a bit too far at times herethat being said i cant help but admit this is probably one of the years best films and this flaw doesnt detract the excellence of virtually every other aspect of the proceedings this is a work of cinematic art and is filled with love and passion from all involved and its just a wonder to behold it just isnt quite perfectand so i give an excellent 9 out of 10 definitely check this one out on the bigscreen it deserves to be seen in theaters,happy
usually musicals are about a boy a girl a bunch of good songs and some dancing i am not a big fan of the genre but i definitely prefer any astairerogers movie than later productions with loud long songs and too much dancing anything with gene kellytherefore i enjoyed it has a very simple plot some pleasant songs among which the great city of stars and most of the dance numbers are not overdone  apart from the first one of coursethe opening scene made me fear for the worst being a bombastic number with amazing acrobatics and many people involved but then boy and girl meet not so cute with some minor roadrage and the show tones down a bit gosling is sebastian a wouldbe jazz pianist and stone is mia a wouldbe actressafter the bumpy start they get together and support each others dream until their professional success becomes the main problem not a groundbreaking plot from poor and happy to rich and famous but not so happy anymore the slightly melancholic ending wraps up the story perfectlyi usually do not like much gosling but he was ok as sebastian and stone is lovely however in too many closeups of her face her eyes and lips look disproportionately huge neither is a great singer but their imperfection is quite endearing they had enough chemistry and their songs and dances were finemy only negative remark is about some corny dialogue both sebastian and mia encourage each other not to care about what people think but to do to what they like as performers they should care a lot about pleasing people lots of artists are out there doing what they like with zero or very little following  and very rightly so because they dont respect the public while integrity is appreciated selfabsorption not so muchi left the cinema feeling better than when entered which lately happens quite rarely maybe it is the hard times or the stress of life but this movie was definitely a pleasant break from reality,happy
ryan gosling proves to be one the most versatile actors working today with his performance in who knew that he could also sing and dance my previous favorite film of his is lars and the real doll in which he plays an oddball who falls in love with a mail order doll and his family and friends to along with his illusions his partner here is emma stone as an aspiring actress who works as a waitress and struggles to survive gosling is a jazz pianist and of course they fall in love as they pursue their dreams the music is good including john legend as a singer and band leader who provides an established star for gosling to work with i am not a fan of the musical genre especially actors singing lines at each other i find the format tedious i was able to overcome my previous prejudices and actually sit back and appreciate the story the ending in not a typically hollywood one so is one of the best movies of 2016,happy
is easily my favorite film of the year for being a daring film with amazing characters a fantastic story great music great cinematography and so much more the film goes through the beats of a typical romance story but evolves into something so much greater that will leave most audience members in shock and awe the film has so much heart that by the time film is over emotions will be rampant as previously mentioned both the way the movie was shot and the musical aspect worked for the movie instead of working against it like what most other musicals seem to do it uses these elements to enhance the plot and keep it going along without a single dull momentif you have yet to see this movie youre missing out on one of the best films of the last decade and i highly recommend you go and watch it as soon as possible,happy
im quickly coming to the conclusion that this years academy award nominations for best picture will be one of the weakest ones in recent memory this film is the third one ive seen among likely nominees the others being manchester by the sea and arrival taking nothing away from this films principals ryan gosling and emma stone i couldnt help thinking that this is the kind of picture i might have gotten a kick out of if i was still in high school it seems geared to adolescent fans of musical drama and academy folks who will be enthralled by the doomed romance aspects of the story leaving a wide range of movie goers in between for whom real life has a lot more to it than dancing away ones road rage on a jammed freewaywith that i dont have too much of a problem with the production aspects of the movie its bright and colorful and theres some gorgeous cinematography at work but it doesnt seem enough id have to say that emma stone does a remarkable job with the range of emotions shes expected to convey im actually a sucker for anyone who can cry at the drop of a dime the way she does here any number of times ryan gosling is not quite her match in that regard but still pretty competent in his role as the conflicted jazz man considering they arent professional dancers the scenes calling for them to strut their stuff are done quite welli thought as well that the frequent griffith observatory scenes were overdone sebastian gosling and mia stone werent rebels without a cause they had inspired goals in mind that they pursued with diligence and patience the ill fated aspect of their romance at the heart of the story will bring a tear to the eye of many viewers but within the context of the story it felt contrived and telegraphed long before the break up actually occurredwith that the film stands at number twenty four on imdbs list of all time rated movies as i write this right between the silence of the lambs and its a wonderful life can anyone explain that it will almost certainly adjust downward as time goes by but its personally frustrating for me to see brand new releases accorded the same stature as films that have stood the test of time over decadesone bright spot though  the scene with miles anderson as the photographer in that bite the lip segment  that was hilarious,happy
for the most part damien chazelles hollywoodbased musical is a truly sumptuous affair full of glorious highlights with a touching romance between stones wannabe actress and goslings jazz pianist at its centre then the words five years later pop up on screen and you realise that it is in fact trying a bit too hard it suddenly appears uncomfortable with its own whimsy thrusting an unnecessary reality upon its audience in the final moments which undermines the joyousness of what has gone before to an audience surely now fully invested in this dazzling couple anything other than a future together is pointless the attempt to marry dancing on top of cars and among the stars with a more modern truth is too awkward a closing montage showing us the more traditional happy ending makes it even worse for the romantics almost suggesting with its chaplinesque routines that any alternative to the proffered conclusion would be ridiculous the brilliance ofs setting soundtrack and performances should not be forgotten its just a shame it decided it needed to carry a message,happy
its been a long time since ive felt so invested in a movie i can go through romance films and like them sure but this one immerses you and makes you feel almost like you are part of it feeling all the emotions i really cant pinpoint what it is exactly but this movie tinkered with my feelings hardcore theres something magical about this movie i can also attest to say that i dont usually like musicals but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and like all the songs admist the theatrical and creative style that carries this film this movie is real what i mean to say is that it resonates even though it may do things that escape the realm of reality i think thats why i love it so much you can relate to all the little feelings and actions these characters do i think they did a good job of setting the tone for this movie by introducing the characters and what theyre passionate about this makes us understand them and root for them its the driving force for the entire film we care about this movie because theyre so passionate about something and it shows them pursue it despite the odds its truly a beautiful admirable and difficult thing to do i think at the end of this film you learn some lessons that are open to interpretation but no matter what it is you do take away something from it ive seen it twice in theaters already and plan on buying it when it comes out on dvd,happy
to start off let it be known that i am not a huge musical guy i can enjoy them i have just found it hard to take them seriously and be able to look past the awkwardness but blew me awaydamien chazelle has dazzled me before with his oscarworthy whiplash and he has done it again the music in this musical kept me interested wanting more anxious to hear the next most musicals i cant wait for the songs to be over to hear the dialogue each piece had character great choreography something else that helps is my love of jazz music and i found most pieces to be jazzy so that earned itself some brownie points the actoractress performances really surprised me when i saw emma stone and ryan gosling starring together in a musical i was somewhat skeptical i knew both were wonderful true professionals at their crafts i just seemed to question the fact they would be doing this role together they nailed it their dialogue between one another really made this musical seem realistic if you will for me and that went a long way in my view of this filmas a whole this film is such a beautiful thing its colorful fun comedic pretty charismatic the music flows with the feel and the emotions of each scene of the movie to a t and i enjoy every tracknow the endingso effing geniuschazelle didnt give us the ending we wanted and we all knew exactly what we wanted the typical love storymusical ending and its not what we got but he didnt just stop there he gave us an alternate ending in the middle of the actual ending and i loved it he gave us a taste of what could have been what we all wanted to happen so bad but then he brought us back to reality it crushed me absolutely crushed me but i loved it so so much i wanted them to be together but as i stated before that wouldnt be quite realistic enough for me sometimes the people we run into may seem perfect just what we need and thats exactly what they are but as this film shows us sometimes we may need those people to be temporary so we can find what we need permanently bravo chazelle910,happy
okay so i hate when people start reviews that way but this is a bit of a take a breath moment and keep it real sometimes in cinema a directorproducerwriter etc will try to reinvent a genre a revival if you like to make something popular again horror has been reinvented for generations as have westerns and periodically musicals unfortunately this movie will not revive the movie musical as pleasant and mostly well meaning as this is after hearing mostly positive reviews i walked into the cinema with warm expectations for a couple of hours of guilty pleasure enjoyment and walked out at the end in silence with the rest of the audience in a  that was quite good  kind of way the story is not all engagingthe songs are not overly memorable and the pacing is fairly pretentious its a musical that is in denial about being a musicali went to see an early run showing of les miserables in an imax cinema when it was released and the movie being applauded at the end because people had a fantastic experience the mostly luke warm experience of this with the occasional vaguely exciting dance number and the expressive quiet of the audience afterwards leaves nothing really left to say except pleasant enough and ultimately forgettable,happy
if you already bored with scifi or unrealistic or heavy movies maybe can be your option this movie is very light and enjoyable to watch what i like from is tell a story about real life how life is a matter of choices and every choice that we made its have a consequences within emma very shinning in this movie her facial expressions so incredible made me laugh and cry with her ryan was so great played the piano they both deserved win golden globes and maybe emma will get her first oscar and for damien i just hope you will make an incredible movies along your career as a director one thing that disappointed me is the scene when mia emma have her flashbackwish the scene like shows a bit regret because they didnt up together which really unnecessary thanks it closing with the smile from both of them accept the faith that they just passed by in each other life but overall its a beautiful movie to watch,happy
i would say i watched this movie because of the sheer hype that had been created for months and also so many nominations and awards pouring towards this movie for a long time nowit is a pure musical and a magical movie and i must say it is absolutely brilliantalthough i am not much of a musical movie fan the strong script stunning acting startling music and perfect dances make this movie a truly modern day classic it has a feel good factor all the time and it brings a breathe of fresh air to this years oscars ryan gosling and emma stone are breathtaking in their characters both might just win their respective oscars this yearalso because of the commercial success of this movie which oscars consider a lot this movie is a story of 2 half the 1st half is all romantic and cheerful how both of them fall in love and work towards their respective goals the 2nd half gets real when success doesnt come cheap and how they start drifting apart the story never deviates from the plotdamien chazelle the director has done an amazing work at no point of time you will feel disconnected the story is gripping as well as radiant at the same time the music is too good you will surely keep on humming the title track for some timetrust me this movie will sweep away with the oscars this year ps movie is too good but its a musical which many people are not used to or do not have a liking towards this kind of cinema,happy
a review of 2016 damien chazellewhen one watches a musical the moviegoer braces himself to watching a story of a where the colors are bright the songs and dances are loud and gayhappy and otherwise and the characters scream their emotions to the screen musicals are usually hammy and fun one ends up leaving the cinema humming a few songs from the film hoping to extend the magic of the musical and make the positivity seep into ones realityis not a moviegoers typical musical the colors are mostly muted most of the songs are not the ones to give you a severe case of lss and the characters emotions are contained subtle even the moviegoer gets out of the cinema not humming but thinking of how this new musical worked despite not following the tried and tested conventions of musicalsi applaud how the director damien chazelle fuses his love for jazz music in this film reminiscent of his earlier fantastic work whiplash the unexpected quirky nature of jazz parallels the turns in the movies narrative elevating this simple musical to its a dizzying profound rich climaxthe performance of both emma stone and ryan gosling are soberly appropriate as if one has seen a jazz concert and the players are too cool to admit that they slew their performance but i have to hand it to emma stone where in one singing scene she stole my heart with the subtle emotions in her face both in cathartic mode and in perfectly melodic tuneadmittedly seems like a shooin for award festivals because it is the kind of movie that hollywood loves it is set in city of stars after all as set in los angeles so yeah wordplay on filmbuffs would rejoice at some references to classics like singin in the rain and casablanca but the casual moviegoers would still be able to identify the reality that the lovers have had to deal withits a classic love story spoiled by practicality it is a classic story of how the dichotomy of appearance and reality interweave and catch up with one another the movie in our head wants the musical but our modern selves also believe that the musical is too ideal too good to be true the last twenty minutes of the movie takes the moviegoer to this dilemma and we ask ourselves if we have become so jaded that we do recognize that the musical has to give way to a saner sadder conclusionafter a long time in we finally have a classic musical that represents our current decade our reality our times though our now is steeped in financial practicality getting in the way of our passions jaded ideals of love and courtship both online and offline there lies within all of us a subtle oftentimes ignored voice that still longs for the music and magic even just to rekindle that sparkor at least to remember how deliciously beautiful our past and dreams were,happy
is one of those pictures as you watch you feel teased with the good times and feel good nature that you hear from the music played during the film as this picture comes off as a pretty good musical drama still its more than that its a movie of hope love romance and having the faith to dream set in sunny los angeles it follows the tale of sebastianryan goslingand miaemma stonewho are both finding life a struggle as sebastian is a down on his luck jazz pianist who seems to get fired gig after gig and mia is an aspiring actress who continues to get turned down audition after audition and really it seems as if no hope is around still thru the bond of friendship and love that the two make in the city of angels hope is within reach and it shows that dreams are possible and stars do come out and shine overall good fairy tale of hopes and dreams coming true involving life and love,happy
thoroughly engaging and moving at the same time i remember being floored by the artist 2011s academy award winning best picture and its still one of my favorites on a similar level celebrates the transporting power of the movies with music and magic that never feels routine rather a heartfelt ode to cinema itselfit isnt just a musical either like the artist before this is a very simple film none of that mind bending stuff but also brutally honest on the harsh and often destructive nature of show biz while the media is always ravenous for hollywood scandals what we dont often see are the painful choices and sacrifices these artists have had to make and for that reason isnt just a device to revive musicals but also a heart wrenching account of what it takes to be successful in show biz kudos to ryan gosling and emma stone not just for their velcrolike chemistry but also for perfecting that colossal irony often expected at the movies  a happy ending that ending segment when we see what could have happened was almost unbearable but its also the director revealing the quintessential soul of this film  and for me it is in a perpetual state of enchanting melancholy,happy
i initially really wanted to see this film on the big screen but as wide release got closer all the rave reviews put me off a bit  was it all hype were the hollywood powersthatbe pushing the reviewers extra hardwell regardless of my doubts i went anyway and i was glad i did this film hearkened back to the song and dance musicals of days gone by but with the added twist of using real actors not professional singers and dancers i felt this added a great deal to the movie  the characters were real people  people that sang and danced well but not perfectly the producers could well have dubbed professional voices ala marni nixon for natalie wood in west side story but not doing so made this film so much more realryan gosling is a very good actor after seeing his work in the film id have to say he is better than good has he made it to the pantheon of great actors im not sure but his performance in was outstanding  he ran the full gamut of emotions and he can do more with a sly glance than many actors with better pedigreesgosling had the perfect partner in emma stone who at times appeared to be channeling audrey hepburn her eyes can evoke more emotion than almost anyone in my opinion she was quite excellentthe film is fun and quite emotional at times  not a full box of tissues but a good handful would be nice to havebut wait  theres more this is somewhat of a musical after all and i found the score to be absolutely perfect unlike most films where the music can be setting a background mood the music in is integral to the plot and the quality of the score raises the film to another levelmy suggestion would be to see this film now on the biggest screen you can find this is not a film for the home tv unless you happen to have a full size hollywood screening room in the basement,happy
i love the way the story was narrated the songs the characters and an awesome ending when i went to watch this movie i really didnt know what to expect as i didnt watch any trailers but heard good things from few friends ryan gosling and emma stone great chemistry and good actingmy favourite song is city of stars which i read has been nominated for best original song and it is a well deserved nominee in my opinion it deserves to win definitely worth watching but be open to a different perspective of the story line as it may not be what you expect,happy
i always wish i saw movies without expectations but we live in a world measured by time so we dont waste it with titles that are subpar nonetheless i came into the theatre expecting an above average romcom i was completely satisfied in many regards i dont even like musicals but this movie changed my mind the choreography was not strained the songs both told an important story and more important sounded good and the chemistry in ryan gosling and emma stones characters was absolutely terrific it makes it hard to digest that these two are not together in real life as i might even dare to say that the chemistry between these two exceeds even the chemistry found between ryan gosling and rachel mcadams in the notebook,happy
i had not seen whiplash or any of the other films director damien chazelle has contributed to so i had no idea what to expect from this film besides from what was in the trailers wow am i glad i watched this movie every scene and every musical number is a beautiful piece of art by themselves but when they are woven together into this little film called they become a masterpiece i barely have any words that can express how much i loved this movie emma stone and ryan gosling are fantastic in it and the music and score compose by justin hurwitz make the film sound and feel like a classic i am so glad i got see this movie in theaters twice because that is how this movie was meant to be seen,happy
there are several scenes in that have no dialogue only a dreamy background score and the actors expressions guide you through the beautiful thing here is that you dont miss the spoken word at all this and many other things make a subliminal watch it is a gorgeous movie full of heart and soul and i loved every minute of itthe film is a musical journey about an aspiring actress and an undervalued jazz musician who meet at a low point in their lives and keep running into each other until sparks fly the story traces their life as they find themselves and pursue their dreams whilst falling in love the musical genre isnt my favorite odd i know since i adore indian movies but this isnt just about the song and dance routine though thats an integral part of the film the movie starts with rush hour in la and people from all walks of life sing their way through the chaos this first number sets a tone thats rare for movies nowadays joy however the movie isnt all happy the characters grow face rejection fight but interestingly the mood is never bleak its charm is infectious and leaves you wanting to tap your feetemma stone and ryan gosling and perfectly cast as mia and sebastian ms stone delights as a struggling actress whose eyes speak volumes and who can make the most trivial of activities seem noteworthy at the risk of sounding too cheesy she is the heart while mr gosling is the soul of this gorgeous masterpiece he is charming without arrogance he is funny slightly broken and good a lethal combination both complement each other marvelously and the chemistry theyve built over the years can almost be touchedthere are ample songs in the narrative of course and they are enough to whet the palate without leaving you feeling burdened the singing isnt perfect but we cant expect our actors to do everything flawlessly the choreography and the ease with which the characters dance is applaudable as the seasons change you notice brilliantly executed shifts in our leads without ever losing the essence of the movie theres a fine screenplay at work here bravo damien chazelle your vision is glorious watch this film youll find ample reasons to love it i left the theatre feeling a little giddy with a smile on face what more could i ask forhttpsstuffiwatchblogwordpresscom20170105lalaland,happy
damien chazelles last movie whiplash was my favorite movie of 2014 so i was really looking forward to what he would bring to the table this time around especially since it is such a different feel and genre than whiplashblew me away it took me on a journey like very few films have ever done from the time the opening starts to when the credits rolled i had a smile on my face it one was of the best experiences ive had in the theaters in my entire life and musicals are my least favorite genre of movies after seeing this movie a week ago i still cant get the music out of my head ryan gosling and emma stone are brilliant in this film their chemistry is top notch and they play off each other incredibly oscar buzz for these two is well deserved as a matter of fact oscar buzz on just about every single part of this movie is well deserved acting cinematography costume design the score everything is top notch even my dad who absolutely hates musicals after the film said i could not keep a smile off my facethe film is incredible if you havent seen it please go out and do so this is by far in my opinion the best movie of the year and deserves all the hype its getting 1010,happy
emma stone angelically sings heres to the ones who dream in a showcase moment in emma stone and ryan gosling are enchanting director and writer damien chazelles musical is an ode to the dreamers and to passionately pursuing your dreams i love is an amazing love story bitter sweet and resoundingly poignant it made me happy touched my heart i did not expect this from an old school movie musical director chazelle lyrically outs this with the opening number as performers sing and dance atop their cars stranded in traffic on a los angeles freeway in cosmic synchronicity lovers sebastian gosling and mia stone meet when one flips the other the bird yes only in los angeles in the days of astaire and rogers musicals used to cast gifted singers and dancers who could act has gifted actors stone and gosling who can sing and dance this resonates for because it is eloquently about the choices we make in life and the possibilities as stone smiles on a bench at the griffith park observatory she is sublimeboth joyous and sad gosling speaks with such soulful conviction to stone about jazz being always new even by narrative design as they burst into song or dance stone and gosling ground with touching authenticity the compromises they sacrifice for their dreams i read that stone and gosling both trained rigorously for months for their roles gosling also displays mastery at the piano their performances are among the years best so is stone is mia an aspiring actress and fulltime barista at a coffee shop on a hollywood studio lot gosling is sebastian a jazz pianist working at restaurant and jazz bar who dreams of one day opening his own club they meet a couple times before they get the universes message they share their dreams mia is frustrated with audition failures and is at heart a writer and wonderful storyteller sebastian yearns to make jazz vital and alive for people sebastian is estranged from successful bandmate keith very cool john legend love arises for mia and sebastian in the movie theater in rialto director chazelle literally transforms gently holding hands into a dazzling dance amidst the stars the dancing and music in are astonishing the dancing is particularly moving with stone and gosling they have that magical chemistry the songs by composer justin hurwitz and lyricists benj pasek and justin paul are catchy with a few that are memorable although hurwitzs final musical composition is wondrous life happens for mia and sebastian filled with joy and heartbreak and through it all is love mia says im always gonna love you emma stone allows us to see her soul through her eyes her performance is amazing stone is beautiful and is luminescent on screen gosling is so classically handsome and he disarms with his fearless vulnerability stone and gosling are such soulful actors and are the heart of dreams give life with them we surrender to love and what happens will be so made me happy touches and inspires,happy
i am a huge fan of broadway and musicals in general and one day i was in the theater seeing a movie and the promo for came on the screen it immediately caught my attention and just based on the promo i knew it was going to be a good movie i have now seen the movie twice it is so good the soundtrack for this movie is a piece of art i have been listening to the music for days now and i am not tired of it its just so catchy the movie is visually stunning as well the shots of sunsets and cityscapes are just breath taking emma stone and ryan gosling as mia and sebastian the two main characters are so talented and truly amazing actors dancers and singers proves that they are definitely triple threats overall i enjoyed this movie so much they really dont make a lot of movies like this one anymore if you have not seen it yet make sure you do you wont regret it,happy
a lot of major cities have a lot of hidden history the majority of it can be found in books and the internet but there are some things right in front of you take a city like los angeles that has plenty of history with hollywood and the impact that its made on the film industry buy a map to the starts and youll probably be able to find the chinese theater paramount studios and the brown derby hat what a lot of those maps dont show is that many elements from hollywoods heyday are still around like certain theaters homes and even murals you just have to look for themtodays film pays plenty of tributes old hollywood is just a part of that is like a wave of nostalgic feeling from a time where musicals were part of the movie going season and i mean an original musical whens the last time that you remember a musical that was not based off of a broadway play not counting animated movies its been a while and to sell one in todays time it would have to offer something weve havent seen before brings back the original musical mia played by emma stone is an aspiring actress who works as a barista for an on studio coffee shop the few auditions shes given are either stopped after one line or interrupted by someone who clearly feels more important then her at the same time jazz musician sebastian played by ryan gosling is having problems with money and trying to get work thatll allow him to play the improvisational music that he prefers a gig at a restaurant only allows him to play christmas music but he tries his hand at a beautiful melody that doesnt catch the eye of a lot of people it does so of mia who happened to discover it by chancethe two are initially not introduced that evening but they encounter reach other months later at a party the two strike up a friendship which ranges from sebastian taking her to a jazz bar to curve her interest in the genre to a screening of rebel without a cause this eventually blooms into a romance as the two move in together and continue to chase the hollywood dreams of making a mark within the world of entertainment ill say right off the back that is one of the best most entertaining movies of 2016 i expect this to be a major hit with everyone even those that dont typically watch musicals this is a rare musical where i can recall all the songs being great city of stars another day of sun and start a fire are all candidates for the best song oscar director damien chazelle whiplash clearly loves older music as jazz is given a bigger spotlight here then before the tunes plays by ryan gosling and john legend who also plays a part in the story are just delightfulis also one of the best made movies of the year it takes several cues from martin scorsese as many of the scenes especially the musical sequences are done with long takes this made me realize just how too often modernmusicals rely on editing to make the shooting easier shows the hard work the actors went through to make each step and tap flawless when editing is present it pays homage to movies of the 1950s how does it do that i really dont want to give anything awayill give this ten old hollywood murals out of ten if 2016 has brought down your spirits then will bring them back up i highly recommend this to everyone this is a fantastic work of art that justifies much of the hidden history and beauty our world holds to us dance your way to a screening of this and sing a long if you wish,happy
theres always 2 or 3 movies a year that are considered amazing 1010 or perfect but it ends up being just really good or average but not perfect well that doesnt apply toi drove 30 minutes out of town to catch this at a theater since it was the closest place showing it near me in the state and it was beyond worth it admittedly i wasnt completely sold during the first 4 minutes even though it was perfectly filmed and choreographed but once this film takes off into the story line and characters lives i fell completely in love emma stone and ryan gosling have amazing believable chemistry obviously theyre able to play off each other so well and make their characters feel very authentic and theyre more than up for the task of dancing singing and having great timing with the hilarious jokes that make this the most enjoyable experience all year for me also emma stone hasnt been better shes the stronger of the two with being able to cross the line between determined and desperate for a career that you almost couldnt tell if it wasnt for the way her eyes water and seem as if they have their own hands trying to reach for success and her performance of dreamers is one of the best movie musical performances ever since anne hathaways i dreamed a dreamdamien chazelle the director created his masterpiece and this is only his third film after whiplash which i honestly wasnt a big fan of but this time him and his team gave birth to a vibrant precise and endlessly fun movie thats able to show the struggle of wanting to follow your passion paired with the best camera work ever and great music hes able to breathe life into jazz and the movie musical while saying they were never dead in the first place everything in this film jumps off of the screen and fills you with joy needless to say chazelle and ryan goslings next film together about neil armstrong in space already has me excited seeing how the the space scene in this movie killed me and brought me to life at the same timei could say about 3 paragraphs more but ill shut up long story short is everything its made out to be and more its definitely 1 of 2 of my top favorite movies of the year and im glad this was the last one i saw in a theater in 2016 please go and watch this if you can,happy
is a true masterpiece from the second the movie started to the very end my foot was tapping the acting in the movie is spot on if you like musicals then i think you will love it was such a clever movie the music was brilliant especially city of stars this toe tapping masterpiece will be a new classic for years and years to come i really enjoyed itparents is rated pg13 for language but there was not that much language in it well there was one f word and two middle fingers but that was it if your kids love musicals then they will fall in love with ryan gosling and emma stone were absolutely incredible even john legend for his first time acting he was unbelievable this whole movie had great acting thanks for reading hope you enjoymy score 1010,happy
going to see this movie the third time such an excellent blend of music colors emotions and ambition worth seeing multiple times and every time i found something new the attention to detail and careful expressions made me connect to the characters tears were filling up yet hope was rising at the same time love the rhythm of the plots where there is a great combination of active and slow songs leading my feelings to a roller coaster the colors are absolutely stunning the outfits and various of sets give an impression of old hollywood with a touch of youth and summer i admire the characters as they have dreams and passion maybe we were all considered as fools once on our way to the dream to keep being true to ourselves or follow the trends to gain or to lose each decision may lead to a direction more importantly i can literally see the sparkles between the main characters absolutely my favourite of the year,happy
i really wanted to love and i really really liked it but i didnt love it it was a beautiful film but left a lot to be desired in the writing department as a screenwriter myself the clich way sebastian and mia meet and banter left a lot to be desired they dont actually get together until what feels like halfway through the movie im sure theres a lot of people out there who love the journey im not one of them even my friend next to me said just kiss already i cant say the rest of my problems with the film without spoiling it so ill just say the dinner scene made no sense thankfully for damian the dancing and singing was just enough to distract from plot holes the musical numbers were fantastic and ultimately this kind of escapist film is just what we need in this day and age it definitely lives up to its hype even if the ending doesnt leave you as uplifted as you expected to asking in on the bright side the audition song is a beautifully moving one that leaves you in tears if its not performed and doesnt win an oscar it will be a major upset,happy

this is the dream its conflict and its compromise and its very very exciting sebastian ryan gosling sebastian a jazz pianist with ambitions to start his own club in la pretty much sums up the thematic heft of a contemporary musical that evokes the golden age of hollywood together with mia emma stone who aspires to be an actress and playwright the two embody the dreams of young people then and now crystallized in fred astaire and ginger rogers with gene kelly thrown in for good measurethe opening musical number sets the joyous mood by breaking into song and dance during one of the monumental la traffic delays on 405 its choreographed with eye opening color and mirth an appropriate antidote to las notorious torture chamber however all is not sunny hollywood for the dramatic arc takes us through the difficult times this radiant couple must endure while pursuing love in a loveless landthis joy and sorrow is directed by whiplashs brilliant directorwriter damien chazelle whose devotion to the spirit of 40s and 50s hollywood dream factory is matched by his willingness to portray its vicissitudes and not end just the way you would have expected the integrity of this film lies in his showing the power of ambition and the unwavering sacrifice to fulfill itbesides chazelle the success of this winner lies at the feet of stone and gosling whose song and dance are not perfect all the better but so romantic that it is hard to believe they are not professional musical actors and maybe more to the point not romantically involved yes their chemistry is that goodhas already received wide acclaim and rightfully so it refreshes the musical genre of old hollywood and it reminds us we are such stuff as dreams are made on,happy

ill give this movie a 10 to me it deserves that much the movie has everything sure the musical aspect of the movie will not appeal to most people after all when people think musical its either les miserable grease or disney films however is so much more it is about having dreams of performing  about hope and of course about love ryan gosling plays sebastian who cant afford to pay his rent because he cant find a stable gig he dreams of opening his own jazz bar and he has such a passion for jazz that you start to love jazz too jazz is dying and he is on a crusade to save it emma stone on the other hand plays mia who is an aspiring actress however she fails all of her auditions miserably they meet and fall in love and the rest goes like how love stories goes except with singing and dancing ryan gosling is one of my favourite actors so it definitely helps that he is playing the lead role and as he is also a good singer it seems a perfect fit emma stone on first impression seems like a different role than she normally gets but she pulls it off perfectly the chemistry that these two have on previous movies together can also be seen here the movie definitely has class the musical scores and the songs especially the jazz to be honest some of the musical scene might get a little bit draggy but thats only for the 40 mins when youre getting used to having a song sung by the actors after every new scene it mellows down afterwards and gets bit more serious i love the pace of the movie because you get to know the characters and feel their motivation of why they love performing and why they choose to act or play jazz i left the movie charmed by it it is a definite mustsee not for everyone to be honest but personally its up there with the notebook,happy
i basically went for this movie because i didnt want to watch rogue one i felt like ive had too much of star wars and marvel comic movies i think i made a wonderful decision because i get to see lifes irony presented in a very beautiful way incredibly talented actors my favorite singer john legend has a role in this movie all of them are singers and dancers and belongs to as a musician and lover of dance i felt like this is what i was looking for action movies and the protagonists struggles seems to have been defeated by pure love romance and lifes irony incredibly beautiful experience i would call it not at all an average romantic musical it shows how music brings our souls to life and then all that jazz,happy

so this turned out to be a good oneryan gosling and emma stone are two people who find each other in the craziness of the perfect star cross lovers situation as gosling plays a jazz musician dreaming of opening a pure jazz club and stone is an actress just trying to get a part and their brief encounter turns into a love affair not really that big of a fan of musicals just the idea that at any moment the cast can break out into song and dance i just find a little annoyingbut i really liked the production design of its just so beautiful and gives off everything that youd find in golden age hollywoodthe art direction was made to look glamorous to show off the magic of the photography gave homage to the movies of yesteryearthe story was perfectly basic something you seen many times before which was used to enhanced the beauty of how the story was told and the cast ryan gosling and emma stone did a descent job trying to be fred and ginger the two have chemistry gosling was my favorite out of the two i think ive only seen him do really intense stuff so it threw me off watching him do comedy but the offset only made it funnieras a musical it works for me overall i found one or two songs classical but the rest was more of an overall feeling no single song steps out as much as everything works so well together to enhance telling the storyfilmed by the guy who made whiplashhas a small role for jk simmons who won an oscar for his role in that film i still like whiplash far better but this was a great follow uphttpcinemagardenscom,happy
lets make america great again and this is his kind of movie this is a film directed at wasp who long for the times of the racial segregation syruped with a touch of fantasy land where everything is clean colorful safe prosperous rich neat and without the least concern everything ready so that the characters impeccable model of a wasp overcome small obstacles to achieve their dream life black people negroes only exist as a bearable cargo and are a mere accessory there are no colored people of any kind nor any race the only latino person spic who only appears to the end is an acceptable accident the rest is only white for racist wasp who miss the old southern white times and for whom the rest of humanity does not exist except to abuse it by waging war and then we know the rest white men and women of the last century who have always lived longing for the world of white fantasy that some rulers of the contemporary america have promised them that someday will come it is a shameful that the academy have given oscars to this type of film,happy
i still remember the day i saw it it was december 22 2016 the day of releasemonths ago i read about a new comedy romance and musical movie that promised to be incredible with the headline a jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in los angeles i did not understand how such a story could be even good then came the trailer the trailer was great and it began my intrigue of how everything that came out in the trailer could appear in the same film i listened to the soundtrack i fell in love with the soundtrack and then i finally saw itit was the first time in my life that i left the cinema full of joy and nostalgia but happy because this art exists happy because there are people who give everything to tell us stories in this way i know damien chazelle will never read this but i want to thank him a lot for la landyears ago i thought about suicide for certain reasons im still here and i remember very much thanking all the people who had to do with this film because they made me feel grateful to be alive and have the opportunity to have been part of such a beautiful storyperhaps many believe that the film is not the big thing it is understandable this world is full of tastes and people and we are all different in them but this time this movie made me feel good about me made me sing dance and dream it shows that it was made with a lot of love and that is why i write thisthe production design is fascinating the music is beautiful the cinematography is perfect and the acting is very outstandingi know i will remember this movie all my life,happy
i work in a small cinema and the first time i saw a bit of i was leaving after 2 minutes im usually not a big fan of musicals so the first scene was already enough for me at this point 1 week later i was in a situation where i had to watch the movie so i though i might as well give it a chance starting with someone in the crowd i slowly fell in love with the movie and as mia  sebastians theme first came up i fell completely for this movie i dont even know where to begin the perfect music the wonderful actors i was just hoping no one would talk to me because i surely wasnt able to talk with all those tears in my eyes this has never happened to me before you can totally lose yourself in this beautiful movie from this day on i was using every single chance to see the movie again and againchanged the way i look at things i feel way more open for unknown things this movie is pure creativity and it well deserves all the awards,happy
is a brilliant film from the most talented young director working today damien chazelle the film is about mia an actress who never gets the role emma stone plays mia and the is just brilliant in the film she sings she dance she acts all in the same breathsebastian played by the genius ryan gosling is a pianist who loves jazz he wants to start his own club so he can play jazz there mia and sebastian who you see slowly falling for each otherbut the best thing is if you see it for yourself it is worth watching so what are you waiting for go and watch it right now because everything in this movie is beautiful and perfecti love,happy
from the opening to the end was amazing with beautiful cinematography moving story everybody can relate to and surprise and heartbreaking ending i laughed and cried this movie is like a dreamscape i would watch this movie again and again and enjoy its artistry and story the opening scene on highway was one of the greatest ever im disappointed that it didnt win oscar best picture but its just an award show with peoples agenda in choosing which movie should win will be an hollywood classic for many many years,happy
was without a doubt one of my favorite movies i have seen in a long while the score is outstanding i am still listening to it and attempting to learn it on the piano toward the end it takes an unexpected twist keeping the audience engaged since it takes this unexpected twist some of the audiences first reactions can be that they do not like the movie after watching the whole thing and getting attached to the characters however 10 out of 10 would definitely recommend,happy
this this right here is what i love about movies this film right here is why i put myself through going pretty much every weekend to see the latest critically acclaimed masterpiece that turns out to flop in the hopes that one day this will happen is beautiful soaring fun uplifting dramatic gorgeous and basically everything that makes us smile i was grinning throughout the entire first act this is an original live action musical something we dont get to see too often in movies today could it have been a bit of a missed opportunity to cast two white actors in a movie about jazz yes it could have been but emma stone and ryan gosling shone on their own they are both bright stars but put them together and they light up the world chemistry which is such a big missed ball in hollywood these days is undeniable between the two of them it just worked i cannot praise the soundtrack enough the songs are brilliant and catchy and bright im still listening to it months after seeing the film also the choreography and costumes and the aesthetic of it all the musical scenes are filmed with such fluidity it is magnificent the movie is given a retro feeling but takes place in modern times the color palette of bright primary colors for stones character and more muted browns and blues for gosling worked perfectly with the themes and their relationship the ending as abrupt as it may be was certainly beautiful and no one can say it was unsatisfactory,happy
remember the name damien chazelle writer and director aged 32 without a doubt he is upstaging those in the industry for decades if he builds on this momentum his reach will certainly be endless he is 2 for 2 with whiplash and its way too soon to stack him up there with the allens and scoreceses but without a doubt chazelle is now noteworthythis original screenplay and direction is as inspirational as its beautiful its mellow yet potent its tranquil and flamboyant its a motion picture but theatrical in its essence the simplest of stories unfolded in the most enchanting of ways the theatrical approach the balance between the new and revolutionary whilst preserving a semblance of tradition the last i recall being this engrossed in a movie of this genre is with moulin rougenominated for 14 academy awards tying the record of titanic and all about eve is story of love a jazz pianist ryan gosling and an actress emma stone find their lives intertwined in a struggle of finding themselves and love gosling isnt new at toying with emotions he does so with a strange aura of simplicity surrounding his performance its ethereal stone is almost as good as she was in her role in birdman both characters are built blandly from ground which makes it a challenge for the actors its magical what gosling and stone do with itappreciating is a test losing interest isnt arduous musicals are not for everyone considering the initial half hour of the movie and its slow start this title necessitates patience further its a work of art holistically the mesmerizing soundtrack the vibrant set the acute direction and the impeccable acting eventually makes it all worth you whileverdictlet your self wander into the world of a must watch a masterpiecetitle directed by damien chazelle starring ryan gosling  emma stone rated pg13 rating 0910 runtime 120 minutes,happy
okay couple of things to get out of the wayyes the unlikely attraction story is clichd as hell yes its another musical with sporadic choreography and musical numbers yes there are elements that look like any old musical weve seenall that aside this film is just beautiful the music the cinematography the set pieces and most of all the chemistry between gosling and stone it really strikes a chord to anyone who is passionate about the arts the constant struggle of a musician or thespian is captured brilliantly here and the team behind this film deserve every ounce of credititll be very interesting to see how many of the nominated awards this film will receive,happy
why was nominated for 14 oscars tying the most noms ever it invokes the fantasies and feelings of many past musicals and numerous film romances from its opening scene i found myself noticing the nods to other films because of story or style including fame dirty dancing moulin rouge the way we were invitation to the dance an american in paris funny face a star is born a chorus line and especially one from the heartcoppolas musical instudio masterpiece of camera techniquesit is easy to understand its popularity in hollywood its views on acting as a profession are very relatable for actorsryan gosling and emma stone play the romantic leads and are credible singers and dancers gosling even plays the keyboards for his partmandy moore so you think you can dance provides the choreography including duets for the two stars that are reminiscent of astaires workgosling plays a jazz musician so the films soundtrack has a jazzinfused sensibility that reminded me of swing out sisters breakout two of the songs written by the hurwitzpasek  paul team are nominated for oscars one won the golden globe though personally i prefer the otherwill win all 14 nominations no but it has a shot at as many as 9 for those who love romantic films wellmade it is a joy to experience the ending of the film provides a surprise twist that expounds on the films conception of life and love as cinematic experience,happy
is a musical and it is a fact that the current movie audience is different from the audience in the 50s who loved musicals even the great movies like dancing in the rain and an american in paris where gene kelly dances are not being watched by the new generation who has grown up listening to this rock and other modern music some peoples initially say that the period of musical films has passed this film does not do business but apparently the viewer liked this film however is opening with a stage where the people who stuck in the traffic starts to dance with joyful drums playing jazz rhythm which also catches the audience it is said that after people watch the movie they return home with a happier better and higher mood but in the on the background is not only classic jazz but a rhythmdominated popular music and jazzblended musical genre surrounds a broader audience unlike past musicals dance and music alone are not enough it is a solid production in the dramatic direction for example the characters dialogues are very strong it can respond to the expectations of the younger but more intellectual audience of today director damien chazell stated that his favorite films were the umbrellas of cherburg 1964 directed by jaques demy actress catherine deneuvechazell is a very young director and writer we remember him from the film whiplash which he wrote and directed again in 2013 cinematographers remember that movie with a drummer who struggles in the hands of a tyrannical music instructor the director seems to have a mission to make people love jazz music and this new film continues to progress from that trackthe main players are emma stone and ryan gosling ryan goslings biography is pretty full emma stone entered the cinema with her 2010 film easy a though the filmography is not yet rich it seems likely to win the oscar with the perfect game in so we are almost witnessing the birth of a real star as if it were in the same movie role as this production j k simmons who plays the role of bullying trainer in whiplash is surprised by a small role boss who does not understand the musicits about the impossible love of sebastian who wants to play refined jazz but forced to play music that he dislikes in ordinary places and mia an ambitious cafe cashier who wants to be a player the american dream is brutal whether you want to pursue a career or climb to the fame even the bonds of love are as weak as cotton yarn i recommend that the audience pay particular attention to the final scene its as if referring to the final scene of the unforgettable casablanca movie,happy
i am not so into musical but when i knew that its nominated for more than 14 oscars then its a must see movie will capture you from the beginning cause its a love story from a perspective of both lead characters where you will never get boredits a very classical approach to filmmaking where characters express there feelings by singing and at the same time using the light to focus on a character inner feelings i loved the chemistry between ryan gosling  emma stone its magical one of the greatest romance movies of its time with a message that will keep you thinking about i recommend new couples old couples or even singles to go and watch these piece of art love is just like jazz it could evolve or get old but it will never vanishes and its definitely a best picture oscar winner,happy
i have always seen myself as an atheist in terms of musical genre i simply have not believed in the genre i have considered it to be extinct painfully melodramatic pathetic exaggerated yes the list of negative words associated with musicals goes on  but then i saw and now im a believerthe film is a punch in the face on several levels it is a liberating punch in the face against my cynical intellectual and rational calculating side to paraphrase sebastian one of the films characters the word romance should not be used in a bad sentence  and this film made me regain confidence in the romancethe film is also a punch in the face regarding all technical elements such as photo scenery costumes music etc pure enjoyment the scene when the camera linus sandgren jumps into the pool to the accompaniment of music and dance is brilliant finally the film is also a punch in the face in terms of the emotional journey the audience goes through i must say that the end is ingenious spoiler alert first the director chazelle reminds the viewer of the deep sweet love then he strengthens the love and just when we think the love story has reached its climax then we got a stab chazelle stabs us right in the heart ingeniously bittersweetwithout this ending the film would not be as emotional as it is the bittersweet is more emotionally and physically tangible than the sweet and sentimental james cameron used this recipe in titanic and it became a big win and i think will receive the same fate,happy
rhode island born damien chazelle graduated from harvard university with a degree in visual and environmental studies he has captured the attention of audiences throughout the country with is own story which he also directed   and likely will become a hollywood staple perhaps the chaotic mess in which we find ourselves daily sinking into a dark hole created by our change in political face is the reason this little slight escape piece is finding such favor or maybe we just want to remember the happy ever after ending to dreams that were abundant in early musical films that makes this film the talk of the oscars and making so much moneythe film is about dreams  their illusions consequences and rewards mia emma stone an aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and sebastian ryan gosling a jazz musician scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apartapart from stone and gosling dancing and singing their way through the endless colorscapes of los angeles and hollywood there are few other actors involved  jk simmons damon gupton john legend tom everett scott and others  to make the plot have any broad strokes but it is what it is  and it is being applauded as the probable best picture of the year go figure,happy
friday is date night and tonight it was my turn to pick the picture to mrs shullivans surprise i picked the musical normally i would have picked a comedy or a good thriller but we both wanted to see why there were so many mixed reactions to this feature film it seemed to be a 5050 split between loved it and hated it with us two shullivans we were not on the fence we both loved itokay so neither star ryan gosling or emma stone can sing or dance very well but that was some of the charm emanating from and this will certainly be a memorable romanticmusical film for decades to come i dont rely on determining the quality of a film based on how many academy award nominations andor wins a film may be awarded because as far as the awards shows go most are just for the pompous farts who produce their own films and they do not like to share significant awards at all thus we never see any comedies or actionthrillers even receiving award nominations just some really big box office revenues so who needs awards shows when you have everyday critics like imdb viewers who provide realistic feedback sometimes good sometimes badwhat mrs shullivan and i liked most was the latter half of the film as jazz pianist sebastian ryan gosling and wannabe actress mia emma stone resolved their personal issues with each other and they bonded as livein partners in support of each others dreams of course in any relationship there are highs and lows and sebastian and mia certainly had their share of ups and let downs we loved the bright rich diverse colors of all the actors and dancers costumes as well as the rich hue of the hollywood california landscapes that writerdirector damien chazelle integrated into many of the song and dance numbers the cinematography was brilliant during the song and dance numbers performed by all of the cast especially ryan and emmas significant song and dance number that is displayed as the films cover art this scene takes place just after sebastian and mia leave a party together as they first get to know each other a little bit better than just as acquaintances as i said maybe ryan and emma are not classically trained singersdancers but how many of us normal couples fell in love while listening to great music and shaking the old hips ala one two three isnt that what makes romance such a magical experiencei do not want to give away the ending but i will say that this musical has some unexpected twists and turns that in my humble opinion make this what will be considered a classic musicalromance in the following decades that hopeless romantics like mrs shullivan and i will want to see a couple of times in their lifetime maybe even with their teenage grandchildren who will also fall in love with for many generations to comethis film covers sebastian and mias relationship as it evolves over all four seasons and then some with new musical numbers that include songs by the world class musician john legend some old style 1950s big dance numbers with vibrant costumes and reminiscent of martha and the vandellas who would in 1983 sing they would be dancing in the streets literally there is no mixed feelings about this film for mrs shullivan and i we dont care how many academy awards wins or loses all you really need to know is that we loved the film yes it will eventually be rated as a classic musicalromance film and yes i am giving it a five star rating a perfect 10 for 10 score we simply just loved it from the beginning and especially through to the ending,happy
after whiplash which is a masterpiece of its own comes another one of damien chazelle both mesmerizing and hypnoticthat movie can make you laugh cry feel sorry for them but happy and the same time its something in a whole new level achieved by not so many movies ryan gosling and emma stone are simply wonderful funny with passion about their dreams never giving upit gives us a beautiful story of never letting your dreams go always chase them and youll see theyll come true even at the expense of big sacrificeseven better was to have the opportunity to choose the end either the real one or the fake one that makes us happierit will surely be around for the next years as a unique and wonderful movie destined to be a huge classic seen by grandchildren everywheredefinitely recommend,happy
city of stars are you shining just for memia an aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and sebastian a jazz musician scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apartbefore i dive into the film id like to say that i stick to my no spoiler style and that this is a really biased review taking into account that my partner and i are both actors dreaming and planning to move to the city of stars therefore you can guess how i felt aboutmixes perfectly the nostalgia of the golden age of hollywood musicals with an old story wannabe artist move to los angeles thinking she is going to make it dreams crush has to work doing something she is not passionate aboutthis could have led us nowhere but this is where damien chazelle succeeds he knows exactly what he is talking about if youve seen whiplash you get an idea of where this guy is coming from some of his themes are repeated here jazz perfection dreams about succeeding on what you love difficult choices love or giving your 100 to what you lovemia and seb  emma stone and ryan gosling are two unique creatures lucky enough to find each other two dreamers two of a kind that we recognize i cant think of any other actors that could have done this job better than gosling and stone both have this quality that makes us believe whatever the do theyre not acting theyre living and breathing these characters their chemistry is great it looks like if one is about to fall the other is ready for the rescue and we want them so badly to love each other and make us dream with themthe score is a triumph  justin hurwitz youre a fantastic composer every song is moving and heartfelt which is very rare these days where everything feels too much in your face the music becomes another character in the film taking us into a journey where we feel as the characters hopeful passionate discourage but always willing to carry on with the showand all that jazz im devoted to jazz since i was a child and i saw the talent of mr ripley since then ive been obsessed by it and as seb i dont understand people who dont like it jazz contributes on creating rhythm  is like life improvise stop wait carry on listen play solo go with the band and this is how feelslast but not least j k simmons is there anything not to love about this man doesnt matter how much on screen time he gets he is pure magic and has a wonderful moment that i wont spoilt but it really puts a smile on your faceas i said this review is totally biased i still feel that the fourteen oscar nominations are well deserved and this a must watch for 2017 and one of the best musicals ive seen in ages thank you mr chazelle i thought people didnt make movies like this these daysheres to the ones who dream,happy
this is truly a magical movie sometimes quite literally when the male lead discovers that he can lift the young woman in the air and then go soaring after her like woody allen and goldie hawn in everybody says i love you sometimes just with their wonderful dancing on earth especially with the fantasy sequencesi am sure others have already praised ms stones and especially mr goslings acting singing and dancing he in particular has a charm and outright athleticism when he dances that made their scenes together wonderfulwhat i wanted to add was that this movie often made me think of jacques demys early musical the young girls of rochefort 1967 you get the same sudden dance numbers set on banal city streets  and here even on the freeway  with apparently normal individuals who turn out to be marvelous athletic dancers characters burst into song in a granted unrealistic but still very natural way often wearing outfits of one solid bright pastel color at least for the womenif you enjoyed this movie  and why would you not  you might want to check out demys earlier work,happy
the first minute of the movie you feel that the camera is moving like it does in a normal horror movies final destination but astonishingly the movement of the camera continues to be so smooth until the end of the movie simply you get the feeling that you are a part of the movie as if you are inside the story as for the music i really cant explain the amount of emotions you get during the different moments of the characters the flashback that was used in different occasions was very subtle especially the last scene of the movie where we see the unexpected reunion between the two main characters i say reunion only from the abstract point of view as sebastian started recalling all the main incidents that happened between him and mia but the flashback was very different for this scene as he started thinking about the what if this was a real more than heartbreaking moment and a perfect ending for this moviein fact this last flashback wasnt only going in sebastians mind but also inside mias mind in a nutshell the movie is full of emotions acting skills and nice music for the real lovers of jazz for me the camera was the main character of this movie when you go to the cinema just try to relax and leave yourself to the story line and you will enjoy a lot,happy
well there you go three things i really hate 1 musicals with the exception of grease and rhps 2 clichs 3 whistling given that i expected to hate this movie but wanted to give it tis dues strictly because of the amount of nominations it received yes it had cheesy singing i dont think you can have a musical without cheesiness yes it stole from other classics but it did it on purpose with meaning and while paying homage so i give it props for that it was respectful of jazz as a genre and i respected the movie for it the overall story was clichd but delivered with conviction and i found myself with a cheesy grin on my face for a good chunk of the movie and certainly didnt expect to shed a tear shut up there was something in my eye would i watch it again probably not but would i recommend it yes,happy
this movie is not some glitzy rehumanization of being rich during the depression its actually almost the opposite a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business one an actress the other a jazz pianistdamien chazelle has dazzled me before most musicals i cant wait for the songs to be over to hear the dialogue each piece had character great choreography something else that helps is my love of jazz music and i found most pieces to be jazzy so that earned itself some points this movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that its not worth picking a few just go see it even if you dont like musicals it will win you over,happy
damien chazelle loves music jazz music to be more precise a quick peruse through his imdb credits shows that writerdirector chazelle made one of my favourite films of 2015 in the brilliant whiplash an intense study of a young music college student who longs to be a great drummer and the maniacal music mentor who drives him to the brink whiplash soundtrack is an ode to jazz with classic jazz staples played throughoutfor his followup film chazelle once again shows his great affection for jazz a very different film in every other aspect is an extraordinary film whilst still showing a clint eastwoodesque level of love for jazzmia emma stone is an aspiring actress working as a barista in la as well as working she is caught up in the souldestroying circus of audition attending that is the lot of actors everywhere sebastian ryan gosling is a pianist a jazz pianist he can play other things but he only wants to play jazz much to his own detriment he dreams of opening a nightclub where likeminded individuals can come and eat chicken and listen to jazzmia and sebastian first meet briefly on the la freeway where a tailgating sebastian angrily sounds his horn at the inert mia as she sits it the traffic learning lines for an audition they cross paths again when having had her car towed after a night out mia wanders into a bar and is captivated by the piano player sebastian when she goes to compliment him on his playing he brushes past her ignoring her completely their next meeting is at a party where sebastian is working as part of an eighties tribute act playing the keyboard when leaving the party sebastian saves mia from a boring writer and their relationship flourishes on the walk to her careverything is great until they realise that their individual dreams will ultimately take them away from one another so it proves when sebastian decides to shelve his dream of pure jazz and a nightclub to join an old friend keiths john legend modern jazz band thus beginning a life of touring meanwhile encouraged by sebastian mia writes a onewoman stage show that flops on the opening night crushed by its failure and disappointed that sebastian could not be there for the show she leaves town and goes to her parentssebastian receives a call from an agent looking for mia he goes and finds her and tells she must do the audition the audition is successful but the job entails going to paris mia takes the job five years pass mia is a star sebastian has a nightclub they are no longer togetherthat is the bare bones of the story but is so much more than that for one thing it is a musical i am not a big fan of modern musicals i love the classics west side story sound of music seven brides for seven brothers my fair lady singing in the rain and so many more those fifties and sixties technicolored extravaganzas that had characters burst into song for no reason other than it seemed right too is that kind of musical from the opening number i was hookedunlike some modern musicals penchant for singing every line goes the tried and trusted route of songs interspersing with the story the songs enhance the story maybe not the dance routines so much but the energy and commitment of gosling and stone make even the musical indulgences a pleasureneither actor is what you would term a singer but their ability to carry a tune is more than adequate in the film both singing  and dancing  their parts happily as if veteran stage performers they also really work as a screen couple which i feel is down to stones innate doeeyed femininityeven though it was the strong character of olive in easy a that brought emma stone to worldwide attention as an actor she has not felt the need it seems to take on feminist icon roles her roles to date being a mixture of lead and supporting lead parts gosling does gosling that is not a criticism in this film as the jazz classics obsessed sebastian it absolutely works his cool detachment and suppressed emotion contrast with his total passion for the music the connection that is jazz you believe that he lives for the musicthe film is also a bit of an la travelogue making the watcher yearn to visit la colours are crisp and bright city visages clear and inviting the greatest compliment i can pay this film is that i am not sure i can ever visit los angeles to find out that it is not actually like chazelles would be a massive disappointment you may never go to los angeles but you should definitely go see beautiful,happy

in the age of countless romantic films lacking originality and falling victim to tiresome formula damien chazelle the intelligent mind behind the exhilarating musictheme drama whiplash in 2014 makes a return to the directors seat to deliver arguably one of the most sensational romantic tales in recent years crafted in a style of an old romantic filmnoir from the 1950s through slick editing and vibrant storytelling this film shines with the powerful cinematic appeal of actress emma stone and supporting actor ryan gosling both of whom blossom on screen in a romance that not only feels original it almost magical in every sense it is sweet its sexy and most importantly vastly unpredictable and if the cast performances and sensational musical numbers tightly grips your attention damien chazelle also has a sweet appetite for visual storytelling an aspect this film greatly embraces set in modern day los angeles this follows mia played by emma stone a struggling actress who crosses paths with a passionate jazz pianist sebastian played by ryan gosling as the two bond and a boiling romance develops between them their separate careers grow further and further in the entertainment industry which puts a rift on their relationshipdamien chazelle effectively breathes life into the romance genre operating on both narrative and technical elements have been abandoned since the golden age of hollywood back in the 50s opening up with a vibrant musical number on a crowded highway this film mixes elements of classic musicals with a gripping love story that gracefully comes to life on both a narrative and visual scope the pinnacle to the film is a love story between two individuals of different backgrounds who grow further and further in love and before too long are progressively drawn into each others remarkable world and rather driving the story on overbearing melancholy chazelle proceeds the story through a sense a humanity and spirit without feeling the need to rely on redundant formula to add icing on the cake the film expresses a sense of spirit and sensation through a series of musical numbers that are not only evoke nostalgia of classic 50s musicals but play out very provocatively during these scenes we are introduced to both ryan gosling and emma stones surprising singing abilities arguably very few knew theyve processed and these scenes blossom with beautiful cinematography by linus sandgren of david o russells joy and american hustle who strives to not only capture the energy of these of the duos lively performances but also the colorful palette of nighttime los angeles and the characters outfitsemma stone and ryan goslings are both the apex of the picture and explode on screen with performances that can only be described as mesmerizing and even that sounds like an understatement emma stone who rose to oscar territory with her performance in the oscarwinning picture birdman shines her light with charm and vibrancy in her role and the biggest surprise comes not only from her ability to drown herself in a dramatic characterization but also with her lively singing ability which she displays on screen a good number of sequences downtoearth and swarming with humanity stone breathes life into her character working along her side is costar ryan goslings who steps in the shoes with her romantic partner sebastian a jazz musician with a passion to igniting a future for jazz music and disillusioned by the fading light the classic music genre has evolved in americas culture when he crosses paths with emma stones mia he almost desperately tries to his artful world upon learning of her lack of appeal in the classic style of music his performance along with his singing ability is a thing of beauty and by far the most enthralling performance hes ever ignited in this career the chemistry these two share is brought by damien chazelles engrossing direction which renders their romantic spark simply irresistible even during long periods without them on screen together the romance between these characters never feels contrived or hokey but thoroughly uncompromisingis an electrifying romantic masterpiece swelling with vibrant performances by emma stone and ryan gosling and best of all boasts an outstanding directorial exertion from damien chazelle furthermore it ignites life into a dimming romantic genre in a stunning conclusion takes a soft spot as one of the best films of 2016,happy

following two falling stars in their fields and how their relationship grows getting to high then dropping down and finally giving a view on their success bravery by damien in trying to bring us back to era of musicals and dance movies followed with a hugely dramatic plot which torn down lives of our sebastian and mia but amplified their love by ton sebastian is a jazz pianist that goes through rough times as jazz is dying and he is a great lover of jazz but unfortunately his dreams of opening jazz bar are dying every day more and more mia as actress struggles to find role and get her chance in proving to be worthy of acting but after meeting sebastian they challenge each other but never stop loving each other as movie goes so their connection is lost but that doesnt stop them from dreaming and that is what this movie tries to be movie for dreamers and how they must never stop dreaming in turnout of events mia gets a job of screenwriter and must leave everything behind which felt real hard on both of them now many years later their lives will come together and it was absolutely magnificent and filled with emotions as well as love for each other when they were together they couldnt manage to accomplish anything but when they got separated they got everything including their love for each other as they see how happy they are but arent together and that was a great touch on the end ryan gosling as sebastian and emma stone as mia are both incredible with their very emotional and charming performances damien chazelle did a spectacular job in directing and originality of the movie music for movie just stands out from everything else and considering it is a musical it should 44,happy
i went to see yesterday 1312017 and i am in love i cant believe how long the uk has waited for this movie one of my favourite scenes is where they dance together for the first time on the hill after the party they get closer to kiss and the phone goes off i love how its got a golden days of hollywood feel to everything but its set in the modern day where phones exist and its just a classic moment that would happen in old films that was subsequently and humorously ruined by a phone what i loved about this movie was how it was like a dream unfolding in front of mei think weve been waiting a few years to see a musical as glorious as this its fresh new and yet its reminiscent it invites you in and quite honestly i would say this film applies to not just people wanting to be actresses or own a jazz club but everyone whos going out there and dreaming and its almost a moral of keep on dreaming make your dreams a reality yes its a jazzed haha pun up view of the world and the real world isnt as rosy and sweet but it can if you believe in it not even joking even in the first song i was nearly crying tears of joy because of how happy bright and amazing it was im such a wimp city of stars made me tremble with goosebumps and also proper tears the end was made sadder by the audience silently whimpering as well but i just love love love every feeling and emotions you get from it how its so bright and beautiful and the cinematography had me im an avid enthusiast of nicely shot camera angles colours and gradients and there wasnt a camera shot i didnt like everything workedi wish and would quite happily talk about this movie for hours but im yet to find someone in my life who has watched it or love it as much as i do,happy

the atmosphere they found so many different inspiring places in los angelesi never really knew that there are so many different forms of atmosphere in this city they used perfectly colors and lightning to create a nice and sweet area that really warmed my heart make up and costumes were very authentically chosen and made me feel like it was real the use of camera and the sound are very good but average good emma stone this girl can sing i didnt think after easy a she can hit a noted but she really has a sweet voice and in the right moments it turns out to be very powerful and energetic she has a perfect and very high range of emotions and can express these very good this role will push her many steps up on the ladder ryan gosling he has a great voice too i like his acting very much and i think he gave his best but at some parts i believe he was weaker than emma but still a magical performance the cast many talented actors in there but you dont really recognize them because the two lead actors are always more or less alone in the focus they made their job good but hadnt enough time to develop the story the only weak thing in here is that you dont really understand how they fall in love this is too short explained the rest is awesome they seem very happy while chasing their dreams and their love and then it turns and they nearly caught their dreams but these dreams collide with the love i think this is a clever story and what you see on screen is perfectly worked out at the end when they decided to have own lives without each other to achieve their dreams and they look at each other and see how their life could have been if they stayed together i cried so hard and this is the point you laugh you cry you are happy and you are sad all this in one package the music i love the songs they stuck in my head just one second after they finished an they didnt leave i am not a musician but i love these arrangements i will buy these soundtrack best scenes 1 opening 2 a lovely night 3 audition fools who dream 4 epiloguethis is the best musical i ever saw and one of the best movies i ever saw it deserves every good review and every award i will be live and see this rule the oscars,happy
this review of is spoiler free  55 a modern hollywood film about the glitz and glam of hollywood with an addition of pure unadulterated joy is in very short supply in this crazy sometimes nonsensical world both on and off the big screen this is the short reason why the irresistible is so cherishable today its just as light on its feet as fred astaire and just as beautiful as judy garland sure enough whiplash was very intense especially with jk simmons terrance fletcher screaming thats not my fking tempo every so often and throwing a chair at miles tellers head is a little more bittersweet than that in its first half its footloose not footloose and fancy free buoyed by the catchy soundtrack such as city of stars which definitely deserves some awards recognition thanks to the production team for coming up with thatits part new york new york part the umbrellas of cherbourg with a little bit of singin in the rain we can just imagine the sweet singing voice and quick footed dance moves of gene kelly running the streets of modern day la though its a biggerbudgeted upgrade over writerdirector damien chazelles short guy and madeline on a park bench with more or less the same idea the story is mia emma stone an aspiring actress trying to make her life in hollywood who soon learns that if you dont make it the place will eat you up whole and use your bones as a toothpick she meets with seb ryan gosling a jazz pianist trying to become a famous musician its an incredible part of the story which is the definition of simplicity and initially as soon as the pair meets the chemistry is electric as sparks fly in every place both literally and figuratively whether they are singing to a jazz track or dancing on a hilltop to a technicolour backdrop they are unfathomably a match made in heaven and almost inseparableat one point the two are walking through the modern streets of la seb is talking about his chances as a jazz musician suddenly mia states that she hates jazz so he teaches her that it is everything with his irresistible dance moves or playing aha on a keytar she learns to like his taste in music a bit more when she gets the chance to star in a onewoman play the tension becomes unbearable between the two and they decide to go their separate ways mias and sebs career takes off on a high the two become famous and their life starts to go in different directions unfortunately there isnt much of a story which falls horribly flat in places due to some sadly misplaced pulp fictionesque narration techniques but with the sound track the dance moves and the electricity of the stage the message is clear that doesnt need much of a story despite the story falling flat in places their chemistry is electric the music is terrifically catchy the dancing is irresistible and the awardscalibre performances keep the film on a high will make you sing dance and cheer if there is a musical you watch in 2017 make sure its this oneverdict fast paced very funny audacious and beautiful hollywood doesnt make this kind of film anymore truly an instant classic with a lot of heart its the best movie of 2017 so far1010 stunning,happy
is a pinch of hearttouching reality draped in a croissant of sweet fantasy with a flavor of jazz and the 60s the film reaches deep as it explores the intensity and authenticity of ones pursuit of dreams etching them in a technicolorish yet surrealistic canvas however it blurts out a squeeze of reality that chasing ones dreams no matter how authentic they seem may not be the perfect path to happiness dreams after all are visions of what we havent yet achieved they rarely take us places where we already are blessedthe film surrounds an idyllic relationship between a jazz pianist and a wannabe actress which derives fuel from the individual passions of one another gosling is great in his typical shyaway from lens yet intense scorpioish style but emma is stupendous her charm and vividness is the heart and soul of this film the chemistry is bangon and exudes undercurrents of bleak and innocent adolescence the cinematographer has exploited the moods of viewers with exuberant use of colors the hilltop dance sequence vividly reminds of singin in the rain and shall definitely be remembered as a classic in the years to comesome realists may find it a tad too frivolous with frills ribbons and unicorns but dreamers prepare for a beautiful ride the best of 2016 periodp s jk simmons still scares the crap outta me please keep him away from musical things,happy
a bold statement i admit when you have to size it up against west side story and singin in the rain but from the first bar of another day of sun  a huge busby berkeleyesque number  that erupts on the gridlocked freeways of la you know you are actually in heaventhe two central characters mia and sebastian are introduced at its finale and we set off on a love story like no other are there even any other actors in the film ill have to look next time oh yes john legend completely taking the mickey out of himself tip your hat to him for that well its like the umbrellas of cherbourg actually but better so so much betterthere are only actually 7 songs in it so its quite an unmusical musical and neither ryan gosling nor emma stone can really properly sing but thats beside the pointwriter and director damian chazelle whiplash  another magical movie about jazz subverts the musical genre by having almost no music in the third and fourth acts but it doesnt matter because now he has a story to tell emma stone is nothing short of mesmerising those eyes that cinematography those costumesryan gosling a fault free cinema superstar he rises eloquently and handsomely to the occasionbut even though they are both brilliant this is damian chazelles movie he has the mark of a master with his direction and storytellingit even has tap dancing i wont spoil it for you by sharing the full storyline as i knew nothing of it before i went to see it but i confess i was worried about the hype and the knowledge that the leads cant sing there was no need to worry and you shouldnt either because this movie is about the unique vision of damian chazelle he is clearly a scholar of big studio big budget musicals and has used the power of whiplashs success to create a dream that noone has been allowed to tamper with its a deconstruction and reconstruction of everything that makes great musicals great but with the twist outlined abovecity of stars has already picked up a golden globe and rightly so but its not even the best song in the movie its difficult to go much further without spoilers so ill leave it at that probably the best musical movie ever made i led the applause and went to buy a ticket for the showing immediately after the one id seen but circumstances prevented me from watching it back to back ill have to wait until later this week when it opens properlyput it this way im now extremely jealous of the 99 of the worlds population who have yet to see and i beseech you to follow my actionsa straight 1010 no question,happy
when i first saw the trailer for this movie i thought this was going to be a cheesy musical with dancing and singing but in reality this movie was a celebration of the fools who dream the music was fantastic and the choreography was on point i was impressed with the whole plot of the story and the amount of drama the romance between stone and gosling was definitely fantastic and they did fantastic in this movie well done to the cast on such a great production and here is to the fools who dream also this movie is nominated for many golden globes and it would be great to see this take some home i also enjoyed the intro and the ending music because it matched with the movie well done,happy
now the awards season is here the hype is a soprano a on this movie musical however the first half hits some flat notes before rising to a soaring crescendo and this was the problem for me in viewingi wanted to praise this movie so much more than i did i love the previous work of all involved and whilst they are all sublime yet again the first half seemed all a little too conceptual and made it hard to invest in the narrativehowever it is in the last 30 minutes this film is bangon perfect and the chemistry between the two leads really landspart of what spoiled the movie for me were the previews too many of the dazzling scenes were revealed and i wasnt surprised enough by the story or execution as i would have been if they had played their cards a little closer to their chestsmay well sweep the award season and i wouldnt begrudge the film if it does so i just so wanted it to be the classic many others purport it to be,happy
musicals are a rare breed in cinemaland these days once every so often a big budget effort chicago les mis into the woods comes along to remind us they do still exist but even these films dont do much to entice newcomers to the genre now i dont know if will succeed where others have failed and prove to be the birth of a musical reconnaissance but if any movie can achieve it this is definitely the one vibrant funny and superbly shot this tongueincheek throwback to the upbeat musicals of gene kelly and fred astaire is a toetapping delight from the ambitious highwayset opening number all the way to the closing whatcouldhavebeen sequence following up after the phenomenal whiplash writerdirector damien chazelle has definitively announced his arrival into hollywood the combination of flair and technical mastery in which he executes each diverse set piece is astounding the song and dance numbers continually build on the story  a struggling actress and a budding jazz pianist juggle life love and their lofty dreams  whilst always bringing something fresh both visually and musically whether its an 80s parody dance sequence or a soulful jazz interlude director of photography linus sandgren must be given his due praise too the camerawork is both enterprising and stylish the frequent unbroken tracking shots adding another level of pizazz to the proceedings yet for all of the wonder and awe brought by chazelle and his crew the film still requires a headlining duo capable of providing an emotional core that can match the song and dance fireworks step up emma stone and ryan gosling in their third movie opposite each other after crazy stupid love and gangster squad the ridiculously talented acting pair not only boast a sizzling chemistry on screen but also get to show off their dancing and singing skills that much to the normal persons ire are obviously brilliant more accessible to the average moviegoer than many previous modern musicals is a triumphant convergence of music dance and aweinspiring cinema,happy
i grew up on musicals my mother the pragmatic working professional that she is would often take the time to instill in me a love for good music good food and good movies i called her the night i saw i called her to tell her i loved her and thanked her for raising meis about as thematically distinct to my sentiments as you can get its the seemingly simple story of two struggling neophytes turned lovers pursuing their dreams in the glimmering monolith that is los angeles mia stone is an aspiring actress whose constant auditions and casting calls have landed her a parttime job at a studio coffee shop sebastian gosling on the other hand is a talented pianist who cant seem to keep regular gigs due to his insistence that his work has some semblance of purity they meet  they fall in love  and over the course of a year they conflict compromise excite motivate and adore each other for the messes they aredirector damien chazelle initially studied to become a jazz drummer in his youth thats a biographical detail that makes a lot of sense when viewing his sophomore directorial effort whiplash 2014 which was one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the last decade what translates to other than a love of jazz is a sense of timing the score the cinematography the choreography all simmer and pop with lively syncopation the visual references are quick to recall young girls of rochefort 1967 but the timing  the timing is pure delirious montage filmmakingas our two stars ryan gosling and emma stone are an organic recreation of the quintessential hollywood coupling they shared the screen only twice before making crazy stupid love 2011 into the underrated romantic classic that it is and making gangster squad 2013 watchable here however the story the characterizations indeed the very frames the film rests on are made lovingly for them any boy do they ever runaway with this film both ooze pure starlight from their pores and ally ever so perfectly withs master thesisand what iss master thesis well in an interview with the guardian chazelle briefly spoke about the struggle of being an artist and reconciling your dreams with the need to be human wanting to create something in he vogue of a golden age hollywood musical chazelle stated that he wanted something more grounded in reality it is that central tension that drives the plot in and does so in new and surprising ways with both mia and sebastian struggling to plug in the expectations of others into their artistic mission both are motivated to compromise both are willing to commit and we as the audience cherish the idea theyll find their way in the endmore than being a feast for the eye and a virtual smorgasbord of visual homages is a film for the heart a crowded theater cannot help but erupt in in laughter tears and applause when faced with a film spirited enough to be sincere its all even more awe inspiring when you consider the camera stops and fauns over real singing real dancing and real piano playing on the part of mr goslingis a delight  a wonder a superb and significant film that has the moxie to fill any heart with joy and the originality to make it all stick much like my own mother is audacious in its ability to capture the imagination with a poise and class that simply cannot be matched it left me with a renewed sense of hope and a song in my heart and heres to hoping it does the same for you,happy
it is a great loss to modern cinema that the most escapist of all film genres the hollywood broadway musical has been presumed buried for decades born in an era of world wars and depression the musical was the most effective happy pill ever invented only in the musical could you find the unbridled eruption of emotion expressed through spontaneous song and dance with scant regard for narrative or dialogue and even less for everyday reality closely related to the fantasy genre the hollywood musical has resurfaced in modern hybrids but the traditional form exists only in libraries and memories that is until you see 2016the opening scenes are a perfect example of old fashioned musical showbiz driven entirely by spectacle rather than logic high on a los angeles freeway a young woman jumps out of her trafficjammed car and bursts into song and dance she is copied by scores of other motorists all gyrating in sync filmed from above in a single take a boy and a girl make eye contact not in a nice way and this is where the story begins mia emma stone spends her days humiliated by repeatedly missing out on auditions for her big chance in hollywood while sebastian ryan gosling is a surly dreamer who wants to open a jazz club for people who love jazz its not a good start for romance but a predawn song and dance routine  a la fred astaire and ginger rogers  sets them up for love this is a story about dreamers and the dream factory carried aloft by music and generously wrapped in nostalgiabeneath it all there is a narrative but it feels inconsequential to the music the bittersweet romance is harmonic scaffold for songs and dance that lift you with promises and hopes then land you onto the soft sands of lifes disappointments the characters of mia and sebastian are not developed in great depth because they are avatars for generations of dreamers who have been drawn like moths to fame their synergy is palpablethis film is full of memorable moments the scene where sebastian talks passionately about the dynamics of jazz musicianship is captivating the moonlight walks through the city are surreal and the final scene against a painfully hesitant piano solo of city of stars will squeeze tears out of anyone  and then make you hum the melody for daysgreat cinematography is not unusual these days but the camera is like an artists brush that composes beautiful portraits against stunning urban landscapes in colour palettes that are richly retro yet totally modern this is a film to bathe yourself in let its exuberance musicality and nonsensical scenes of flyaway romance dazzle you todays world needs more,happy
i had watched at tiff 2016 and it was a definite highlight of the festival having had seen director damien chazelles previous film whiplash and being utterly blown away by it i went into with very high expectations im happy to say i was far from disappointed tonally was very different from whiplash one was an intense and dark psychological thriller whereas this was a brilliant comedic and emotional romance but chazelles style can still be seen in this film with two stellar films under his belt im incredibly exited for chazelles next projectperformances from ryan gosling and especially emma stone were absolutely astounding both of the stars were able to authentically portray such a vast range of emotion as well as deliver great musical performances the chemistry between the two actors was great gosling and stone were able to believably play off of one another and it made for an entertaining and emotionally engaging relationship to watch unfold john legend gave a good performance in his supporting role although he was outshone by the stars of the film the costume and set design were expertly done and well utilized in the story where a lesser film may establish character through expository dialogue chazelle tells the audience what there is to know about his characters by showing us details like the color of her dress the dustiness of his apartment or even the make of his car the miseenscene is employed to establish the tone of the movie for example there are multiple comedic scenes in which the comedy is derived from the clash between the costumes and setting a more dramatic tragic scene uses the lighting to communicate to us the emotions which the characters are trying to communicate to each other the lighting would often be used as a way to transport the film from the real world to a more dreamlike surreal timeless space in many scenes the hue of the lighting is used to represent emotion or even to represent a particular character the use of spotlights was also helpful to establish tone and moodthe cinematography is stunning with a wide variety of beautiful shots is able to convey emotion a simple pointofview shot can turn a stereo speaker into a symbol of longing or a stained ceiling into a symbol of desperation the production of some of the shots were impressive especially during the musical numbers these scenes employed a variety of long shots crane shots and dolly shots another example of raw talent to be marveled atthe editing was good chazelle knew when to cut and when not to cut cuts were strategically placed for the sake of comedy similarly other shots would linger for a decent length to emphasize the drama and tension of the scenethis entire review can be spent discussing the films soundtrack not only did this film display what is perhaps this decades greatest soundtrack yet but the score was so essential to the movie whenever placed in the film the lyrics and tone of the music perfectly compliment the tone and plot every single piece of music in this film is so expertly written and fits so superbly within the film there are plenty of clever double and triple entendres in songs like city of stars which comment on the plot and the larger themes of the film all at once the musical performances by gosling stone and john legend were all out of this world the soundtrack is the highlight of this film and it will without a doubt win at least one oscar come februarythe story was simplistic yet admirably written unlike many romantic films that will force in some contrived conflict between the two leads in order to push the film into the third act every plot point in feels natural and believable there are a couple of encounters and events towards the beginning of the film that feel a little too coincidental but as long as you can suspend your disbelief a little they wont be anything that will ruin the movie if i had to choose i would say that the plot is the weakest element of this film if not only because every other aspect was done so perfectly was an amazing alluring magnificent emotional rollercoaster of a film i am excited to see it again when it opens next week and to see it win at the oscars the opening scene alone is worthy of multiple oscars so it wouldnt be surprising if this took home best picture this film is an anthem for all the fools who dream 910 best film of 2016 so far,happy
clearly wants to evoke classic movie musicals like singing in the rain or the band wagon but its casting is closer to later star driven musicals like my fair lady the difference is that the former starred people known for their dancing or singing while the latter cast nonmusical stars likely to carry the movie with their star powerin terms of star power does pretty well with a good performance by ryan gosling as a jerky musician and an amazing one by emma stone who is every bit as good as she was in birdland the stars have good chemistry as the follow the traditional holllywood trajectory from sniping to googly eyesin my fair lady rex harrison didnt try to sing he just talked through the numbers and audrey hepburn was redubbed but in the stars are singing and dancing as best they can and the movie bows to their weaknesses with songs that arent difficult to sing and dance numbers that stay pretty simple because of this there are no great musical numbers there are some cute ones with songs that are almost memorable and dance numbers that replace impressive performance with cute ideas but there is no astaire dancing on the ceiling and there is no minelli telling us that life is a cabaret the sort of performers whose singing or dancing could power an amazing number  gene kelly ann powell jennifer hudson donald oconner tommy tune  are in short supply nowadays the choreographer may also simply have lacked the adventuress spirit the first nonstar number is fun but nonmusical malcolm xs one musical number was more memorablemy girlfriend liked this slightly amateurhour approach and felt it was unfair to contrast the film with something like singin in the rain but i disagree because really goes out of its way to say look this is just like those old movies with a slightly more complex view of relationships i feel like really does want to have an amazing dance number but knows it doesnt have the stars to pull it off which may be why the films most striking set piece which comes right at the end isnt a musical number at all even though it references a fewi liked the movie its fun escapist musical entertainment but i find the critical raves a little puzzling it is a good solid movie but it pales in comparison with truly great musicals like an america in paris cabaret sweet charity or west side story,happy
first i wanna say its a different movie from the others who were competing in the golden globes academy awards etc it mixes comedy drama musical emma stone did well with her role this is her year her chemistry with ryan gosling was demonstrated in the movie this movie was also different because it didnt have a happy ending,happy
opening scene of is spectacle it is good to see that there is still a place for a old kind of musicals without a doubt is a classic and it promise a good for upcoming hollywood musicals is one of the best movies of 2016 and it will pick many oscars next february it is not a realistic movie but it as a musical it is a perfect hit if you dont have a two weeks lasting earworm after this movie it is a miracle story is sweet but not too sweet and the ending is bittersweet something to expect from hollywoods dream factoryemma stones and ryan goslings chemistry works and feels right even is quite old fashion movie it is well done and feels fresh it is a kind of movie that you wish to see many more in the future it is must movie for all romanticist and all the people who want to watch old fashion musicals perfect sunday entertainment,happy
is one of if not the most entertainingemotionalbreathtaking humorousheartfelt and inspiring movies of all time is truly a love letter to the art of cinema during my experience while watching the i did not notice any negatives only posatives the acting is amazing especially emma stone who gives perhaps he greatest performance yetryan gosling is outstanding also the soundtrack for the movie is some of the best ever put on the silver screeni highly recommend 1010,happy
is undoubtedly a brilliant film i have not seen many musicals and admittedly i bore a fairlystereotypical sceptical view of suchthat is until i watched this babyi used to think that the musical was all about you guessed it the music but nowi think theres more to it than thati liked the music it was original and it was definitely good but it wasnt outstanding it was special with the plot which was also brilliant the plot was that of two peoplean aspiring jazzy pianist and an aspiring actresswho after a multitude of chance encounters share a relationshipone that is almost as if they are exploiting each other to attempt to realise their ambitions by feeding off emotion and who soon realise that to realise their gluttonous ambitions they may not be able to love each other as well,happy
in some ways this made me not enjoy the movie quite so much but it did make me appreciate it more the slow beginning and the inconsistent rules of how the musical numbers worked were more acceptable once i realized how they fit in with the world of the movie theres been a lot of hype surrounding this movie particularly with its pending oscar nominations so i had rather high expectations when i entered the theater the praise it has received is welldeserved the technical work that was put in is phenomenal and i would not argue if it won best picture though i havent seen any of the other nominees the only nomination i disagree with is best screenplay there were scenes that i thought were wellcrafted but as a whole the script was flawed i dont mean to say that it was bad but i would hope that there were better scripts writtenthematically it was very good but speaks mostly to those with careers in the arts as one of those people i loved how sebastian and mia drove each other to pursue their real dreams and not just half of their dreams its a trap that im sure many people fall into when pursuing a career in show business the ending was spectacular in capping off the themes that had been presented sebastians dream of what he wished had happened showed how much he and mia had to sacrifice in order to achieve their dreams which i thought was great so often we see movies that end with the protagonist achieving all of hisher goals in some capacity it was great to see the protagonists feel the weight of the emotional sacrifices that they had to make for each other and more than that they chose their dreams at expense of their relationship with each other a lot of people may see that as a heartless ending but there are plenty of movies where couples throw away their jobs to be togetherthe musical aspect of it is not that prevalent the opening number with everyone dancing around made me skeptical because i dont care for musicals but thankfully there was little dancing in the rest of it there is still music but it comes in a more natural context if you havent already guessed the film is very artsy which could mean that more casual viewers might not like it so much it will probably keep your attention but its main goal is not to entertain however if you are okay with that try to get out and see it in theaters overall rating 7610,happy
admittedly this was the first time experiencing a romantic musical at the cinema for me and i was a little apprehensive drawn in by the accolades it had received however my wife and i decided to give it a go and took our seats at the local movie theatre on a saturday evening how good could a musical love story really be two hours later i had my answer and that answer was very very very good indeedthe first twenty minutes or so of the movie is very much a full on musical affair songs huge dance sequences very vibrant and colourful and its ok if you like that sort of thing but then there is a moment when the two main characters connect and you connect with them and from that point onwards the film just gets better and better until the ending which stays with you for days afterwards along with the haunting piano melody of mia and sebastians theme tune gosling and stones onscreen chemistry is the best youll see all year natural and believable they draw you right into the story i cant imagine another two actors who would fit this movie as well as they do the other real star of the show is los angeles this movie is a real homage to the city of angels the sunsets palm trees beaches and warm colours of the horizon seen from the hollywood hills adds to the romance and is all shot so beautifully that it makes you want to book a flight and visitdefinitely a movie to watch at the cinema if you still can if you connect with the characters and story then you most definitely wont regret it,happy
is nominated for a recordtying 14 categories obviously including best picture at the 2017 oscars and it would definitely deserve the win if so damien chazelle is an incredibly talented young director with both his feature films nominated and both being the greatest achievements in musical films of the 2010sis both a love statement to the classic hollywood musicals and a bold new direction for the genre that never looked more done for if not for chazelle sebastian and mia both have dreams of glory and both of them are talented artists shes a wannabe actress and hes a wannabe jazz player for two thirds of the movie were fooled into thinking that nothing will divert from the canon except more or less the setting but little by little an attentive observer notices how intelligent the plot structure really is the ending feels extremely sour on one hand and yet happy on the other which is perfectly represented with those last beautiful smiles some may not like it but a story like this manages to cover both the dreamlike state of musical characters and the new more grounded conscience of modern filmmakers that never touched the musical romance beforelll has a lot in common with whiplash under a directorial point of view and yet it manages to stand on its own quite well they share a love for grandangular shots and bold camera movements but lll stands out with its incredible long takes coordinated with the musical pieces on that account lll stands out once more its alloriginal musics feel modern and classic at the same time and they are sided with fantastic dance choreographies although sometimes the leads dont seem to dance perfectly theyre still actors not professional dancers chazelle plays to the limit with chromatic effects throughout the movie the colors on the scene are generally extremely bright and his use of the lens generates strange optic effects of dots of light on the side of some framesstone and goslings performances are a true tour de force they act brilliantly sing lovingly and dance like they worked in broadway all year long as i said the dance sections are not without imperfections but to think what these two went through to accomplish this is simply amazing stones performance is particularly noteworthy as she acts like she cant act very well but not even that badly during her auditions which is something any actor would want to do that well gosling unexpectedly shines more in the musical pieces solidifying himself as a multifaceted talentis definitely one of the movies of the year 2016 as it renews a dying genre with vigor talent and new spirit,happy
i guess i should say i didnt like whiplash at all or to be more precise it was a pretty interesting watch for anyone whos into music in general and jazz in particular but on the whole in my view  a really thin piece of cinema but this one  didnt expect it from chazelle but its  simply  beautiful not only is it a virtually perfect movie which carries you along all the way through while surprising at every turn to totally carry away at the end its the most beautiful moving and genuine work ive seen in some really serious while and as far as im concerned somewhat misunderstood on the both sides of the barricade that is it has little to do with writing a love letter to hollywood  for which hollywood seems to like it so much and so many other people seem to just as seriously hate it or to modern hollywood at any rate  while old hollywood here should rather be read as a metaphor  nor is it supplemented with a forced or artsy finale  another reason for this hate  because its not just a romantic story as far as i can see this movie is about so many other things as well its about chance and fate personal happiness and personal integrity following signs and making your own choices freedom and responsibility its about cause and effect dreams and reality about whether this reality is benignly indifferent or can be on your side about what it ultimately is and what it takes to find and walk your own path through itits impeccably written immaculately executed and perfectly structured in dramatic terms the intonation is flawless no wrong notes always organically dramatic never melodramatic good performances especially stone dont quite remember the last time i saw such meaningful cuts  eisenstein would be proud and the last note does last  when the show was through i somehow couldnt get away from the theater and roamed for hours in circles in the vicinity then got back for no reason and just sat there in the lobby until they had to drive me out at night so the stuff stays with you  to say the least anyways if you havent yet go and see it its there its cinema not sure about fellinis aerodromes but it looks like some of his random planes are still in the air hooahand a piece of advice  watch the credits up to the very end,happy
jazz  let it die it had its time well not on my watch for the majority of the movie buffs in india who barely know anything about jazz music which includes me too that line wouldnt make much impact but embark on the 2hour musical voyage of feel the time freezing around you while sebastian presses the keys to his piano one by one in the end and you would seriously reconsider your stand on it jazz would barge into your playlists and hearts with easelike the bits and pieces that we carry from movies like titanic casablanca a beautiful mind the pulp fiction dark knight rises or take any other alltime classics for an instance there are a whole lot of elements in too that would win an eternal life in your memoriesits a magical blend of the following concepts  success that comes with a price the beauty and liberty in jazz that the musicians are trying to rescue from extinction love thats governed by the universal laws drama that isnt so dramatic but sweet and unbelievably beautiful with insanely vivid shots the art of dreaming and the life through a musical kaleidoscope and so many its pure magic mia and sebastian will make you stoned with their dreams music and love you might cry like a baby at the end of it  not because of the story but for the perfect blend of something that the world of cinemas has long forgottentwo parallel but very different streams of realizing the dreams that starts at a common point but having no confluence and only a hardhitting end which is hard to digestabout the two streams one reminds us of a line from the book the alchemist by paulo coelho the miner was about to give it all up right at the point when if he were to examine just one more stone  just one more  he would find his emeraldand the second is a story of success through sacrifice thats part and parcel of certain decisions they are the gamechangers but you cant actually judge if its good and bad its life  the art and beauty of pain that makes for a melancholymia  i never knew emma stone was so talented if jennifer lawrence won an oscar i think mia in shouldnt even be challenged this time hollywood has the firepower i have realized and i have madly fallen in love with mia futile i knowsebastian a gift from god that fell into ryan goslings laps with his nonchalant yet musical expressions he will show you that this is the role he was born to dowell every shot is beautiful and even if it is irritatingly pink and candy at times you wouldnt care this is cinema without the privilege of retakes depending only on sheer talent and perfection through hardwork and practicei dont think i have done justice to this writeup and i seriously think language should give writers unprecedented liberty to come up with new words and phrases to expresses themselves when it comes to movies like this no other goi repeat  this is cinema,happy
where to start with a review of the most talkedabout movie of the moment well how about with what it is not watching last night i fairly quickly decided that the film was not what the majority of critics had labelled it a homage piece to 1950s musicals with the exception of one or two of the opening scenes the film lacks the giant sound stage atmosphere of a studio musical and is instead rooted much more firmly in the la of today it is perhaps better described as romance first love letter to la and jazz second and homage to studio movies in general rather than just the musical variety third indeed the films many references both in dialogue and style to casablanca signpost this wider homagethat jazz features so prominently once again in damien chazelles third movie is unsurprising after the success of whiplash  it will be more of a shock if it is a centrepiece of his next movie neil armstrong biopic first man which may give us a better impression of whether he is capable of diversity as well as quality the direction in is very solid and gives the impression of a writerdirector who knows exactly how he wants his movie to unfold the pace of the movie is very easy and relaxing and i found myself enjoying each moment without concentrating on what might be coming next an all too rare experience and one of the most likable aspects of the filmperhaps one of the only real negatives of the film for me was the freedom given to cinematographer linus sandgren of american hustle and joy fame whose camera work was ostentatious at times and distracted from the more grounded feel that chazelle and lead actors emma stone and ryan gosling brought to the filmcentred as it is on the romance between the leads the movie simply wouldnt work without the excellent performances of stone and gosling stone uses her expressiveness with great subtlety steering the film equally well through moments of emotional drama and romantic fantasy gosling will be credited most for his musical talent which is coupled with the effortless pensive charm that has become his trademark i have read criticism of their singing and dancing but feel that this is misplaced were the film the musical in the gene kelly style that many critics have dubbed it this might be a relevant criticism however the film that i saw suited the slightly understated musical performances which complemented its relaxed grounded feelmy final thoughts are on the overall theme of the movie for a romantic fantasy the movie is surprisingly thoughtprovoking and presents a nuanced stance on the conflicts between love and success which felt accessible despite its hollywood glamour the achievement of this balance between fantasy and realism owes a great deal to chazelles wittyyetbelievable dialogue and the performances of the two leadsapproach this movie without the desire to shoehorn it into one genre or another and i think you will be pleased by how many sizes it fits,happy
it is a fun film but the last scene makes this film a great movie i bet you want to dance and sing with your loved one like them after the film please do it and you will feel refresh and want to believe your dream i wonder what would be a taste if they pick other actor and actress since it is for dreamers new comers but ryan and emma were great combinations my wife was kept saying he is perfectone day you will face some difficulties and hope ryan gosling will cheer you up and guide you to the right directionsorry my poor english but hope you enjoy,happy
i have always struggled with musicals they always seemed like cheesy and unnatural to me that was before today when i was presented to this masterpiece of a filmfrom the very start when the iconic cinemascope logo pops up you know that the movie will be an ode to the art of cinema the cinematography is astonishing and reminds me of hitchcock and the golden days of hollywoodthe soundtrack by justin hurwitz is extremely well done and it fits the setting and the characters in a natural way with the musical scenes being natural and thoughtful ryan goslings acting is close to perfect and his style of visual comedy is fitting the movie and emma stone can actually singthis movie convinced me that hollywood is more than box office,happy
recently filmmaker ridley scott admitted that he found the current state of cinema to be declining and even himself admitted to being asked numerous times to be a director or somehow involved in any number of superhero related movies thankfully to this day he has not done so and while some of his choices as a director or producer tend to be a little perplexing and leaving the viewer wondering why he did said project i think he may be on to something with the general statement that cinema does seem to be declining in quality and what would have played on the big screen even 30 to 40 years ago is not the same today and that same level of expertise artistry and quality just doesnt seem to be there a lot of the time jeanluc godard once famously said that cinema began with dw griffith and ends with abbas kiarostami with the unfortunate passing of kiarostami this past year does that mean cinema is definitely gone for good in some ways yes but then again on the other hand you have a film like which is very much in the same kind of style and spirit of the movies of yesterday while being completely original on its own so maybe in a sense there is still hope for todays cinema yet within the first ten to fifteen minutes of i really was not anticipating that i would end up liking the film as much as i did the film started out with bubbly and very much pop flavoured dance and musical numbers that seemed so happy and bright that i felt that if the whole movie was this upbeat and sunny than i probably should have seen something else at the theatre instead because what i was witnessing was so sickeningly sweet that it would even turn most kids who grow up on that stuff off of it thankfully however the trailers i had seen for the film as well as everything else i knew about it proved to be true and that wasnt the kind of film this was going to be instead we do have a film that in its own way is trying to recapture the magic and charm of the movies that generations ago people grew up on and films and music that we should be watching today instead of the countless hours we throw away on mindless entertainment and games with no redeeming qualities whatsoever the film loves old hollywood from the movies to the actors to the big budget musicals of yesteryear it also pays homage to music such as the jazz classics that i know any die hard jazz fan would go head over feet over in a sense those also attuned to movies with a more european feel think the french new wave of the 50s and 60s will also most likely find a lot to like here as well because this film is not simply just plagiarizing these movies and cultural icons of old but instead borrows from their styles and techniques and as i said earlier they make a movie all their own using those trademark pieces of style and music and they do so in a way that is pulled off to perfection and will leave even the hardest of film critics longing for movies from decades ago pretty pleased at what still proves to be talent and good work with movies and filmmakers in this current generation the film is more than anything else a love story between two people who often at first seem completely at odds with each other but with any good romance sometimes the opposites do attract and can lead to magic the film also incorporates old hollywood and the fact that many classic films and even styles of music are dying because todays generation is different people are now so into themselves or their electronic devices that they no longer have the interest or curiosity about the true arts anymore i once had a film professor acquaintance who told me that in his university film class that the students he had did not want to see older movies but things that were current or modern at least to them how incredibly sad reaches out to those lost arts and shows us that these forms of art definitely need to stay alive and need to be rediscovered by each and every generation the film also details the struggles of trying to make it in the arts scene and with all the rejections and disappointments you get sometimes it definitely is hard to keep your chin up however these characters have perseverance and will give it everything they got and ultimately prove that dreams can happen and sometimes with a little help you get not just get what you want but maybe something better is lying just around the corner for you has a lot of style the musical numbers are all very well done and its a film with some great character development and it truly will be relatable to this generation but countless others as well this is a film of originality that proves that hollywood is not dead yet nor is film and we might just have a few surprises left from some up and coming filmmakers so with films like hollywood and film is still alive and thriving for now at least which i think is a great place to be,happy
when a movie starts winning awards all the awards in this case at the golden globes we often want to know what the message is behind the movie when a film is up for seven of the most prestigious golden globe awards including best picture and screenplay and it wins every one of them then it certainly must be a movie with a message i really liked the film i was invested in the characters i liked them i cared what happened to them i recommend the film and i wholeheartedly recommend you watch it in the spirit or under the spell if you will of the purpose of the movie if you do i believe you will enjoy it all the more after the golden globes the news of the night seemed to be meryl streeps rebuking remarks and whether or not they were justified for me however the focus of the night was on this movie musical and its significant message in his acceptance speech producer marc platt spelled out the message beautifully and simply he said and he put a shout out for more of cinema to do the same the picture was to make us feel not through cynicism or irony but with unbridled joy and passion to dream more urgently to live more fervently and love more deeply and now more than ever to find music and cinema that enters our mind and our soul and our hearts and unites us thats the message of this movie embrace it and youre going to love it,happy
after eagerly anticipating for the best part of a year i managed to catch an early showing in mid december in vietnam of all places in all honesty the first scenesong caught me slightly off guard an incredibly well orchestrated flashmob that scream high school musical  however my doubts were quickly cast aside as the camera began to rise triumphantly above the scene on the freeway after that i fell in love with it almost instantlyis it too bold to call damien chazelle my favourite director after only two feature length pictures whiplash was perhaps the most exciting cinema experience of my life was equally engaging yet far more magical chazelles love for jazz transcends cinema  so much so that filmlovers such as myself with no previous interest in the musical movement become entirely enthralled by the subject matter this film is about art far more than it is about love and justin hurwitz deserves credit for this for his stunning musical score a soundtrack that has already been played too many times in my carthe chemistry between ryan gosling and emma stone make this film truly beautiful i cant imagine anyone else playing the lead characters two lovers who sacrifice a romantic love for their true desires their seamless performances will surely reap the rewards this award season yet it was not their acting but their singing that made their portrayals so real neither actor possesses the traditional flawless falsetto of a hollywood musical star but thats what made so magical  more real its quirky and its clumsy and utterly engrossing ive read a lot about how emulated so much of the classic musicals of the great hollywood era yet i can say rather naively with little to no knowledge of such classics that felt to me like an entirely modern electrifying take on the genre a month later and its yet to be released in the uk but i will definitely be seeing this again,happy

the uninspired dance routines the overthetop body language and facial expressions the utter lack of subtlety the clumsy lousy dance routines i just hated it allgoslings acting was bearable definitely the most talented believable actor in the movie emma stone has a decent voice but is no dancer so she was honestly a very odd choice for the leada few fair moments but mostly just a disappointment,happy
anyone who says this film is overrated is probably insensitive to musicals this is a masterpiece of cinematography and character development,happy
while the storyline may not be appreciated by all who watch this film there is no denying this is one masterpiece of a film chazelles use of colour sound and light are some of the most creative ive ever seen the cinematography was used very creatively to work with the other visual components of the film both gosling and stone give terrific performances and perfectly showcase their skills in both acting and singing ultimately a very enjoyable cinematic experience,happy
absolute rubbish not even worth my words other people here must be on drugs crap,happy
i watched this film as it was being pitched as an amazing eventquite frankly it was a load of rubbishthe story was poor the singing and song content mediocre and it was less believable than the recent so called epic noahtime in my life that i will never get back,happy
i dont understand why this movie got so many awards this was one of the worst musicals in the history of worst musicals the music was terrible and the plot was confusing i had a headache after the first 2 songs i will never be watching this movie again,happy
as a musical lover i attempted to watch this musical several times before finally making it through the whole thing the music was dull no powerful singing the plot was drab utterly disappointed after all the rave reviews ive heard,happy
i like musicals i like it very much in a fact i love them my brother used to tease me because of that but this is boring there is no story not a song to tackle you to stand up and dance except aha  take on me on the pool i cannot imagine why this film got so many oscars rely why i have switched channel after 45 minutes did not want to ruin my entire sunday evening,happy
films like these makes me wonder and think that some producers are 3 year old kids who are in love with sponge bob and have not seen a decent movie in all their lives why would anybody put two dollar together to produce such a nonsense there is no story there are no good songs the actors can barely sing a lullaby,happy
so disappointing i was bored from beginning to end the songs the singing the story there was nothing that really grabbed my attention cannot rap my head around the fact that this movie recieved so many oscars just baffled,happy
i may have noticed that this film won the oscars so ill write a review about it the characters of this film are listed belowmia is number one in the character list because i love women and girls her face looks pretty although i hate it when she argues with otherssebastian comes next in because his romantic fascination for mia is high however i dont like it when hes been accused for raping peopleim a little tired to continue writing for now  and i dont want to know much about the other characters anyway this film has lovely characteristics and i hope you think like that too,happy
just do not understand what all the fuss is about maybe i am missing something,happy
not worth the time boring bad music just plain stupid,happy
it is one of the worse movies i have seen recently just judge properly the beginning and you will realize it is actually eyesore theres no beautiful love story theres no amazing music theres no breath taking acting and theres no even sense of humor the whole movie is boring plain insipid and so bad that made me fall asleep i know my review sounds a bit plain too but is just only because is such a bad movie that people need to stop writing long reviews about it its horrible and that is thatps the summary is a venezuelan joke which basically means bo bo boring as fck,happy
a few days ago my friends showed me they loved it and raved about how amazing and beautiful it is and got mad at me when i said i didnt really care for it why is there such a hype about this film i dont understand why its gotten nominated for so many awards i just didnt like it the beginning starts out like any other musical a huge catchy dance number we meet mia an aspiring actress and sebastian a wannabe jazz musician both arent succeeding with their dreams they keep bumping into each other and eventually fall in love but mia breaks it off when sebastian seems to be giving up on his dreams he got to her takes her to one last audition and she makes it as a huge actress they dont stay together at the end mia and her husband go to a jazz cafe she sees sebastian and theres a montage of what their relationship couldve been i loved the music and i love the costumes thats about it the movie is centered around jazz which is historically from an africanamerican background yet sebastian who absolutely loves jazz is white and so is mia i think it wouldve been a lot better with a more diverse cast to me the first part didnt match the second the first part is like a regular musical except emma stone cant sing but the second part tries really hard to be an artistic abstract unique film those two parts didnt mesh together at all was this meant to be artistic or a big musical when i mentioned to my friends that emma stone cant sing they said that thats the point that its meant to feel realistic yet the singing audio of her is obviously inserted from a studio if its meant to be realistic why didnt they sing live also why were none of the main songs in the musical jazz songs if its meant to be centered around jazz i did like that mia and sebastian didnt end up together however i think it couldve been done so much better with a smaller cast smaller budget live singing and a diverse cast overall i thought wasnt too horrible but it definitely wasnt great i dont understand how a movie can be beautiful with such a mismatched style i wouldnt watch it again but i do listen to the soundtrack,happy
i am quite late to the party but i finally saw today its hard to give a numerical rating to a nontraditional film like this one and i have to say i am so fresh from watching it and the feelings are percolating still but here goesi am not usually a fan of musicals and i must say i found the storytelling at first to be more goofy and comical than serious and dramatic it took me a while to get into it so to speak but i finally became interested in mia and sebastians story when mia requested a certain song from the band at the party that sebastian happened to be playing inonce i got involved in the characters and their coinciding story lines i got invested in their successes failures and relationship at the point in which sebastian returns home to their shared apartment his place originally and prepares mia a surprise meal then she walks in and they begin talkingchecking in with where they are both at in their lives thats when the disappointment set in i was hoping it would play out differently sure they both succeeded in their dreams but they did not succeed togetherand to show a faux flashback where it shows them together succeeding with childrenall while hes playing their song it was manipulative it showed me what i had wanted for them and possibly what they had both wanted yetit didnt happen so the ending was sad and it made me frustrated and a bit angryof course i see why this film is a top rated and oscar winning film i cannot argue that the music was lovely and their song was catchy emma and ryan were perfect in their roles8 out of 10 stars merely because it had a bittersweet sad ending and because it still seemed to lack the intensity i like to see in films,happy
ive now watched this film four timesthe 1st time i watched this i went wow at the opening number on the freeway the next number was good but then it went flat for me that was until the last number which was wonderful all that made me think what had i missed in the middle why had this film won so many oscars this had to have another view2nd time i watched it i started to see the threads of how it was put together and i saw the relevance of the scene where mia orders two coffees 3rd time i watched it i watched it with an understanding of why this film won so many oscars4th time i think it was probably because i may have finally learned to love jazz,happy
damien chazelles whiplash was a fantastic movie so i was excited to see what he did next and is probably my favourite musical evermusicals are not my type of movie and this movie of course has the scenes of people getting up singing and dancing their hearts out but in no scene does it without progressing the story in some way which i loved not only is the nonstop use of music actually good but also never feels like it was forced into the movie damien chazelle is a genius and his obvious love for jazz seeped through the screen throughout the movie and contains one of the most underrated scenes in this movie where ryan gosling talks about jazz and his love for it and this theme is probably my favourite of the filmthe only downside to this movie is the inevitable lack of people being interested in a musical as they may not believe they will see a great story as well which is definitely evident herethis addition to damien chazelles collection is very welcome and one of the best musicals in recent memory we can only hope that chazelle expands his work outside of movies about music so he can be appreciated by a wider audience with he has proved that he is capable,happy
aside from the clichridden plot youve seen a bazillion times i was reminded constantly that people who have made it are playing people trying to make it had this been cast with people who actually need that big break i might have been able to forgive the clichridden plot and hopped on boardgosling and stone have zero range and their roles make their abilities only stick out like sore thumbs cant sing cant dance cant act seriously how much did stones team pony up for her to bag an oscar she is an actress playing an actress but couldnt convince me of even that and gosling is nothing but droopy locks and a grin unfortunately thanks to eva mendes we cant ship droopy locks back to canada until she kicks him to the curb or their kids turn 18four more beefs1 stone skips town because her brilliant onewoman show flops forcing the theater owners to eat the money she owes them that does not happen in real life2 who the hell blows beaucoup bucks on a band with no shot of charting in the top 1003 gosling proclaims that jazz is dying  which explains the hordes of 20somethings at his jazz club4 i lived in boulder city the name of the library is the boulder city public library the films assistant prop manager is supposedly from boulder city but didnt set the hack  sorry director  straight i assume because she didnt want to lose her jobspeaking of jobs earth to john legend dont quit your day job whatever that is,happy
mia dolan emma stone is an aspiring actress just like her roommate friends and the multitudes of beautiful girls in hollywood sebastian wilder ryan gosling is obsessed with traditional jazz and opening his own pure jazz club he is often his own worst enemy the two have a combative cutest of meetcutes i ran she leaves her boyfriend he tries to grow up for her and accepts a place in his friend keith john legends band they struggle to chase their dreamsthis is a love letter to hollywood especially the golden age of old hollywood the movie had a quick rise leading up to an infamous night at the oscars and an almost as quick of a backlash the complaints of clich hokey and less than epic singing and dancing from the leads are all fitting to some extend the problem is that those complaining are actually missing the point firstly stone and gosling are perfect cast with their tryhard gleeloving pureloveliness personalities they are not the best singers or dancers they are the high school drama kids who made it big they are drama geeks and thats exactly what this movie is about its drama geek heaven it revels in the old hollywood clichs i especially love the poignant ending this is happiness in celluloid form,happy
its a good film dancing singing blah i saw in the theater thinking of a comedy film but nope a musical i think the best part is the ending yes the ending dont mind the spoiler but the part i like is when maia and whatever his name is ends up with someone else old people complained but i liked it and you will to my only few complaints are there is a unneeded f bomb really and they dont really tell you emma stone and that other dudes name i suggest it to all,happy
i really like la which is the stage of this movie but im not satisfied with the way to end the story actually however we can also say that its a typical love story through musical to put it simply it also shows us our real issues of what we have to think about what our important and valuable thing is i think this is the most difficult issue which everyone facesthe jazz music in it is especially comfortable to listen to it makes me play the saxophone or the piano again since i was a junior high school studentalso its private but id been in la for a year until last summer and i like los angeles very much as i mentioned above so i really feel nostalgic griffith observatory and even the traffic in this movie i guess anyone who watches it will want to go to la its a very nice city,happy
this is a story about two people sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone who cross paths looking to find their dream of fame it is a throwback to the great musical films the film is critically acclaimed and indeed people who love those old musicals and theater in general fall in love with anything that might emulate the golden age of filmdomi love emma stone and everything i have seen her in this was not her film the singing while okay but uneven were they lipsyncing i kept thinking anne kendrick would have nailed it better and ryan gosling i still havent figured out how he lands parts although i did like him in that one thingor was that ryan reynolds the throwback aspect made me think this was a woody allen film for nonintellectuals the dialogue was bland while at the same time tried too hardworth a view if your into that kind of entertainment i thought is was mediocre as a musical and a chick flick and emma geez girl get some sunguide 1 fword minor swearing no sex or nudity,happy
this movie is about a romance story between a man and a woman a man would like to own his bar which he can play jazz music as he likes he meets a woman who would like to be an actress in a jazz bar first they do not like each other but a closer relationship between them is brought by a common hobby i like a lot of dancing and singing scenes especially a lovely night this scene has a singing part in the former half and a dancing part in the latter half they say you are not type for me and our relationship never becomes a romance to each other so i can understand they do not like one another however i am fascinating of their harmonious tap dance as i do not feel they do not like each other i am impressed with the first scene that many people dance in a highway first i do not think this scene is related to the story but it is the important scene that the man and encounters the woman the song and dance are so attractive  so i think it is a good introduction i can enjoy the process of developing their love and music and dance i cannot expect the ending but i like this movie as i bought a sound track cd,happy
this movie is amazing it shows clear difference of what we think and what actually happen with a musical combo the movie ends with a smile which shows smile always and respect your loved ones awesome story linei wish i could watch this movie with my love,happy
normally i would avoid any sort of musical film like the plague i dont like musicals i never have and thought i never would but when scooped up 6 oscars and was nominated for a further 8 i just had to see it not only did i not hate it but it was probably one of the most enjoyable and memorable movie experiences ive had in a long timethere are so many factors that contribute to making this film what it is but i just have to talk about the incredible cinematography which is on another level to anything ive seen before each scene is crafted with immaculate attention to detail and each frame is like a work of art it really is a joy to watch then theres gosling and stone who bring so much to their roles and seemed to take to the singing and dancing effortlesslyi must admit that i was a little skeptical about the enormous amount of hype surrounding this film  more often than not it leads to disappointment on this occasion however i think its justified is a wonderful viewing experience and one of the years must see movies,happy
emma stone was a perfect choice with ryan gosling this movie is about how to reach your dreams and what happen if your dreams came true another important thing in this movie is love the true love and the question is can we be strong enough to drop the true love to make our dream real so i would like to recommend this movie to everyone who has a dreams but not strong enough to make it,happy
set in contemporary times beaming with optimism and soaked in nostalgia the oldfashioned romance tugs at your heartstrings with its relevance and simplicity it reminds you who you were before failures made you practical the performances and chemistry between the lead actors is remarkable emma stone stands out as the sparkly girl whose eyes speak a million words,happy
i absolutely loved this movie i still love seeing it everyday very emotional and moving good for when you are in a bad or good mood some days i am just sitting there and i just say to myself i need to watch when i get homenow that is literally me every day that is how good it is and that is coming from me me i am really hard to impress this movie made me fall in love with emma stane and ryan gosling,happy
if you havent seen it yet or the hype hadnt convinced you  just believe me now when i say  you need to go to the cinema asap just one warning though you wont be able to get the music out of your head imdb sums up the movie in one sentence but there is so much more to it although i have to say  a jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in los angeles  is the only way to describe the plot without giving away any of the important scenes so lets start shall we the movie begins with the most clich musical scene ive encountered in a long time but it sets the mood for whats to come being everything else but clich sure here we have a case of a kinda corny love story but it is full of surprise fraught with intelligent conversations and witty comebacks and most importantly has an open end to open up a whole new world for your imagination our protagonists are mia and sebastian played by emma stone and ryan gosling the best movie couple they could have found for these characters the seem so harmonious together its sad at the end of the movie you have to discover this isnt real life also the music oh have i mentioned the music ive never been a fan of jazz in fact id thought i didnt like it very much turns out ive just hadnt listened to the right stuff another thing that convinced me is that the soundtrack doesnt only contain jazz but also beautiful piano tracks sure one might argue they arent the type for musicals but this one seems to be different in so many ways the whole arrangement of different styles within the movie makes it dropdead gorgeous to watch even if you dont like the story if you havent figured it by now its a 1010 for me,happy
that ryan gosling takes role as a male main character reminds me of the film the note book 2004 which also has the quite similar storyline to 2016 except the 2004s one left me with better impression and absorbed in thought i have heard many compliments on before and my friend also recommends me this film but after spending 2 hours for it i end up feeling disappointed and let down the plot is relatively regular and not hard to predict however ill give an 8 for the stunning view and the marvelous starry sky scene,happy
i saw the movie and was truly touched and mesmerizedit is so true that  we all look and desire and achieve our dreams that is our alls city of stars the struggles are the same in everybodys city of starsvery well conceptualized movie indeed,happy
having 2 jobs because youre not sure if you can succeed in the one you are actually interested in is nothing out of the ordinary and our two main characters in this have issues with their dream and sometimes they sing and dance about them one of those moments is very early on when stuck in traffic suddenly everyone is joyously breaking out of their cars and start a dance number that does look like they actually trained for it  all joking aside you have to have a heart for this type of movie otherwise this is nothing you will enjoy at allhaving said all that there are different layers to this the drama works quite fine and there is quite a few different interpretations of certain things that happen its all fun and games until certain decisions have to be made that can be life altering the leads are exceptional and you may have seen them before together on screen maybe that helped their chemistry but what matters is that this works quite nicely,happy
everything about this film is great it is both extremely original and feels nostalgically familiar by making tribute to classic movies everything from the story to the cinematography and costumes is original refreshing and simply enjoyable the acting is superb emma stone is a force the music is not bad either one of the best movies in years a must see,happy
i had to watch this movie twice before i really like that but ill not tell you why  youre gonna find it out in the end as i watched it for a first time i was angry and disappointed but it was probably i havent in a right mood so i watch it again and it will be really poor when ill say i liked or enjoyed it i loved it everything from the beginning till the end fits its own place and from great actors performances scenery or camera or makeup or costumes this story is something i was probably looking for to see for a long time  dreamy romance between two people which met by accident and have they own artistic dreams and then support each other to make them a reality ill not say more cause i cant but definitely watch it youre gonna love it too i promise ,happy
is a musical masterpiece it has everything you want in a movie its got terrific performances excellent music beautiful scenery and a great story for all you jazz andor musicals fans out their i highly recommend for youthe premise of the story is that stone is a young actress who has moved to la to wait tables while auditioning to try and make it while gosling is a jazz purist anyone who doesnt like jazz just doesnt have the rightcontext he insists who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own jazz bar or to put it succinctly  two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams the musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between with great music throughoutthis film defies genre it is a masterpiece i urge you to see it yidioo,happy
im baffled by all of the negativity im seeing from reviewers on here i can guarantee you that this film deserves all of the credit bestowed and to watch it will not be a waste of your timei have grown to love this musical the more i that i watch it the characters are charming and ryan and emma once again put their chemistry to good use the reasons i feel that there has been backlash from the users are as follows1 the lack of skill from the stars to perform above par during the singing and dancing numbers i feel the need to mention that i too am a musical person as ive read from many reviewers that compare to the classics such as an american in paris and west side story this is not that kind of musical do not expect the leads to be within the same spectrum as gene kelley or judy garland or you will be sorely disappointed go in with an open mind know that the pair did their best and that the musical numbers are charming and the music is catchy2 the plot is drawn out has been done before and has no meaning i disagree with those opinions the story is spread out yes but i believe each scene is essential to understand the characters relationships with each other why theyre doing what theyre doing and how they ended up right where they should be upon their conclusion there are plenty of scenes that cover the spectrum of emotions i hoped to feel moments of joy laughter music romance sympathy and sadness there were no dull moments for me3 this was supposed to be a feel good movie and i left feeling depressed this is true while the film overall lifted my spirits the ending may not be what most viewers had hoped for the director himself said it was his intention to finish with a realistic ending as in the leads whom the whole story is focused upon do not end up together because of their careers leading them in different places they decide to see what happens if they focus on what they really want maybe its just me i do have a tendency to appreciate movies with emotional endings but i think that can be refreshing and true to how real life can be sometimes this is not meant to be a realistic film how ever the true story line is about our dreams and how our drive can get us to places we never thought possible sometimes the final outcome means we take chances or make sacrifices in our personal lives you never know what youll miss if you settle or dont go after what you truly want in life4 this movie is like la boasting about itself as some people have stated this is a love letter to la i have very fond memories of the city as i have always lived in california and so i have had many opportunities to visit and explore all it has to offer my mother had dated a man for a long time who lived in santa monica and he had always taken us to the most unique places and introduced me to its culture i love la the good and the bad was almost nostalgic for me to watch the unreal sunsets at griffith park a brief moment at the chteau marmount seeing the mountains behind the warner brothers lot and the manhattan beach pier all shot so beautifully reminded me of why i love that city so much i cant relate to the auditions or all of those clichs depicted of the business but im sure those scenarios came from someones true experiencesi dont always listen to critics i like what i like and no persons written words will influence me to the point that i would be raving about a terrible film i am not as some of the reviewers will refer to me as part of the herd and will not bah bah bah at you like sheep nor am i a professional critic or a person who has studied film extensively i am however a movie lover and a musical lover i havent enjoyed watching a film this much for a long time and it has been awhile since a movie has touched me as this one has the songs are beautiful and get stuck in your head as well so be warned all i ask is that before you listen to the critics or the reviewers on here that you at least give this gorgeous film a chance and go with an open mind,happy
in terms of acting emma stone is very good showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from ryan gosling dont understand how he even got nominated for best actorthe director seems to be inspired by bollywood numbers at the end mia day dreaming of sebastian approximately 7 minutes was way too much exaggeratedmy digital score 7510,happy
i have mixed feelings about this movie i really like musicals and also like jazz a lot so this movie should have been perfect for me but it isnt it started great with another day of sun and someone in the crowd i really enjoy these songs but it was only downhill from there there are only two more sung songs in the movie which is already pretty bad for a musical but they are also very weak because the main cast cant sing city of stars is awful must be one of the worst main songs of a famous musical ive ever heard the fools who dream isnt that great either its really telling that the two good songs have almost no contribution of emma stone and ryan gosling the plot is okay but told in a really boring way but there is also lightemma stone acted amazing what a performance the cinematography was superb i really enjoyed the lights costumes and camera work the epilogue medley was great too i expected a musical but i got a mediocre love story with a bit of singing,happy
they really dont make movies like this anymore really should have won best picture oscar ryan gosling was terrific as seb the down on his luck jazz pianist who didnt want to see his treasured music die emma stone was equally terrific as the stereotypical young woman in hollywood trying to catch that one in a million breakthis movie was great because it was refreshing to see hollywood make fun of itself emmas character mia was a jab at the shallowness of the hollywood scene where interview after interview ignore her after a sentence of two see penny in the tv show big bang theory for another jab at hollywood but mia keeps trying to her credit when she meets seb in an onagain offagain relationship its fun to watch the dancing and music scenes are terrific especially the opening famous scene played out on an la freeway  wouldnt anyone in a big traffic jam love to have that entertainmentbut theres a story here too and its very well told dont ever give up on your dreams are your dreams worth sacrificing for love what happens if you move on cant both people in a relationship live their dreams oh the sadness and joy of successis a fantastic movie that you should not miss youll laugh cry and sing the songs for days and days enjoy,happy
somehow i thought ryan gosling wasnt the right guy for the part i liked the music and the staging but the characters and script were not complicated enough and needed another couple or something to play off of the story didnt draw me in as much as i wanted it to not really the actors fault and the movie didnt quite come together enough for me to give it more then a 7 the movie looked difficult to make and that made me love it a lot less however still worth seeing again,happy
i love movie musicals theyre hard to find these days but in their time they were some of the greatest movies made to this day i can sit and watch singin in the rain and never once be bored the mgm musicals of the 50s were some of the most entertaining films ever made there have been others made since that are just as good which brings us to the recently heraldedthe film opens with a huge traffic jam on the la freeway it doesnt take long before someone breaks into song and everyone is out of their cars singing and dancing about the beautiful california sun and how each of them came here with the hope and dream of becoming a star as the music fades the camera pans into one particular car where emma stone as mia is reading through her lines again as she prepares for an audition paying so much attention to them that she fails to move when the traffic lets up behind her ryan gosling as sebastian honks and then swerves around herthis is the first encounter between these two characters dreamers with hopes of making it big of achieving their dreams in a world where everyone wants the same thing stone eventually makes her audition but like all of the rest before its a casting call where tons are seen but few are chosen and she hasnt been chosen yet when not making auditions she works as a barista in a coffee shop on the warner brothers lotdown but not out mias roommates convince her to go with them to a party in hopes of making contacts in the business more singing and dancing follows and mia leaves the party to find her car has been towed walking home she hears a piano playing in a small club enters and sees sebastian at the piano playing something that enchants her unfortunately hes supposed to be playing christmas music and is fired brushing past mia before they can be introducedwe bounce back in time to their earlier encounter and find out about sebastian hes a jazz fanatic and dreams of the day he can open his own club playing real jazz and not some twisted version of it his sister wants him to grow up to date someone and to abandon his dreams for reality but he hangs tough in the meantime to pay the bills he plays in a cover band which happens to be performing at a pool party that mia attends its obvious these two were meant to find one anotherthe chance encounter leads to another song and dance number between the two and off the road to romance they go its a slow beginning with a few hiccups along the way but they do indeed get together finally the question is will they be able to stay together not only that but will they be able to achieve the dreams they both have dreams that everyone who comes here has will they both achieve those dreams and if not what if one rises while the other falls the story seems simple at its base but the ribbons wrapped around it make for a decent light hearted drama many musicals were formed this way as i said i love musicals and when i heard about this one i thought it was a dream come true hollywood returning to a genre thought dead but the end results are mixed for me some will love this film and others hate it i fell in betweenthe imagery on hand here is fantastic at times glimpses of la at its best are mingled with fantasy sequences that stun but at the same time it feels forced a sort of look at me type film that tries so hard but doesnt quite achieve the status of the films it celebrates it isnt one thing that does this either the performances by both stone and gosling are wonderful their singing and dancing numbers together remind you of those old movies and yet i never felt invested in what was going onfor me the weakest part perhaps was the music its not that its bad it just never rose to the classics i remember i didnt hear a song that i knew id be singing in my head later on the lyrics were not the sing song back and forth type from those old movies songs that i can remember to this day here i cant recall many of the lyrics for any of the songs i heard the same holds true for the tunes that those lyrics are wrapped aroundin the end the movie was a fun film to watch it reaches its goal of trying to bring back memories of those bygone days of movie musicals at the same time my guess is it wont ignite a spark in hollywood to make more and thats sad the movie musical deserves to be a genre that carries on to this day if this film doesnt at least inspire someone to make more perhaps it will at least keep it alive with the hopes of their return some day at least it gives us something to enjoy until then,happy
this was an enjoyable dramatic semimusical though too slowmoving and lengthy the last halfhour with mias daydream about what might have been wasnt any good or necessary i could watch the movie again in two or three years doing a lot of fastforwarding memorable acting was done by the two stars the ending should have been after mia is revealed as an unmarried in my version film star and seb as having achieved his dream jazz club they could meet unexpectedly then have a conversation about reestablishing their relationship would they or wouldnt they seb asks should he call her mia smiles friendly but enigmatic the end not to exceed an hour and a half,happy
la la landfinally hollywood has made a film that celebrates frances stuttering sailorsoops apparently the land in the title actually references to tinsel town it selfmia emma stone is a budding actress whose hapless life is constantly intersecting with an aspiring jazz musician sebastian ryan gosling who would rather open his own club than play in his jazzfusion band john legenda relationship eventfully forms between the entertainers and they each help the other attain their dream however their success comes at the expensive of their unique bonda keenly choreographed homage to old hollywood musicals set in the modern era with its contemporary inconveniences this song and dance routine may have a familiar narrative but its reinterpretation is astute albeit saccharine at times career defining performers from both leads and a decent array of melodies further enhance this charmerincidentally insurance doesnt cover injuries obtained dancing in the streets yellow lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,happy
ok so this kind of movie really isnt my thing im certainly not into musicals although i appreciate great acting and great music however i do like jazz so that certainly helped me get something from it if you dislike musicals and jazz id suggest you give this a wide berththe opening part on the freeway and some of the later scenes had me reaching for the sick bagand now a song for no reason staged backdrops and jumping around clich why not make a movie with all the great music but have filmed stage performances and rehearsals instead of interjected and nowa song moments i suppose it wouldnt be a musical but whateverit would never be my goto movie but for some people probably many wives and girlfriends its a nice little comfortblanket escapism piece of enjoyable fluff thats sincere competent and harmless excellently shot directed and acted,happy
la la la laafterwords i left the cinema theater dancing with my girlfriend lifted by a strange feeling that my dancing the film the la la la life is not real anyways movies are not real but part of reality i dislike liking that was a kind of film with all the right musical formulas applied to it but something was wrong see the leading actress emma stone she seemed pretending to be that girl who strives in the artistic lifeline waiting her turn the same happens for the main actor they are good actors the screenplay helped the film to get its end in a professional way in the end a good moral message this total sum is less than its parts why maybe musical films are out of date because our era is an era of breaking stereotypes and most musicals bear lots of stereotypes to watch was like to eat the same favorite sandwich over and over because it feeds you well but you are undernourished sorry is good but after an hour or so you feel kind of hungry,happy
there has been a lot of hype about a modern take on the old style hollywood musical dancing singing and romance with everybody living happily ever after this kind of movie doesnt normally float my boat but damien chazelle the director made the brilliant 2014 hit whiplash so i thought id give it a try i had a smile on my face through most of the movie the songs while not greatly memorable fit the scenes well im more fred ward than astaire so my knowledge of choreography is zip but the dancing seemed fine to me there is a good chemistry between the lead actors played by emma stone and ryan gosling and i think the cinematography is superb the use of colour is fantastic overall not being a lover of musicals i was very surprised by how much i liked it a solid 710,happy
aside from being one of the most genuinely enjoyable movies ive seen in years is a very interesting film without any direct peers although i suppose in a way it is whiplash after anger management it will be interesting to see if damien chazelle has another story in him as others have pointed out its more like jacques demys musicals than anything else but its really not much like those either and nobody under around 50 aside from dedicated musical freaks and faithful attendees at repertory movie houses has seen demy anyway you cant compare to any previous american musical romance not directly the few people ive talked to who say they didnt enjoy the film insist on doing exactly that what chazelle has done is tweak just about every element of the classic formula for the modern audience then integrate those elements into a very modern very emotional storytelling form in doing this hes actually created something entirely new it doesnt matter at all that his leads arent particularly great singers or dancers and it doesnt matter at all that the score is a little thin its the total package that has made this movie such a stunning success with audiences its modern cinematic alchemy which draws on the past glories of the american musical without actually copying them as a film it completely avoids nostalgia even as its lead characters drown in it at times thats quite a trick to pull off just as its a real achievement to employ magical elements like dancing in the stars with a modern audience and not get laughs where you dont want them by current standards virtually all classic american movie musicals are defined by their episodic structure about a month before i saw i saw the tcm revival of singin in the rain which is probably the consensus choice as the most enjoyable musical of the classic era its also one of the very best written but its still a collection of outstanding production numbers linked by a plot that is almost incidental thats perfectly fine and its what we expect from the classic musicals its part of what makes them so much fun is a different kind of fun its all about its own structure it has a storydriven flow to it and is far more dependent on strong acting than the old musicals ever were its not just a matter of removing midcentury corn from the script its built around a very modern form of storytelling that was just starting to emerge around the time musicals went out of fashion it is much more emotional than it is technical in its music and dance as much as in its words and it wouldnt work at all without topflight acting something you definitely cant say about even the greatest classic musicals since its unlikely we are on the cusp of a glorious new age of musicals will likely stand as a singular achievement maybe the most emotionally realistic musical ever while still a total escapist fantasy i find that very often the best films are the ones that had the least chance of getting made its a perfect example of one,happy
i was awaiting this one with rather great tension and i wasnt disappointed in the slightesti will not talk about the musical  story ratio how well written the female main character is or why i slapped the first person who insulted this movie in my proximity what i will say is that i was never touched like this by any other work of art this masterpiece takes itself very very seriously it takes its time to deliver the best paced love story i have witnessed every single act being its own short supported by almost stupidly well written and performed music as well as jokes which werent even remotely out of place additionally and by no means i want to undercut the other actors emma stone delivered a performance which simply blew me away just 10 minutes in i was absolutely convinced this will grant her an oscar thankfully that was eventually the casethe movie is long and the songs require your attention especially when watching in a different language that makes it very hard to endure if you have a short attention span or just didnt enter the cinema with maximum interest to begin within any other case in my opinion this is the movie of the century,happy
what a sweet film like birdman this is a very unique picture that offers something revolutionary to the eyes and earsit fits into the category of complete escapism like in the golden age of cinema if you are looking for a musical with political or social overtones you may be disappointed this is a very simple story about love and following your dreams in hollywood it manages to avoid a lot of the cheesy parts and is not your average musical you see on broadwaythe two leads are brilliant to watch and extremely likable and the production design is breathtakingly beautiful this movie will definitely win a lot of awards ,happy
i always think boxing day is the start of the movie year  the new releases come out and then the award movies leading up to the academy awards well today was new years eve i loved not everyone will my movie partner hated it but to me its much more than a nostalgic tribute to old hollywood musicals that it is but its also touching quirky off beat like the jazz score at times and very contemporaryno spoilers here except to say its a bitter sweet love story judge it for yourself a friend who is not into musicals particularly told me last week that he thought this movie could herald a new wave in musical cinema the way star wars heralded a new genre in sci fi escape movies im not sure but i hope so the world needs to lighten up in these troubling timesit would be difficult to find a more charismatic couple than ryan gosling and emma stone their on screen chemistry at times is mesmerising think vincent minnelli  american in paris  umbrellas of cherbourg and the great musical duos of leslie caron and gene kelly or fred astaire and ginger im talking about chemistry not singing and dancing ability  even though gosling and stone are very talented summing up a joy to watch  unpredictable and very entertaining  academy award worthy and i also liked the music,happy
oscar 17 the best of romantic movie ive ever watched though the movie plot is great but the ending brings out the tears to incomplete love emma stone she deserved the oscar whole movie is so much fantastic with a classic taste ryan gosling in fear of losing the gift of jazz opens a club sebs to fulfill his dream wao im so much amazed anyways this deserved an oscar imdb  9,happy
to be honest this is the best film in the century a story about a girl mia and sebastian who has their own desire their love is also unlike any other couples it is very dramatic exciting lovely though there is a a sad ending but their dream hope desire and dream will be in our heart when i saw it i had to say  i havent had any feeling before when i left the cinema gorgeous a little bit sad but emotional thanks damien chanzelle for making such a masterpiece that make us have to think about love and dream,happy
many audience members and critics have stated that the modern musical is dead while this may have been true for certain films such as mama mia and burlesque this year damien chazelle proved this statement to be falsethis film is about mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling mia is an aspiring actress and sebastian is a passionate jazz pianist the film chronological their relationship as it evolves and changesonce again damien chazelle proves himself a more than capable director this film is perfectly directed with brilliant long takes perfect framing and pitch perfect performances from every single actor involved with the production there are one or two problems with the film however for example the two leads are not perfect musicians their singing voices and dancing abilities are not as perfect as other 1950s musicals that it homages but these problems arent enough to ruin the film for anybodythis is by far one of the best films of the year and if you havent seen it yet i highly recommend that you do so right now,happy
modern day hollywood hype around a certain flick is rarely deserved and i was one of the doubters when it came to 14 fourteen nominations for oscars for a musical to be quite hones i dont like musicals basically i hate them if i exclude the classic ones hair all that jazz i disliked almost every single one of those who roared across kodak theater in the 90s and early 00s ie moulin rouge and chicago hence my skepticism around the much acclaimed and awaited second damien chazelles long feature was really really high and totally undeserved in its nutshell is one perfectly balanced blockbuster although a musical the score doesnt overpower the narrative although lighthearted and cheerful it offers some serious existential questions beneath its surface although serious for a musical it doesnt drown in the darkness of modern day us drama although funny it criticizes both hollywood and the world of music although one great homage to the good old times city of los angeles classical hollywood and jazz it stays way out of the pool of pathetic and tacky thankyou notes all of this thanks to one single man the genius behind the camera young and incredibly talented director and screenwriter damien chazelle taking total control over this vast project he shows off in every single aspect of it nailing the certain golden boys for best directing cinematography editing andproduction design by casting the best available young actress immaculate emma stone he secures the reality of his characters using the male lead best gosling in years to complement her story and the story is really one of those everyone can easily relate to giving the widest possible audience the chance to follow it all the way to the very end ending is a special piece of chazelles art just like the one in his previous indie hit whiplash although a huge musical jazz fan damien doesnt produce movie fairy tales although they certainly look that way in one point or another the ending will lift from its shell of a elaborated romantic comedy to the level of serious drama that will stand the test of time in years to come is the one of the best american movies in this decade and certainly the best musical in this century it will make you laugh cry think over it and talk about it long after you left the cinema just like every great movie in cinema history does,happy
the decision to either abandon ones dream of success in the arts or to compromise ones own artistic vision and modify a dream to conform to someone elses is a heartbreaking and emotionally traumatic moment in the life of a performer and it is during that transitional moment in the lives of two performersan actress and a jazz pianistthat the movie occurs how the two reach that decision how they visualize itand most importantly whether or not they can survive it together as a coupleforms the plot of the pictureand what a picture turns out to bea 128minute swirling colorful explosion of a movie equally brimming with elation and heartbreak drama and comedy but all filled with singing playing and dancing not in movies sincewell maybe ever comparisons to 1985s a chorus line or 2002s chicago or even 1933s 42nd street are inadequate and to measure the film against 1952s classic singin in the rain often considered the best musical ever made is just simply inappropriatestands on its ownit is its own unique exhilarating self even for those of us who dont enjoy musicals is an inspiration because more than about art or music or performance its about life itself you think youve had a bad day take a look at these poor unfortunate souls as they realize they might have squandered their entire lives on a dream no more substantial than a land of lollipops and cotton candy somewhere over a rainbowjust after the movie screen opens up and widens to reveal the picture will be presented in glorious cinemascope the widest and largest film presentation available and in vibrant and breathtaking technicolor the very first scene takes place on a steamy day in a traffic jam outside los angeles one single frustrated driver exits her car and begins to tentatively sing a song about how shes remaining optimistic despite the misery of the daythat solitary driver is soon joined by another driver and then another and another until moments later the entire freeway is filled with a breathtakingly entertaining musical production piece involving hundreds of drivers all performing an optimistic song to a driving tempo while displaying spectacular synchronized jumps and whirls and highsteps in a variety of dance styles its a tough act to followbut as al jolson said in 1927s the jazz singer hollywoods very first musical you aint seen nuthin yet nominally the stars of are the vibrant and lovely emma stone as mia an aspiring actress and the laconic handsome ryan gosling as sebastian a jazz pianist performing for tips in a lunchtime restaurant stone and gosling also teamed effectively earlier in their careers in supporting roles in the 2011 comedy crazy stupid love starring steve carell and julianne moorein stones mia is a young actress toiling as a waitress at an upscale coffee shop mia accepts the slights low tips and casual cruelties of both customers and coworkers with an indefatigable sense of optimism while religiously attending auditions for acting roles when she can find them she believes in her dream and is aggressively pursuing the opportunity that will vindicate her vision and show that all her effort has been worthwhileemma stone with her luminescent eyes and expressive smile opens her heart and shares with the audience nuances of every tiny triumph and discouraging failureher feelings quickly become ours until were praying for her success almost as much as she isgosling as sebastian the jazz pianist turns in a less effecting performance than stone but that might be a subjective pointsome viewers simply dont quite comprehend the actors performance method gosling often appears inarticulate murmuring his dialogue while looking downward or away from the other character then looking up to assess the impact of his lines followed by a wistful smile as if the actors recalling a sweet memory from long ago gosling is effective in his role as sebastian but some of that success is earned as a result of the belief mia places in himwe trust her trustboth gosling and stone however dazzle in their musical scenestheir singing and dancing are impressive and at times exhilarating the canny viewer will notice however that often the dancing is presented in very small segments of two of three seconds duration edited together to create the illusion of one continuous performance its a trick of tom cross expert editing but it works beautifully stone and gosling are not ginger rogers and fred astaire but watching them dancing together youll hardly notice the distinctionbut the real star of is writer and director damien chazelle who also delivered the inspiring and challenging whiplash in 2014 plainly sufficiently inspired by music to largely build his movies around it chazelle is also canny enough to appreciate that the nonmusical sequences are equally important to the overall success of the picture also enormously impressive is justin hurwitz musicwords lyrics and orchestrations if the ballad the fools who dream doesnt draw a tear from the viewers eye call a cardiologist quick the song is delivered by stone toward the end of the picture during the audition that will make or break her career and the wistful delicacy of stones performance of the song nicely summarizes the emotion of every man or woman who knows the feeling of making a decision based on their heart rather than their mindplainly is a movie made by people who love movies for people who love movies proceed with caution see this picture only if you want to be moved as deeply as you want to be entertained,happy
i definitely have to join myself to the multitudes acclaiming as a love letter to hollywood i would just add that its in fact a love letter to the idea of hollywood not the neighborhood from los ngeles full of homeless drug dealers and trannies but that utopian dream factory where love is instantaneous sincere and eternal and where talent with a bit of luck invariably leads to stardom or at least absolute happiness its the same isnt it and when we add the musical numbers the result is a delicate confection which is similar to a cotton candy delicious but almost intangible the difference is that will remain on our palate for a long time due to its sticky songs excellent screenplay and extraordinary visual style in conclusion an unforgettable experience which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation to the fans of cinema and the musicals in general in the leading roles ryan gosling and emma stone display their talent and charisma once more and both form a magnetic couple and then we have the wonderful musical numbers conceived by director damien chazelle and his talented creative team including composer justin hurwitz and choreographer mandy moore not the one you are thinking about from the first seconds of chazelle establishes his amazing vision with a musical number set on a los ngeles freeway during the rush hour and in case that wasnt ambitious enough cinematographer linus sandgren employs a graceful camera which moves through the scenes like one more dancer with fluid and spontaneous movements which hide their careful planning in my humble opinion the camera work of rivals the one of birdman and im not exaggerating i wont reveal the rest of the musical numbers but i will just say that each one of them works perfectly to display the music the actors and of course the city of los ngeles the screenplay is perfectly written and it doesnt only work to introduce the musical numbers because it tells a very interesting story by itself and even though gosling and stone are the absolute owners of the movie i also have to mention the presence of jk simmons rosemarie dewitt and john legend yes the one you are thinking about who bring energy and conviction to their brief roles in conclusion is a brilliant musical movie and as i previously said i recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm and yes we have already understood that chazelle loves jazz his previous film was whiplash i suspect that his secret purpose was implanting that musical style into our heads in which it will remain for many days after leaving the cinema,happy
this is film you go into with a clear mind and let yourself be immersed in its colorful beauty and music this one of my favorite films of 2016 ryan gosling and emma stone have the perfect chemistry on the screen damien chazelle is a rising director with true potential this film has everything music drama romance and comedy the film plays all the right notes at the right time truly a work of art and damien chazelle has wowed me love this movie and most definitely cant wait to buy it on blu ray when it comes out please make sure to check out my full review of on my youtube channel hamstaganza highly recommend to see this film,happy
ever wish there was a movie that didnt involve zombies drug cartels robots or superheroes facing off in a postapocalyptic endofworld scenario it seems more often than not these days that those types of films are taking up all of the theaters at your local movie theater luckily every once in a while we get something different kind and magical this time of year we are so very fortunate to get one of the absolute best films of the year if not in the past several years withdirectorwriter damien chazelle whiplash  10 cloverfield lane has gone back to the music roots and made this ode to the golden age of hollywood musicals but set in present day los angeles with stars emma stone and ryan gosling chazelle really hit home with whiplash but is a more lighthearted take of music and love as a musician gosling and actress stone cross paths in los angeles fall in love and sees if their relationship stands the test of time and fame as both end up making it in their respective fieldsthis film really highlights the talent of chazelle as each dance and music number is perfectly scored choreographed with excellent attention to detail in every moment he pays homage to the old days of cinema without hitting you over the head too often and makes you fall in love with these amazing yet flawed characters gosling and stone deliver outstanding performances and yes actually sang and danced on their own in addition to playing their own instruments the result was simply magical with an excellent jazz score that i cant stop listening tois such a beautiful film that you will be immediately entranced in its brilliance from the first scene which is a onetake scene that was shot on location on a 1oo foot bridge ramp in los angeles with over 100 dancers taking place in the opening musical number in a simulated typical la traffic moment the colors and choreography are just incredible and paves the way for the rest of the film is a perfect blend of comedy drama and music and one breathtaking visual experience after another this film will be watched over and over again for many years to comemustsee,happy
and yes i really do mean everything i have never been so influenced by any movie before its a true masterpiece  not only on acting level but on all levels i dont even know how to begin describing what ive just seen and felt this really does have everything  flawless acting brilliant script incredible cinematography for me it was its idea that grabbed me it is about dreams about life itself it shows how a single choice you make can change your whole life  one wrong move and you will end up leading a life you actually hate one wrong choice and all you have ever dreamed of will stay just a dream and the other way around  portrays the way dreams influence your life if you dare to follow them it simply shows how magically it feels to realize your dreams this movie makes you part of the dream of the magic the happiness the sadness  everything you empathize with the characters every second of the 128 minutes gradually you get more and more involved in this bliss and you dont want it to end not only does this masterpiece inspire you but it also makes you think rarely are there movies that are both meaningful and beautiful  usually its only one of these things it has inspired me to dream really dream and not be afraid of how big or unachievable the dream seems to be at first because this could prevent me from turning it into reality which is one of the best feelings in the world to sum up if you want to feel the magic of a true cinematic masterpiece go see go see emma stone and ryan goslings brilliant acting the genius screenplay and the beautiful work of everyone involved in this movie every second of it is sheer pleasure personally i would be happy if one day i can say that i am a part of the generation  the dreamers who follow their dreams at all cost and arent afraid of failure i sincerely thank everyone involved in this movie for giving it to us pure perfection,happy
whiplash was my favorite film of 2014 it showcased a filmmaker that could control audience emotions with brains tone and brilliant pacing so i was very much anticipating director chazelles return to the big screen with a decided changeofpace that is getting almost universal acclaim and rightfully so where whiplash was an intense drama about ambition and loneliness within the jazz world is bright musical about ambition and loneliness within hollywood fully embracing the constructs of oldfashioned astaire  rogers pictures while floating them effortlessly into the 21st century its a joyous songanddance romcom that dances far beyond its pretenses gosling and stone are phenomenal playing two wideeyed dreamers looking to make something of their artistic abilities with the lovely romantic melancholy of once the dreamlike song numbers of singin in the rain and the character motivations of each the film wraps itself around our nostalgia before nudging us out of our familiar comfort the songs are lyrically moving and readymade for broadway and the sets and dances accompanying them would be considered experimental if they werent so charmingly classic if it seems like skates by on its charisma think again playing effectively with the line between romance and reality both in relationships and in aspirations it asks us if one is inherently better than the other and is it truly possible to have both in our search for purpose must we apologize for every mistake or can we accept them  even love them to quote one song directly heres to the messes we make thats where true love is found thats where life is found,happy
tells a story of seb a jazz pianist struggling to preserve jazz in the modern day and mia an aspiring actress who also works as a barista while waiting for a casting both of them struggle to make ends meet while pursuing their passion they always end up meeting together and the two fall in love while together they were struggling to balance their relationship and pursuing their dreams tells the story of love hope passion and what sacrifices are you willing to make in order to achieve your dreams this movie tells it in a heartwarming and visually pleasing manner that will leave you in tears everything from the opening scene until the ending is amazing the story flows very smoothly providing with amazing visuals that almost hypnotized the viewers side note i am a person who gets easily distracted i have a short attention span usually when im watching a movie my eyes roam around the cinema checking the time on my phone sometimes i even watch my fellow moviegoers but this movie had my eyes glued to the screen the visuals are that good anyways back to the movie the music is also amazing before i watched this movie i am playing the movies soundtrack on spotify on repeat for a whole week im not even into jazz but this movie made me want to listen to jazz music good job seb you are preserving jazz the songs are great and the lyrics go really well with the scene it really sets the mood the movie is trying to portray and the way the actors sang and acted out the song they really stirred up my emotions now to the acting part emma stone and ryan goslings chemistry is undeniable well they wouldnt be paired for the third time if they dont have any chemistry do they the connection between these two is really intense they really made me feel like they were really in love with one another they make want to believe that such love exist and they made me envy them relationshipgoals they are cute funny and madly in love with one another it is a perfect movie with an almost perfect couple,happy
a record breaking haul at this years golden globes awards gives some indication as to just how special a film is with 7 deserved awards including best musical or comedy best director best score and best actor gongs for both its lead stars this has proved to be a powerhouse of cinema which will be remembered for some timedirected by damien chazelle following up on the excellent and critically acclaimed whiplash sees ryan gosling and emma stone deliver performances reminiscent of fred astaire and ginger rogers in this hugely entertaining love letter to the golden age of hollywood and traditional jazz musica comedy romance drama and musical all encompassed into one sublime production we follow jazz musician sebastian gosling and aspiring actress mia stone as they seek to follow their dreams and head down the road of self discovery and sacrifice having previously worked together on the brilliant crazy stupid love and notsobrilliant gangster squad the chemistry between the leads is palpable as they embark on a blossoming romance and enable each other to pursue their own ambitionsthis idea of following ones dream encapsulates the very essence of the movie and it is a theme enhanced by the majestic fantastical and dreamlike world which chazelle has created for his protagonists a beautifully crafted stage on which possibilities are endless if you persevere indeed this hollywood that chazelle portrays is encased in a sense of nostalgia and romance for the lost magic of what music and movies were all about art forms within which anything can happen and anything can be created such is the nostalgia here chazelle even filmed in widescreen cinema scope as a deliberate homage to the style and feel of the movies from the 50s and earlier there are references to this bygone age too with mia discussing how she grew up watching classics like casablanca and bringing up baby she even works at warner brother studios where parts of the film take place and classic sets from vintage movies are seen sebastian meanwhile complains that jazz is dying in a plea for this particular art to be saved yet struggles to make it relevant for a modern audience he is asked how can you be a revolutionary when you are such a traditionalist and it is a question which was perhaps considered by chazelle when creating this homage to a mainstream audiencethis vintage style is evident throughout the film and especially in the sporadic musical sequences in which gosling and stone were mesmerising as they performed their dance routines and songs with hugely impressive assurance and skill whereas goslings singing voice is perhaps on the weaker side his delivery was perfectly befitting of the character he portrays whilst stone was utterly captivating in all of her routines but particularly during her solo towards the end of the movieboth sebastian and mia are such likable characters who complement each other so well that they add a huge element of charm to an already uplifting premise its near impossible not to root for the both of them and support them as they pursue their dreams and as such its heartbreaking when we witness the sacrifices they have to make in order to do so it is here the dramatic element comes into play ensuring never becomes too saccharine or twee it could have been easy for chazelle to get lost in a world of fantasy and endless opportunity but he reigns in the nostalgia and the sentiment by bringing his characters back down to earth and reminds us that following ones dream is not easy nor simple but that it takes hard work perseverance compromise and of course sacrifice credit is therefore heaped further on gosling and stone who put sebastian and mia through a rollercoaster of emotions throughout as they celebrate their successes feel humiliated at their failures and laugh and cry together perhaps the most heartening aspect of all is the way in which they support and encourage each other and refuse to let each other ever give up on their dreams its a hugely inspiring notioncomplimenting this degree of restraint which chazelle imposes on his protagonists both gosling and stone deliver perfectly pitched and understated performances which also serve to enhance the sheer scale and scope of not just the musical sequences but the production as a whole this is perhaps epitomised by the very opening sequence a singletake shot of an entire freeway traffic jam breaking out into a fanfare of song and dance which sets the standard for the rest of the film catchy music sublime choreography and the panning out of the freeway in order to fit in the vast los angeles landscape hints at the grandiose nature of the productionthe music that is played throughout is not to be ignored justin hurwitz had teamed up with chazelle on whiplash and returns here with a score and soundtrack that brings to life for a musical there are not actually that many song and dance routines but music as a medium is a pivotal and consistent theme here and one that chazelle ensures is not lost amongst the hollywood nostalgia the choreography also deserves a mention for enabling some truly memorable scenes none moreso than sebastian and mias first dance together in a setting which truly embodies the library of classics which chazelle is paying tribute toperfect performances including solid support from the likes of jk simmons and john legend fantastic routines and wonderful music all combine to tell a relatable message delivered by superbly written characters which serves to make one of the most enthralling magical and enjoyable pieces of cinematic escapism and entertainment in yearsfor further movie reviews please visit httpswwwfacebookcomjmcreelreviews,happy
the pace was so annoying and the plot got too complicated and i just think its boring i really wanted to like this and im having a hard time rating this its just not what i expected and i am just so dissapointed i love the message about sticking to your dream and the movie portrayed it well just in a kind of annoying wayi dont know how to explain it with words,happy
just didnt get it every cliche from every film ever im a huge fan of musicals  but the music is mor and the singing isnt great dancing  meh and as for a plot why oh why was this nominated for so many oscars maybe because its about hollywood having recently seen the greatest showman recently why hasnt this been nominated for more huge injustices and understanding about what makes a good musical with the oscars although they didnt get west side story wrong or the sound of music if you like music dont waste your time,happy
i have just watched this film and honestly found it to be stunning the cinematography was wonderful the music breathtaking and the songs both fun and emotional ryan gosling as always played his character very well and clearly put his all into it especially learning how to play the piano for the role excellent casting in both ryan and emma and i thought their singing and dancing was good i truly enjoyed this film and find it very frustrating reading comments from those know it all kudos wanting reviewers who say that anyone who likes this film is a sheep everyone is different and has different tastes  one mans trash is another mans treasure life would be so boring if everyone was the same why does everything have to be compared to something else why cant it just be enjoyed for what it is,happy
damien chavelles  is a movie which has rightfully won many awards for its cinematography acting and music it feels as though each note thread and camera angle were delicately and thoughtfully chosen to bring together a story about two people fighting to make their dreams come true as well as fighting to be together mia an aspiring actress from boulder city soon falls in love with a snappy jazz pianist sebastian who tries to revive the art of jazz there are many scenes in which lighting plays an important role in adding to the mood of each scene as well as creating a beautiful visual composition when sebastian plays the piano and mia hears him for the first time the moment is intensified with a spotlight with the use of a spotlight nothing else mattered except the two of them in the moment the lighting also ties in with the use of colors used and how the colors would mix to add to a scene the lighting is used in order to make certain scenes stand out from others such as when sebastian and mia have their fight or when they sit down to sing a song together at the piano the same lighting is used after mia does her solo performance some scenes were filmed with only natural light to give it a more realistic feeling although most of the film had a formalist feel it did indeed had realistic elementsprimary colors were used throughout this movie to convey a certain emotion for a particular scene blue was used to express success and control such as when she decides to go to the party with her roommates although the other girls are wearing bright primary colors they still fade into the background of the party whereas mia stands out foreshadowing that she has more potential and will stand out yellow was used to signify that there would be some sort of change to follow such as the dance that sebastian and mia share after the pool party or keith bumping into the couple at the jazz club the absence of color also plays an important role in the building of the story such as the scene where mia botches her solo performance and after sebastian goes through a humiliating photo shoot the two of them are wearing black and white when they individually hit rock bottom the music and dance numbers were used to allude to classic musicals as well as tie the entire story together sebastian theme shows up a number of times throughout the film as a way to ground the characters or make them reminisce about how things were by the end of the film when mia and her husband happen to go to sebastians jazz club the audience gets somewhat sucked into the idea of exclusionary musical art being trained throughout the movie that jazz and classical is better than modern pop at the pool party the audience is able to feel sebastians embarrassment when hes asked to play i ran they are also able to feel a shock and almost disgust when sebastian first starts to play with keiths band the cinematography used in this film was used for the specific purpose of making it feel like old hollywood by using cinemascope most of the dancing scenes were filmed as if the camera was moving with the music like an instrument spinning and moving in and out the camera moves in an almost emotional way and goes along with the feelings of the scene altogether the film was very well thought out and with that it was able to grab the attention of a larger audience with a good outcome,happy
is an amazing movie and easily one of my alltime favorites there is a heavy amount of importance placed on colors throughout the film often used to portray character emotion or to foreshadow the outcome of imminent events though the color foreshadowing was occasionally intentionally misleading making the movie all the more fun there were many scenes in the movie where extremely vibrant colors were brought to the foreground to really deliver an effective message or emotion there was also a plethora of scenes that used color as a mood modifier in the background so that it doesnt jump out at you nearly as much as the foreground color placement but so that it still has an amazing impact setting this apart from all other movies released in 2016 i very much enjoyed the use of camera angles throughout this movie more often than not they were used to portray a lighthearted sarcastic tone to scenes that could have otherwise felt dry this effect is present so much that without it i doubt the main characters would have found any interest in each other camera angles also provided the obvious added bonus of making you feel those emotional scenes all that much more especially when combined with the movies again excellent use of color i enjoyed the use of far shots to make you feel disconnected from the characters emotionally there are very few in this movie but they are used extremely well another stand out example of the amazing camera angle usage in this movie is the panoramic shot of the female protagonist during her final interview which truly gave the emotion of a transformation occurring the turning over of a new leaf in a sense as her life really started to take off in the direction she had always hoped it would there seems to have been significant effort put in to making every scene as perfect as it could be it feels as though a lot of time went into making sure that every scene had exactly the setup to deliver the message exactly as it was intended the whole movie gives the feeling of well watching a movie this is shown in the way that things come up in the order that they feel they should even to a comedic affect at times and the often times extravagant scenes or props for example when the protagonist couple is leaving the coffee shop and walks into a movie set setup right next to the coffee shop the set is comedic in both its placement and lack of dramatic introduction its not exactly a defining moment in the movie but the scene is referred to and referenced at later points in the movie this gives it the backing to have justified receiving a moment of individual introduction instead it like many other sets throughout the movie are introduced in a lackluster kind of fashion which helps to lend to the almost constant sarcastic undertone of the movie in a spectacular way i would highly recommend that anyone who hasnt already go see this movie asap,happy
i have never seen before but i had heard mixed reviews after finally seeing it almost a year late i must express that exceeded my expectations and literally blew me away the main female lead mia played by the brilliant emma stone works at a coffee shop on a movie set in la dreaming of landing a role in hollywood someday the male lead sebastian played by ryan gosling dreams of owning a jazz club trying to make sure jazz will not die with the older generation they set out on their dreams together while being romantically involved the story of mia and sebastians adventures teaches us that youre never too old to chase your dreams and that giving up when you fail is not an option overall i thought the plot was pretty basic and clich however the chemistry between stone and gosling was memorable the determination of the characters trying to chase their dreams gave the audience a heartfelt story and definitely was an all around feel good movie is a modern spin off of our favorite classical musicals singin in the rain casa blanca and many others as a musical theatre enthusiast i enjoyed the filmmakers choices to make an ode to the originals connecting to classic musical films spoke to younger generations in a way to show them that the oldies shaped modern musical theatre into what it is today the production design for the movie was absolutely brilliant the use of vibrant colors through costumes and lighting brought the story to life the main color choices of red yellow and blue grabbed the audiences attention and made each scene stunning the choreography in each dance number was lyrical and stylized again brought the story to life it made it seem as if i wasnt in class watching the film i was actually there much credit given to the choreographer for putting on the most memorable dance number of the film the opening scene another day of sun the accuracy of synchronization made the number exciting upbeat and concrete overall i was very impressed with the film i thought the plot was good the songs were classical and the colors were vibrant would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys musical theatre ,happy
musicals arent for everyone i certainly thought they werent for me however struck a chord with me it was capable of maintaining an unoriginal story with stereotypical characters while still being memorable and dare i say phenomenal it did this through the intense use of colors to express distinct emotions during just about every scene in the movie as well as acting as a homage to several older movies and the styles they were made in can be described as a drama with comedic elements and a strong reliance on musical scenes it follows mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling two dreamers in a land full of opportunists yet lacking opportunity their drive to accomplish their goals is what brings them together yet also drives them apart the impossible goal that is achieving ones dreams and keeping ones relationships in the land of dreamers is shown in dazzling color through the story of in the end the very thing that brought mia and sebastian together is what breaks them apart yet id argue its the best possible ending for both of them both professional dreams had been achieved and all that remained was one last glimpse into what could have been for better or for worse the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of for me is color the movie is colorful in so many different and amazing ways not only is it the best use of color ive seen in a movie but its what grabbed my attention immediately even the opening scene of the movie was vibrant full of motion and color it was the epitome of memorable as louis giannetti states about color in his book understanding movies its strongly emotional in its appeal expressive and atmospheric rather than intellectual is made to invoke an intense emotional response from the viewer and it subconsciously influences us into this response through the use of color the atmospheric use of color in the movie is particularly incredible examples include the green backlighting in the dinnerfight scene with a strong yellow glow on both the actors normally both of these colors would invoke more positive feelings such as yellow bringing joy and happiness or green meaning loyalty and trust however this scene turns those on their heads it uses them for the opposite and the effect is jarring yet memorable this continues into the scene outside the theater after mias onewoman show that sebastian missed theyre surrounded by a bright pink light that fits into the surroundings but not the mood it brings an almost ridiculous air to the scene that further enhances the intensity of the fight it is a very jarring effect thats utilized extremely well in these moments and is one i was not familiar with prior to viewing this film of course there is also a very consistent theme throughout the movie using lighting and color or lack thereof several times the camera zooms in on a character while all the lights but those pointed directly at the person of interest fade to black this is an example of emphasis through lighting albeit an extreme one it works due to the already formalistic nature of the film and in many cases highlights the intense emotions a scene is trying to conveyin addition to the incredible use of color to make the film truly pop loves to include references to old films not only that but it was also shot in cinemascope a popular filming method in the 50s and 60s it truly immerses itself in the culture of those movies and that allows it to play off their tropes in a new and refreshing way its a modern masterpiece of just clich enough to not be clich examples of the references would include the multiple nods to singin in the rain like near the beginning during mia and sebastians duet where he spins around a lamp pole as well as a very literal reference to rebel without a cause a film from 1955 which was screening during their first date it also had some scenes shot at the griffith observatory which was visited in a subsequent scene is a movie about movies and as such has much more room and credibility when it comes to using countless movie references it just fits the story makes it more interesting and provides extra layers for the audience to pick apart one last interesting part about is the variety of shots and filming techniques used throughout the movie the most interesting one in my opinion was the reliance on what seemed like handheld or at least shaky to slightly shaky cam footage during the more intense scenes in the movie it provided a sense of realism to them completely separate from the mostly formalistic design of the movie throughout it relies heavily on the use of expression through color and music and often times places them in what could be considered ridiculous situations to start breaking into song and dance granted this comes with being a musical but it was capable of breaking away to a more realistic style when it needed to through the use of its filmingis truly a masterpiece is my eyes and one that i wished i had watched sooner its use of color lighting camera movements and nods to classical cinema are what bring it its intense emotion charm and memorable story its capable of taking something unoriginal and reinventing it using old techniques and clichs something that i have never seen before and never considered could be done,happy
is without a doubt one of the best technical films ive ever seen theres so much going on minutiae youd miss after three or four viewings for instance notice how emma stones character is pretty much without makeup through the whole movie its jarring given weve seen her wearing makeup heavily through much of her career here we see her raw and clear until she becomes a movie star then suddenly its the emma we know wearing makeup and more artificially beautiful because of itstarts with a big happy musical number that doesnt fit in and i think is the weakest part of the whole film it sets the optimistic and glamorous tone but has no bearing on the story as it goes along through the first twenty or so minutes we see mia emma stone living a fantasy life essentially doing everything she can to make it big in hollywood while making coffee for the stars everything is bright and colorful the music is reminiscent of the golden age of hollywood musicals its a fun timecut to sebastian ryan gosling and his mundane poor uninteresting life hes basically in the same boat as mia theyre both struggling to make it in hollywood him in music she in acting but the colors of the film are more subdued here theres not a bright palette and the scenery isnt dreamlike and fake he lives in the real worldit takes a little while before these two characters get together but when they do the film is wonderfully whimsical and almost satirical my favorite moment of the first half is when emma stone just happens to have tap dancing shoes in her bag for a big musical number the movie knows the tropes and does everything it can to either subvert them or make a joke of themthe romance is wonderfully human with great chemistry between gosling and stone theyre funny and likable awkward and sweetand then the movie begins to turnla la lands final act is not forcibly depressing but it does bring the fantastical down to the human level again it goes from a tale of romance and chasing your dreams to how attaining your dreams mean giving up the things you love selling out the final montage a beautifully realized and extremely effective culmination of every emotion in the movie is a middle finger to convention as well as a reflection on all the choices we make in life that have left us in the predicaments we are in everyone has wondered what their life would be like had they done a b c etc its a touching finish because it subverts our expectations for this type of movie while also applying that subversion to our own livesanother piece of the film i loved was the jazz storyline how sebastian was forced to sell out to the modern jazz he seems to have disdain for in order to make a living its an interesting case of selling out thats handled extremely well mia doesnt mind the music and i would go so far as to say that john legends song in the film a modern jazz tune is the best piece in the whole movie but while the movie is celebrating classic jazz it also celebrates the idea of metamorphosing jazz to fit with the modern dayis actually my favorite movie of the year so far and i cant stop humming some of the music it sticks with you long after watching and is so packed with exceptional technical prowess that you cant help but be enchanted by the films spell the script the music the cinematography the sets the costume design the acting it all combines to create a movie that is both a throwback to classic hollywood romance and musical films while subverting every expectation and bringing them to a human and realistic level its an absolute masterpiece of a film,happy
i was eager to see this movie after hearing it had won so many oscars but it left my local movie house too soon and all 18 of my public librarys dvd copies of the film were checked out with a waiting list over a month long so i rented a copy and am quite glad i didnear the very beginning this movie has a scene that tells you that expected reality will be occasionally dismissed in favor of music and dance as hundreds of cars become temporarily halted on one of las multilane trafficways those of us whove driven there know thats realistic one person gets out and starts dancing and soon that serves as the catalyst to prompt 100s of others to do the same thing pure fantasythe primary characters are mia emma stone and seb ryan gosling emma is an aspiring actressplaywright who temporarily works as a barrista in a coffee shop until she can get her break seb is a jazz pianist in a club where hes forced to play the kind of music he doesnt like so he aspires to own his own club in which he can feature the kind of music he favors the two meet develop into a romantic couple consoling and finding various ways to support andor rescue each other when needed they each do finally get their big break  emma as the lead in a movie thatll be filmed in paris and seb in a traveling band that pays him enough to accrue enough money to start his own club in lalala land la is a play on la for los angeles has lots of spots where the viewer must infer what is happening or has happened because we dont see it unfold or be dramatically portrayed in the film eg when mia is shown back in la from paris with a child and a husband whos not seb that suddenly strikes us viewers that the miaseb relationship wont be one in which theyll live happily together ever after with her husband mia  seb do later meet in sebs new apparently successful club comfortably  briefly acknowledging each other but continuing on in their separate ways no doubt privately grateful for the role the other did play in bringing each to their new levels but thats also quite realistic isnt it  i think many of us are grateful for how our loves in the past have helped us to go on to new levels so perhaps this lala land will prompt other film makers to experiment with finding new ways of combining music  dance with human hopes and more realistic outcomes,happy
is a great and beautiful made movie i love the sets the outfits the scenery the lighting the colors the cinematography basically all the things you see in the movie are gorgeous to look at the soundtrack is marvelous what an excellent job did justin hurwitz emma stone is a brilliant actor and really showcases her talents in and while theres nothing wrong with goslings performance his character isnt exactly written to be as emotional and expressive so its fine be me usually i dont really like musicals but this one is it an exception in the end even with the negative comments of movie einstein puristsetc in my opinion it is worth watching trust me,happy
technically is a flawless movie the visuals the cinematography the performances the costume design and music are all really neat however beneath that thin veneer of cinematic perfection lies a flat and unoriginal storyit seems as if critics who praised this movie spent too much time ogling the gorgeous visuals while simultaneously ignoring the plotthe plot is the same old trite story about a man and a woman who meet and fall in lovetheres nothing brilliant or unique about this concept this story could have easily been told straight without all the theatrics but then it probably wouldnt have gotten an oscaris a disappointingly bland musical with an ending that not only makes you feel hollowed inside but also like the whole experience was a waste of time,happy
ok that title might seem like clickbate  but it isnt ill get back to the title in a second but first a quick reviewif your looking for the second coming of singing in the rain is not it but that doesnt mean that its a bad movie in fact its quite wonderful but in a more subtle umbrellas of cherbourgthe young girls of rochefort wayits colorful captivating and engaging my only real complaint is it needs one more big number about 34 of the way in there is a long stretch of the film without any singingback to the title of this review ill put a link below to a filming location video on youtube that shows the house in the dream sequence that sebastian and mia live at  in real life has swastikas all over it im not sure if any swastikas made it into the actual film pretty weird righthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvl4gxz0qbyf8,happy

la la lands opening musical number is perhaps its most incredible moment being so catchy and beautifully filmed so as to immediately impress and engage any viewer who doesnt outright despise musicals the amusing thing is that this scene could be cut from the film and have absolutely no impact on the story it is purely for show but what a show it is this element of showiness is true for much of the film which is certainly no insult given how impressive such a classical spectacle is in our current cinematic landscape that is almost completely devoid of such things its rare to see a musical released to the silver screen that isnt animated a parody a remake or an adaptation and that alone makes this film noteworthy the fact that it is put together with tremendous talent and care also helpsalmost every aspect of this film is executed with great flair and confidence the cinematography is beautiful the singing and dancing are fun wellchoreographed and varied in style the music in and of itself is enjoyable and a perfect fit for the story and tone the overall aesthetic is evocative of a colorful quasifairytale world the characters are developed thoroughly and compellingly the acting of the two leads is great romantic clichs youd expect are present but the strength of the overall product makes them forgivable and the story itself is a wellcrafted vehicle for all of these things to work in tandem directed with great confidence and stylish precision the lynchpin for it all being the classic simple theme of pursuing ones dreams though admittedly if youre the type of person who is cynical about the film industry then the constant brighteyed hollywood worship may get pretty grating for youthe ending is where the movie either makes its mark or misses it depending on your interpretation without going into much detail it involves a beautifully clever musical sequence juxtaposing fantasy and reality which i think most will agree is a highlight of the film however following this sequence the film ends very abruptly which is jarring it felt to me like it lacked the last ounce of closure needed to bring everything home instead leaving a hollow indecisive feeling in its wake perhaps this was precisely the intention but it seemed out of place in a story that was otherwise mostly light fun and easy to digestthat said by breaking away from expectations the film is likely to make a more lasting impression on the viewer in a way this actually elevates the material from an objective filmmaking perspective as opposed to being predictable and derivative though whether it works for you or not will largely depend on whether you come into looking for fantastical reality or realistic fantasy,happy
i guess the movie is so great because of the ending we all have a time in our lives in which we made the career or love related decision that changed completely the course of our lives i know i had one actually i had several like we all do but there is this special one and this is what this movie is about those last 20 minutes when they replay the whatcouldhavebeenbutneverwas are perfectly made that one last look between the two main characters is  i am actually out of words to describe it watch it you wont regret it o,happy
once in a while this happens a film that does everything well enough to avoid major criticism the perfect blockbuster according to the book of david oselznick a few things are requireda pair of lovable and bankable stars girl and boy that have the sympathy of a majority of the filmgoers even some people who dont go so often to films but recognize them as stars they have to be given roles that fit their mold where they can act as lovable as everyone expect them to begive the film a storyline as easy to follow as possible a simple romance that holds all the plot points that will make it look as something big and breathtaking aquaitance fall in love crisis redemptionput that storyline in the context of a bigger theme and twist it in a way that will ultimately prevent the lovers from the desired happy end this is melodrama where the bigger context affects the smaller lives war in gone with the wind religious prejudice and politics in benhur the shipwreck in titanic in this case we have hollywood and a simple dynamic of love vs the pursuit of dreamsproduce the whole thing as lush as you can and as likable as the pair of stars colorful saturated photography songs everyone can easily hum dance numbers that tap into the memory of older loved musicals competent and safe craftsmanshipsell the whole thing invest as much or more selling the thing as in producing itthe selfreference here is obvious and falls along two lines both equally safe and obviousthe movie is set in movieland she even serves coffee in a movie studio it works the most ostensibly artificial film genre of them all and in the way makes obvious and safe quotes of classical musicals plus the rebel even more obvious bits among those quotes is one where they walk through the 4th wall and we get to see the whole film crew equipment lights etcthe jazz bits our boy is a conservative jazz fan the bop guy who thinks miless fusion is rock or pop or whatever so are the people behind this film or so they show themselves to be this film is supposed to stand for the new films as old jazz stands for new jazz genuine and true by comparisonthe by now very celebrated ending with the alternative version where the two lovers stay together is the ultimate safety device employed they sink the ship and kill jack but just think that maybe the viewers will be put away and so they relive an alternative version of the last third of the movie and film in a few minutes crammed with music and narrative information the script draft that was thrown in the garbage for the sake of the tragic element of grand love themed blockbusterif you want a film that is well crafted escapism while seeming more than that this is it this is being canonized by hollywood and for years to come you will hear bits of the music in academy awards ceremonies and see it in lists of best of etc but if you want adventure if you want risk than this is the total opposite its obscenely safe and ultimately pointless this is the cinematic version of marsalis sailing competently and expertly through the seas that others have charted long ago kind of a cinematic version of a tribute band i think im going to hear a miles record after writing thisps  this rather conservative effort is as i write ranked 57th on the top250 list in imdb at the same time trump is sitting in the white house birdman is now past its adventure over in a few decades america and the world by default will observe this and maybe process how mainstream poorconservative storytelling habits correlates to political manipulation of the masses,happy
you would think considering the almost hysterically positive reviews that the new citizen kane had been released withi very much liked this film a toetapping sundrenched thoroughly entertaining ode to the musicals of yesteryear with a modern twist in the inventive dance numbers and slyly adult song lyricsryan gosling and particularly emma stone are on ripe breezy fun form and clearly relish playing opposite each otherthe photography and lighting are stunning showing off the varied colour schemes throughouti just felt a better more subtle marriage of the light musical and heavy dramatic moments was needed to meld all the wonderful elements together,happy
i must admit that musicals are not my choice of genre but i went into this with an open view given its feedback i had high expectations despite not being my usual cup of tea but must admit that throughout the majority of the film i wasnt blown away it was quirky and fun and both emma stone and ryan gosling were great as expected but the first act was drawn out and it didnt do much to distinguish itself from any other romance film the opening sequence was also far too high school musicalglee for my taste and i found it hard to take to seriously after this that being said it recovered well and actually the end sequence was a pleasant surprise and done in spectacular fashion whereas the observatory scene seemed out of place when the pair began flying through the room the dreamsequence at the end was a great way of emphasizing the passion of their relationship and really hit the spot as it left viewers knowing what could have been it was also refreshing to see a film of this genre wrap up without the clich goto happy endingbut the biggest feeling that i was left with after leaving the cinema was whether it needed to be a musical obviously the intention was to be a musical but i feel the film would have been just as much a success without the few average songs the songs really did not stand out and bring much to the film other than break up its flow and i would be surprised if any are remembered ten years down the line this was certainly no grease or moulin rouge but is almost as good a film for the reasons beyond the music again this is just my view and is probably so because its not my typical genre but i would be intrigued to see what others think of whether this movie took the best direction it could,happy
has been winning all the plaudits recently with almost everyone and their dog singing its praises pun intended it also cleaned up at the golden globes and will likely do the same at the oscars unless there is a backlashim going to take the contrary position and tell you that i dont agree i liked it as a film but think it would have been better without the set piece bits that make it a musical im not saying there shouldnt have been any music in it quite the opposite the music in the film that is performed in jazz clubs and concerts is excellent and fits into the story perfectly there is even a version of city of stars sung in the main characters apartment that advances the story the city of stars motif recurs throughout the film and is a fabulous piece of music but there are about six sections in the film where the characters sing and dance rather than have a normal conversation i think that these sections could be cut and it would make it a better film even if they are not replaced with anythingjust my view admittedly im not a fan of musicals i rated it 710 it would probably have been a 910 if it wasnt for those six or so musical sections,happy
hollywood always loves a good story about itself whether its the fall from graces mystery of sunset boulevard the tongueincheek satire in singin in the rain or the sophisticated translation of the artist follow this tradition its a wonderful film that needed an editor hence why i gave it a 7 even though i think there is so much to lovethe film stars two young dreamers in sebastian wilder ryan gosling and mia dolan emma stone wilder is a struggling musician who is a rarity in the city of angels a native angelino he drives a older convertible which fits his persona he was born in the wrong decade he sneers as he sees his city gentrify and much of the older culture vanish he dreams of owning a jazz club as he himself looks for any opportunity to make a quick buck whether thats playing christmas standards as a lounge player assisting an 80s cover band at parties or touring with a pop band that stands for everything hes against dolan on the other hand is like many in the city from elsewhere a native of a small town in nevada dolan drops out of school to become a barista aka actress while frequenting auditions that go nowhere naive and hopeful shes the counterbalance to wilders cynicism and pessimism they immediately connect on one particular thing pursuing their dreams i think that gosling and stone have excellent chemistry i see some people complaining about that and i have no idea what movie they were watching as i thought their romance was genuine and real unlike most we see in filmtelevision i loved the magic the film had reminding us of what great cinema can do in taking us to another world appearances by jk simmons john legend and others provide great additional support to the film the music is beautiful and will stay with you for a long long time from the high energy opening number which sets up perfectly for someone coming to la for the first time to city of stars that encapsulates what we think of when we think of hollywood another thing i see people complaining about are the numerous party scenes as someone who lived in la for a while as a starving artist i can attest that yes this film captured them perfectly most of them are insufficient and very rarely does anything happen at them that causes anything important thats why i think the film does a great job at making them seem unimportant they pretty much are yet artists in the city go to them with the hopes that maybe itll be the one thatll change everythingi have one major beef with the film but its a big one the editing was bad there are scenes that point to future scenes but sometimes these scenes lead to nothing which makes me wonder why they were still in the film also i think cutting about 30 minutes off of the film would have made it better it got long in certain parts and i think you could have made it about 90 minutes and it still would have been an excellent film gives me hope like those of new citizens of la hoping to make it in acting or directing or writing or music or comedy etc damien chazelle is a very talented and young filmmaker who has given us now three excellent films maybe he can lead a new revolution for film in hollywood similar to what happened in the 90s when filmmakers like fincher payne tarantino lee singleton ritchie gave us really creative and groundbreaking original work its desperately needed in superherosequelreboot obsessed hollywoodi recommend and call it a 910 star movie trapped in a 7 star film that needs an editor and some polish,happy

its so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasnt animated emma stone and ryan goslin light up the screen the songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops i think the people that are so angry about the hype this film has gotten forget that the musicals it mimics had pretty basic plots oh so its the worst film of the year really this is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim the production numbers are sappy to be sure but thats what this kind of offering puts to us it tells us that we can just have fun and root for the characters,happy
i didnt like the movie one of the most overrated movies ive ever seen although we must pay tribute to marketers and all those who made so much hype aroundyou may love the picture in several cases youre 14 yo or so for you the form is more important than the content youre a fool who dreams objectively film has both positive and negative sides thats why my rating is 510 not 110 but unfortunately many viewers and even critics were guided by emotions rather than common sence while rating,happy
made quite a splash after it debuted its now on imdbs top 250 and received 6 oscars but with all that publicity it might just leave you feeling like methats it is a decent film but hardly a great filmthe story is of two struggling artistsone an actress emma stone and another a jazz musician ryan gosling each appears ready to give up their beloved craft after years of disappointments and billsand that is when they both meet and fall in love ultimately however their careers do take off and this leads you to wonder if they can make it together after all being a famous actress or musician isnt exactly parttime workin many ways this film reminds me of the ending in the umbrellas of cherbourg this sort of downbeat ending didnt really bother meit was realistic but somehow muddled it all upand left you with a confusing ending that probably was like umbrellasbut maybe wasnt i found this to be a huge problem aside from this i also was not a huge fan of the charactersthough i must admit it did leave me mistyeyed more than a few times well worth seeingbut a film that isnt perfectand youd expect a six oscar film to be absolutely perfect,happy
questions our definition of happiness and fulfillment at the end did he look happy on stage did she while both thought that becoming a famous actress or a jazz bar owner were their lifes purpose was it worth it when they lost each other in the process in the dream sequence he wished he had just kissed her when she approached he wished he had never taken his eyes off her when offered the band he realized that his true fulfillment was to come through true love had he stayed true to his art and classical jazz he still could have pursued his dream in paris and even make enough to build his dream bar oneday say the same five year it took him when she pushes him to pursue his dream rather than mess about with people he does not like and music that does not mean anything to him he questions her motive attributing her endeavor to keep him true to his path to something so demeaning as jealously was the gross mistake and caused an irreparable crack in their relationship if nothing else than at least in her image of him dr victor e frankl once wrote that our search for meaning comes through 3 things work love and strength in the face of adversity the writer wants to drive home the point that nothing should ever prevail over true love because even when you will have everything you desired you will look across at each other and long and think what if,happy
im letting life hit me until it gets tired then ill hit back its a classic ropeadope spoken like a master of perseverance the film took some time for me to understand that the film was more than just a musical the opening scene with the cars on the highways reminded me that the movie was a musical with creativity but as the movie progressed i got to see some great character development through not only the music but the dialogue and the environment the characters were in the emotions the film gave me not only were saddening but influenced me to stick to my dreams to the very endthe film is about a pianist and an actress who hope to fulfill their dreams through hard work in a modernday setting through their long journey in the stunning city of hollywood california they meet each other and find love in both their support for each other and the bond that is created i think the films plot is very realistic with the characters having up and downs and trying find purpose in the mystery of life can be described as a piano with many keys because there are so many elements that make this film greatthe character development is what makes this film memorable and authentic at first sight we see the two main characters on a highway was of chaos with no intentions of meeting anyone then we start to learn who mia and sebastian are as the movie goes on we eventually learn that although they have many differences they both have the same dream of persevering through their hardships to get what they want mias example of this can be seen when she gets some of her earlier call backs for acting in each call back scene we see she is set back multiple times however through her endurance she got the acting job sebastian does this by finally opening his dream club for authentic jazz listeners and players another thing they share is understanding that sometimes to achieve your goal you just need a little push from someone else both characters kept one another on the path to their dreams sebastian made sure mia went to her big call back about her story while mia made sure sebastian didnt sell himself out for what other people wanted i think this is what really drives the film to have great characters developmentone strong element the film use of colors the colors are unrealistically bright and serve a great purpose in the plot for example when mia and sebastian are arguing about their two contrasting ideas on how they should deal with what they want we see two complementary which help in creating a visible tension among the two characters each color is a separate being with its own ideas i think the director distinctively uses colors is to acknowledge that colors can be mixed to create a new color or relative to what the movie is about two different dream can create something extraordinary the end scene was incredible and made me a little emotional it allowed me to understand what was all about it revealed that this movie is about understanding that each path you take in life will have its own rewards and setbacks but once you make those decisions there are no doovers so you should make the best out of the decisions you make the character mia really encourages this idea when she has the dream of her and sebastian living life together when she sees him in the jazz club at the end of the film i start to want their fantasy to become reality but then realize that even though it seems like the right thing to do according to the plot i understand that they are both happy and content with the decisions henceforth gives the film the name understanding that we must be happy in the real world and not dwell in the fantasy we wish was real,happy
is a very good film there is a number of film techniques that are used to create an overall great movie an important aspect of the film is the set design with vibrant bright colors it contributes to the classical film noir with the great cinematography and an array of shoots including close ups and establishing shots we can see how the set design contributes to the expressionistic aspect of this classically composed film the cinematography is great especially with each scene having a different feel from the large portfolio of almost every imaginable film technique used another important aspect of the film is the melodrama between protagonists the intense emotions can really appeal to the viewer and have a significant impact with reference to many golden age films we can see a modern interpretation of a classical film the production design is a very important aspect of the film with color being an important symbol and how it symbolizes the intense emotions thought the film definitely deserved the award for production design with both realistic and expressionistic story telling the film appeals greatly to almost every viewer lastly the staging and progression of the film is important the way the space is used greatly helps the meaning of the film the way each idea is built off each other and the film smoothly progresses the film to build up to a extremely dramatic ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied,happy
the film itself is brilliant in every way shape and form the film hits you with a bit of reality and then smooths it out into a dream reality we all hold in our head where we find someone and fall in love and its meant to be however the end is where the film throws us back into reality as we are shocked by the plot twist ending where they dont end up together the ending reminds us of what reality is really like not everything can be as perfect as it is made out to be in the movies if everything was as perfect as it was in the movies there would be no one living an ordinary life and so there would be nothing and no one to make a film about follow me on instagram gabewatling if you have any comments or opposing opinions about this i would love to hear them,happy
it was one the of the best movies ive ever seen emma stone and ryan gosling were perfect after watching this youll feel happy and sad at the same time moreover the songs were just amazing i mean i loved the whole soundtrack it usually doesnt happen to me but this time it did ive never loved a movie this much,happy
wow what an incredible surprise this movie was i bought the dvd this afternoon having not seen it at the cinema i had much trepidation about it in view of the many many many poor or terrible reviews its received on imdb but you know what i think people just dont get musicals these days there was a time when musicals were popular because they provided fantasy often a love story of boy meets girl and there was usually a happy ending before i go further let me say i am not usually a fan of musicals myself and that one of the things that i hate most in the world is modern jazz or musical mastion as i often call that i loved whiplash despite its concentration on what i would call modern jazz so although i didnt like the jazz aspect in lll i still thought it a great movie and deserving of many of its oscars one of which was i believe for cinematography the movie is just gorgeous to look at every shot is beautifully composed and lit to perfection the point of the movie should be evident to anyone it is a fantasy a what if something we choose had happened slightly differently what if the first encounter of the two main characters was the only interaction they ever had in a city the size of los angeles what if she hadnt finally landed a part in a big movie what if he had given up on his dream of the jazz club the ending i think was perfect not a saccharin thing but something beautiful i really was incredibly surprised by this one and i look forward to watching it again soon with my wife go into this one with an open mind and you should be rewarded it is a very fine moviejmv,happy
this musical is unbelievably beautiful the lyrics of the songs the instruments and the choreography make the perfect combination the story is always romantic sad at the end and funny in the middle the direction and script are incredible the film is very keen to watch again i give 10 and recommend to all who have not yet watched,happy
where do i start musicals are my guilty pleasure only if theyre any good and this one is filled with jazz and 40s dancing with modern touch it a brilliant feel good movie and a very strong performance from emma stone and ryan gosling this film had a very simple story line but the incredible ending makes up for it all this film has the perfect casting and damien chazelle has done an amazing job directing this film a must watch film for all the family 810performance 910 originality 710 direction 910 story 610 ending 1010,happy
is one for the ages the directing color choices and story line are worth seeing blew me away by the level of creativity and story telling the story centers around two different types of people who find a commonality to inspire hope in each other this movie is magical and though it has moments where it seems to much at the end of the day it never is,happy
honestly  i took this movie as a popcorn movie  just for killing an afternoon with my wife  and the first 34 part of the film exactly matched my expectation  till the fall came  i am not a native english speaker  and in my culture the autumn means mature and harvest  so i took it as a mater of course that the hero and heroine will be together till the end of world with fantastic success in each ones business  then the light turned on and people left with delight  but suddenly it turned out to be a fall  then i realized it would no be a film which i had deemed  the following story was what i did like a bit of mild melancholy but aestheticism  not perfect but realism  its a story in la but i believe every young or was young man or woman would be touched wherever he or she living  i held my wifes hand we are old spouse now  have a happy family and lovely son  but  once we met something seemed unavoidable and unconquerable let us within an inch of breaking fortunately we overcame it that make us could appreciate the movie quietly instead of wiping the tears at the corner alone all i want to say to this film is  thank you thanks for give us a happy and meaningful afternoon ,happy
i saw this film a few weeks ago and im catching up on my reviews this is best picture not moonlight there i said it sue me okay the film is basically about an failed actress named mia played by oscar winner emma stone  oh yeah she earned that award anyway she goes to all these auditions in holllywood and she gets a whole world of no until one day she meets sebastian played by ryan gosling who is a jazz musician and wants to own his own jazz club but hollywood is full of whats in now and doesnt care about whats real so mia and sebastian keep missing each other until one day she hears him playing at a party and they start to date all this stuff happens in between which i cant say because you need to see it its really good i loved it basically the film is dont give up on your dreamsoh yeah the film is a musical please dont dismiss this film because its a musical its really good the songs are catchy and youll be singing those tunes the moment you leave the theater or watch it on bluray some of the songs youll have in your head im sure will be someone in the crowd city of stars star a fire and another day of sunokay lets get this out of the open right now i love and i thought moonlight was crap i wrote a review for that film as well its on my page you can read it if you wish the oscars flub that was heard around the world had it wrong moonlight is not the best picture was and is in my book at least and im sure in many othersshould you watch this film thats up to you you watch it because you want to watch it dont let some critic tell you what to watch im no critic im just saying what i like you might not like it but thats life isnt it if you are having doubts about a movie rent it from redbox and view it first and make your choice its only a few bucks and if you dont like it youre not out of a lot of money or wait for it to be on tv which is silly if you ask me i mean why would you wait 2 or 3 years for cable to play a movie when you can rent it for 2 bucks,happy
great movie overall the story is simple however the complex nature of the two main characters and their will to continue on their journey accompanied by great musical scenes makes this enjoyable to watch if there is one thing this movie teaches us is that we are seeing a birth of a great director damien chazelle at his young age he has already made a couple of great movies and established himself as one of exceptional young talent in hollywoodif you enjoy musicals you will like this i think its damiens unfamiliar take on a typical musical yes its a love story from start to finish but it has its own character and style,happy
this movie will be a legend is amazing it have terrific plot and the soundtrack is superbyou feel that you are in a theater and you can watch a lot of colors and energy in the actors performance im in love with emma stone i hope win a plenty of oscars but the most important it must won best movie,happy
i dont understand what all the fuss is about this film maybe it appeals to a generation that has never seen a decent musical before it has one good song the one that keeps playing on the radio here and thats it emma stone is not a particularly strong singer and ryan gosling is in the same league as rex harrison although they can both dance pretty well every extra on the screen dances better the choreography is mundane and the transitions into song and dance often feel completely forced however if this marks the start of a new golden age of musicals with a new generation of stars who can actually sing and dance then bring it on,happy
yes i know the title of my review and the fact that ive given this film an eight rating seems to be sending contradictory thoughts on how good i thought this film was but i can explain my reasoning and thoughts on this rating processim going to be brutally honest with my opinions on this if im judging this purely on film credentialsqualities ive got some significant issues primarily the pacing it really does lag between sections of the film and this is going to sound bizarre so hear me outbut is the films predictable story structure of young love too comfortable or is that the intention of the film given in essence its a love letter to classic hollywood films of the studio era where audiences pretty much knew what they were going to get going inill leave that one up for debate i supposeon a completely different note i must comment upon ryan goslings singing its not particularly bad its just kind of underwhelming given all that is surrounding itthe most significant question i have to ask in regards to this film however is at what point does nostalgia for films past equal critical acclaim is the film self congratulatory i kind of thought so in certain moments theres a particular piece of dialogue that is so glaringly so i did an unintentional eye roll the reason why i think this is a relevant question is that in recent years weve experienced films that go beyond a nod and a wink to films past and just outright try to recreate and remake extremely popular films of previous years that have been given from my point of view too good critical receptions as simply repackaging these qualities to give to a new modern age audience is not a sign of greatness surely its a sign of lack of creativity the only thing i will say in this films defence to this point is that the films directorwriter damien chazelle i truly do believe has made this film with immense love for the genre of film that has been and earnestly wanted to bring it to the new audience with none of the cynicism i clearly have however where it in my opinion falls down is the predictable and flat storytelling in between the outstanding song and dance numbers that the films soul lives off which is actually a shock as his previous film whiplash is one of my favourite films in the last few years that i constantly tell people to watch as it has brilliant storytelling at the heart of itit really sounds like i didnt enjoy this film doesnt it however lets go on to the positives when its on song it is truly exceptional as an event piece of cinema and certainly worth the price of admission alone three segments in particular are of testament to this the goslingstone bench choreographed number the emma stone final audition song reminded be heavily of anne hatheway in les miserables and the what if reversal of time jazz club finale that was an astonishing spectacle to beholdid be amazed if the score doesnt sweep every awards gong going as it was truly magnificent the songs were generally infectiously fun but what wins you over more then anything for me was the dance numbers and not because they were a nostalgic nod to hollywoods yesteryear but because they were wonderfully entertaining and skilfully put together in their own right with two superb performances from emma stone and ryan gosling at the centre of them putting their heart and soul into something that would have been an enormous challenge in fact the story between the song and dance numbers almost does a disservice to these moments because the dance numbers themselves tell a much better story through that medium emma stone is sublime and she most certainly can sing and her joyfully exuberance performance is the base for the joyful feel of the filmthis is event cinema it has to be seen at the cinema there is no doubt about that as its the sort of film that wont be seen very often on our screens i can certainly see why is has garnered the industries critical acclaim and respect however my own personal take on the film is that not of utter adulation but one of just great respect as a film of flawed brilliance,happy
emma stone is mia and ryan gosling is sebastian in the musical drama namedthe movie introduces you a musical world of colorssongs and dance cheering you with two beautiful characters  mia and serbthey have a story together against the backdrop of great music and brilliant cinematography but when damiendamien chazelledirectorwriter succeeds in introducing us to this world he doesnt let us stay there longmia is waiting to be found as famous actressshe attends auditions and work in a coffee shop for livingserb is a jazz hermithe wants to revive the jazz music culturemia and serb run into each other multiples time and soon they realize that there is something about themthey set off their romantic journey and what happen between them takes us till the end of the moviethe director could have done it a lot better than this it is disappointing to see a movie with all fine ingredients in it but not blended enough to create that magican overly stress in creating this magical musical world has done little justice to the real story of the moviebut i would not hold back appreciate damien chazelle for his attemptjustin hurwitz has done a great job as music director emma stone and ryan gosling are great picks for their charactersthey complemented each other wellif i am asked to pick outstanding category of this movie that would be cinematographyart and dance,happy
undoubtedly the classic of 2016 if you are a big fan of drama like me i would say please die die after watching the movie you have seen enough i bet you will enjoy every moment of 128 minuetseven after two days of watching the movie i am wondering what if the movie was in bw how would i feel watching a movie from 70s am i equally amazed or not or even more i am not sure i dont know would miss emma in yellow maybe yellow is the warmest color however damien chazelle was incredible with his direction and screenplay excellent extraordinary mr chazelle forget about whiplash wont disappoint you at least for the screenplay all the best and what to say about the music soundtracks are good but not up to my expectations you disagree maybe maybe not i dont carefinally i did not find emma and ryan overwhelming throughout the movie especially emma you need to know the thin line between acting and over acting yes i am fully aware of your awards thank youoverall 8 and highly recommended,happy
this is a musical that i thoroughly enjoyed from start to finished its a very vibrant and colorful film that mixes the thematic elements from the old fashioned musicals and themes in the present and the collision of all the enrollments works together really well usually i get bored of musicals because the songs arent all that catchy and gets boring to listen to despite the characters emotions sometimes however in this just about all the songs are catchy and exciting and some of it even heartfelt when the song another day of sun started off as the intro i just had this had this giddy smirk mainly because the song is so darn catchy and old fashioned while having that present suave take to it the main core aspect of the story is about 2 passionate people trying to achieve their dreams while the romance parts is basically the secondary aspect of the story the two actors was great choices for the lead ryan gosling is just really good at bringing about this suave and charismatic jazz pianist he was the replacement for miles teller as good of an actor teller is i think gosling was the right choice i also heard that emma watson was first conspired for this role which might have worked as well but emma stone seem to hit the right notes when it came to the singing scenes overall this is a colorful and marvelous musical that i thoroughly enjoyed however some overly cynical jaded or nihilistic audiences might not enjoy this movie as much but for those that still have hope dreams passion and believe in love and romance will fall for it its the perfect date movie that couples can sit through910,happy
its clear to understand why countless fivestar reviews extravagantly blazon the film poster for as is essentially a film critics dream its a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers and after a career of dissecting and analyzing an innumerable amount of them it must be a certain thrill for a critic to witness one being deconstructed before their very eyesfirst seizes a classic film genre and contorts it re imagining the old hollywood musical by juxtaposing a contemporary los angeles setting with the heightened whimsical reality of those early 20th century productions straddling the two contrasting eras in such an expert manner that they somehow miraculously harmonize the musical sequences are delightfully executed with exhilarating baz luhrmannesque camera swoops capturing charming choreography amongst sumptuous set designs that are doubtlessly littered tarantinolike with suitable film references its near impossible not to be enraptured by this ass infectiously joyful tone combined with its sublime filmmaking aspects produce a positively captivating experience reminding us in a modernized and relevant sense exactly why the musical genre is so beloved and producing a refreshing antidote to the relentless cynicism that permeates our recent culture suitably its narrative is the traditional scenario of a love story between two struggling artists and dreamers with emma stones coffee shop barista mia enduring multiple brutal auditions in the hope of movie stardom while ryan goslings seb is on a oneman mission to change the modern perception of jazz and regain its glory theyre befitting casting with goslings stoic charm and stones buoyant persona hearkening to that specific bygone era while their wry conversational wit simultaneously grounds them in the presentday backdrop also appropriate is the simplistic nature of their developing romance proving the strength of and all its components by producing such impactful scenes from these conventional and exhausted romantic comedy tropes these scenes culminate in a transcendent moment as seb and mia spontaneously float and ballroom dance amongst the stars of an observatory conceiving a surreal sequence that sincerely embodies the beauty and magic of cinemaafter reaching such soaring heights of razzledazzleness it was perhaps inevitable that would ultimately fizzle out and in an act of rather unexpected cruelty the enchanting development the film has so effectively accomplished is dismantled before the viewers eyes the somewhat jarring introduction of sebs old friend keith john legend is the catalyst that spurs this sudden shift of tone as seb accepts his soulless job offer despite a lasting desire to own a jazz bar thereafter seb and mias aspirations for themselves and one another are continually dashed and dampened their passions gradually engulfing their passions for each other while the film adopts an unforeseen gloomy essence of realismits where motifs from director damien chazelles last feature whiplash 2014 a savage observation of artistic ambition are introduced as chazelle essentially hijacks this established genre with his personal beliefs and developing directorial trademarks in retrospect the foreshadowing is evident an earlier scene of seb and mia strolling through the warner brothers studio back lot allows the viewer a peak behind the cinematic curtain before eventually takes them behind its own nevertheless without the sheen of old hollywood charm the simplistic nature of the plot is ultimately exposed as the unoriginal clichridden fameesque narrative it actually is with its discussions on hopes and dreams now obtaining a level of triteness additionally the approach is neither authentic nor hardhitting enough to be entirely effective instead striking an unsatisfying middle ground that fails to fulfill the potential of its inspired and intriguing concept gratefully the film somewhat salvages itself by its culmination reintroducing its much missed homages with a beautifully performed sequence that in its own unusual bittersweet way depicts the power film is capable of and is an ode to cinema itselfindeed is a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers but its exact assessment of the subject is something for the viewer to ponder while theres undoubtedly an ingenious aspect of deconstructing a departed genre for a modern age theres simultaneously an element of cynicism and cinematic sacrilege in a pessimistic society and a film and television landscape that frequently reflect that and its in this respect would ironically be more subversive if it retained its jubilant spirit is it truly necessary or beneficial for the audience to glimpse beyond this cinematic curtain for a few hours can ignorance be bliss and can the sanctity of film be sacred while the audience resides temporarily at least in the whimsical escapism of,happy
the film starts in a common musical introduction proceeds with the leads then onto the clich of an actress and a musician trying to reach their dreams sound boring at first but clearly this is a breath of fresh air for 2016 the script wasnt amazing bland in comparison with ie casablanca of course but the aspirations of both leads pulls through the chemistry is there if you have watched their previous movies so its quite biased what i liked and mostly what saved the entire film in my honest opinion was the ending it was a consensus of both parties to part in a bittersweet tone the longing of what could have been was there but it is what it is reality hits them hard it takes the audience into a romantic fantasy only to brings us back to reality a familiarity we can all relate to stone was great gosling was lacking great film for 2016 but bland in comparison with classic musical movies,happy
with director damien chazelle proves with this and his 2014 effort whiplash hes a talented and ingenious film maker at a young age and female lead emma stone dazzles us with her shining glistening aura throughout although unnuanced writing and a poorly paced middle section weigh down the film from masterpiece to only a truly great moviecontains moments and scenes where you just cant help but marvel at the absolute luxury that film goers have in watching films of this caliber utilising widescreen cinemascope tsk tsk the stunning cinematography and effectiveness of shots can render many an observer to an incapacitated mess on a floor drenched in drool there is not one whiff of overexaggeration in that statement the cinematography is a clear bonus to this filmin addition the musical numbers are excellent and wholly nostalgic and whimsical although singing from the two leads does leave some more training to be desired the thrilling another day of sun number at the start features a singingdancing show for our pleasure and this one setpiece will go down as one of the great moments in recent musical history but the best and possibly most prominent song in the film is the quiet and introspective city of stars which features the lead ryan gosling as its performer the song simply oozes classic hollywood and is a great addition to the fantastic sound heard throughout the filmperformances are satisfactory at worst particularly from malelead gosling and truthfully it is the starpower of emma stone that carries this film as mia she carries a bubbly sunshining effervescence that allows viewers to fall completely in love with this character with her eyes alone we can learn much about who she is as a character more so than many other aspects of this film she keeps us interested and we want to see her arc come to a solid and happy conclusion gosling although willing to show restraint in his acting much like his costar cannot elevate himself to the level of stone though that isnt a criticism on his part since he was great as a struggling jazz pianist sebastian he just wasnt able to compete with emmas oscarworthy performancein terms of direction chazelle proves hes only gotten better since directing his 2014 jazz masterpiece whiplash however his writing leaves more to be desired the two leads manage to make use of chazelles lazy writing and turn their characters into fully realized and 3 dimensional people luckily for chazelle furthermore the middle section as some others have pointed out feels rushed and not comparable to the start and end of the film i myself completely agree although we get to see the chemistry between the two leads on full display we dont see anything matching the vibrant musical introduction to los angeles or the simultaneously triumphantsad although magnificent conclusion to mia and sebastians storyall in all i wouldnt be surprised if this film earns that best picture oscar and i wouldnt mind one bit it is a fantastic film featuring great direction an astonishing female lead performance from emma stone wonderful cinematography amazing music and musical numbers and is an original take on a long historic genre of film,happy
wasnt quit sure what to make of it when i saw the trailer but i have say its a film that actually pleasantly surprised me basically its nice feel good film which had the feel of a hollywood musical from the 1950s didnt have the same impact but i guess they were trying to give it modern day look which didnt quite work but for me is still a decent film that has your foot tapping at times during the musical numbers started off well with a grand opening but i felt a bit flat in the middle but ended on a high although the ending felt a bit bittersweetnormally not that keen on ryan gosling but he actually surprised me in this film he does have some acting talent after all emma stone as usual just seems to light up the screen with her presence and played off well against goslingif you wanting a film that offers you an alternative to bloods guts guns and swearing this is for you will have you singing to yourself as you leave the cinemai am a sucker for a musical ,happy
i was seriously in suspicion about it im not very much into musicals apart from the sound of music and singing in the rain but both emma and ryan stole the picture the movie isnt about dancing or singing well it is about the land of dreams wich could be la or your neighborhood it just puts more pressure into them since it is la to me this movie is about two young people still very attached to their childhood dream and struggling to keep it afloat while everyone asks them to growup whats beautiful to me  heart clinging beautiful  is that they believe in each other so much they help the other get there but it is a lonely road out there its tribute to jazz and is also touching so both characters have really solid dreams and both are being dragged away from them for failure and background noise pressurethough none of them can sing or dance so well i dont think that was the point it wasnt supposed to be flawless  i believe this movie wants to keep it real you may feel like youre walking on clouds but youre not such a good dancer and theres some tenderness in being kind of clumsy i believe it is intentional the love between mia and sebastian is easy to believe it is respectful and tender and inspiring either romantically or not everyone should have a mia or a sebastian in his life to help us and motivate us when doors slam on our face i absolutely loved the ending which in my opinion consolidates it as a modern day love story,happy
if youre into musical films this movie is the right one for you if you dont like these films or deprecate their characteristics chant dance  including tap dance romance imagery but expect action or breath holding suspense you should avoid the movie is a homage to those movies and archetypal in his narrative style spoiler but its more than just a tribute movie the story takes place here and now its message missing readiness to compromise ego centrism reflects our modern society so the movie is an update of the genre with vintage structure and a contemporary point of view ps im not a native englisch speaker so please excuse mistakes,happy
i liked this film very much  the time flew by and i was completely transported to a place of dreams and high emotion it felt fresh nave without being sickening romantic without being cloying and had a a very nice touch of casablanca about it as someone who grew up surrounded by art and artists i am very familiar with both the romanticism and impossibility of a lasting relationship between two artists and that sentiment rang very truethe film is of a very particular type of pleasure though  the exquisite kind that leaves one ultimately unsatisfied perhaps it is as it should be  or perhaps it could have been truly magnificent if it had a little more understatement and a little more flair where it counts i have great respect emma stone and she was terrific  and yet in my opinion this film could have been made brilliant with a lead whod be more elegant stylish and lush someone like jenna dewan or scarlet johanssonall in all a perfectly dreamy romantic emotional and bittersweet musical and miles better than most hollywood films in the past 20 years nearly worth all the hype,happy
damien chazelle has a gift to get melancholic and struggle the stomach of feelingsthe movie i hooked from start to finish what struck me was the fact of having a palette of colors that knew how to manipulate to make it according to the dialog that was expressing the character the truth was quite surprised how the story unfolds and the management of cropping welldefined plans and the beautiful photography of the cityand good with regard to the dialog i found it a little tedious i have to admit that i did not have the same level as it was in his film whiplash,happy
clever heartwarming original and classic all at the same time excellent acting and unique story that is inspiring and reminds us of choices we make affect our life dramatically people who love musicals will appreciate this movie and its clever remake of the genre it took guts to make this throwback movie as it is about careers and relationships with no technology ryan gosling is excellent at acting dancing and singing and piano playing emma stone is perfect in her role too she is a modern maria with dreams and insecurities and naivety about the business and he is jaded and realistic about their industry and each influences the other and they each find success as a result but at the expense of their relationship,happy
i dont recommend bringing a date to this movie because of  the story is decent the last ten minutes made me cringe hoping they do not screw up the ending it is not difficult to guess what the ending is going to be but the journey to the conclusion is what makes this interesting the singing and dancing was not really that good ok for the shower at home but not for hollywood they are good actors but you need different skill sets for the other two he was stronger than her when they dance in an ensemble the lack of grace and smoothness shows this is about young lovers dreaming big and hitting the reality barrier and making adult choices not date movie,happy
is sad i dont know what i was expecting from a film that gathered so much attention probably i was expecting a lot of music and everyone singing i was expecting a nice love story and a happy end and if it was all i got it would be a musical version of notebook but things got just a little more complicated if you want to achieve something you need to sacrifice a lot i think the main idea behind this film is expressed when they meet after his first concert i understand perfectly why she reacted the way she did for his first performance in a band and i understand perfectly why he enjoyed what he was not that much into it was a first success in a path of grim failures she started to see him as bit of a different person who betrayed a bit of himself and she felt sort of cheated but was that the problem really from my point of view he always loved her and probably waited for her right until the end but did she  to sum up dont go to this film with a date it will leave a bitter feeling the film is about sacrifices in a creative career and about the love of one man,happy
ive been a musical movie fan since 12 i remember the first time when i saw a musical movie i was amazed by how characters suddenly started singing and dancing while one second ago they were just talking like normal people i didnt know such a wonderful world exist it was just like a dream world for a 12 year old for two or three years since then i would look for old musical movie discs and would play those i love over and over again as if i stopped watching those wonderful musical movies the dreamy musical world would disappear from me then for years i havent have much new findings of good musical movies and as a grown up i almost forgot my teenage passion for musical movies but this movie brought it all back this movie has made it to return to the musical movies original nature yet it is not without modern observations and values it is classical and new at the same time what is more magical about this movie is that after going out of the movie theater when you sit in your own couch at home listening to the original sound track those happy and sad emotions in the theater all come back to you i am sure in 10 or 20 years on a random day if i turn on the radio and if it plays a song from this movie i will cry againthank you director thank you the whole movie crew,happy
710 an actress and a jazz pianist fall in love in this musical love story directed by damien chazelle who also did whiplash in 2014 a movie i really loved this time he pairs up ryan gosling and emma stone and theyre beautiful together they show what two class actors can do when put together i enjoyed their chemistry and the heart they put into this the music and the score are fantastic and put you in the film with them one draw back i found however is that either of them can sing well and they both have quite weak and quiet voices i would have enjoyed some stronger lead voices also not to give anything away but i liked the whole ride i just didnt like the way the director decided to go with the ending it left me a bit angry all those troubles aside if you are a fan of musicals ryan gosling and or emma stone then you must see this one if not then i think you will actually hate it,happy
i went to see with my girlfriend last night in a packedout screen mostly filled with young couples i was actually looking forward to this film although admittedly with some trepidation as i dont really tend to trust the general movie going publics opinion on what is good or notlet me first of all say this is a fantastic film its a wonderful modern take on the classic hollywood musicals of the past the acting cinematography choreography and wardrobe are all on point and likely to be some of the best you will see this year and beyond the songs are not particularly memorable howeverin brief emma stone plays mia an aspiring actress currently working as a barista on the warner bros lot and ryan gosling plays sebastian a jazz aficionado who drives 5 miles out of the way for a coffee just to be near a jazz club they each have their dreams and aspirations for the future but are currently unhappy with their lot in life after falling for each other she helps him believe in staying true to his dreams whilst he helps reinforce her passion for acting but the road is never as easy in real life as it is in the schmaltzy musicals of yesteryear and the dreams they carefully work to maintain threaten to tear them apartthis in particular is what the movie does superbly while the plot could be considered as formulaic you will see things coming before they happen on screen in classic musicals like singin in the rain 1952 and mary poppins 1964 there is always a happy ending subverts this but not in the way you would expect and i personally thought this was a very clever and sweet way to end the filmthe performances are uniformly brilliant gosling does an excellent job but emma stone in particular wow she really blew me away in this film and i would not be in the least bit surprised if she picks up the best actress gong at the academy awards as it would be fully deserved in the beginning she goes to an audition which we see her practicing for in her car at the start of the film and is roundly ignored her soliloquy and performance in this audition and is one of the most powerful and realistic pieces of acting i have seen in many years more clever in the fact that she is acting while acting very meta this movie isnt for everyone and i would imagine that some will detest it as it is quite slow moving the songs arent catchy and theres not really a lot of them and as previously mentioned the plot is formulaic there was also quite a few confused looking faces in the audience at my screening in the end which genuinely made me laugh my ass off as they didnt get it they were pretty young so its forgivable but i personally found it endearing a joy to watch and im looking forward to seeing it again,happy
in the interest of not exposing the spoilers this review will only focus on the existentialism of what it means to be a musical hollywood loves hollywood and i never want you to talk to me again i mean it dudeis not a whiplash but we do get to see jk simmons pushing his oscar this is a musical albeit a minor one because neither of the leads can really sing or dance then again acting emma stone is so cute and adorable she makes you want to shrink her up and swallow her up in a gelcap ryan gosling peace be with you consistently struggles to appear absent of his psychopathic tendenciesa musical should be    musical i love jazz and this movie is about hating jazz if you want to learn jazz explore jazz appreciate jazz try round midnight instead dexter gordon will see you throughmy mom once said never ever talk to me againi wonder whether that should have had three exclamation pointsi hope that never ever pretends again to be what it is not a great movie its a fine film nothing more and nothing less if you find solace in this melange and pastiche i have a dictionary just waiting for you,happy
from the incandescent reviews that preceded this picture i was expecting something like a cross between singing in the rain and moulin rouge by the end of the opening sequence on the motorway overpass it was obvious we were going to get neither it was all shot outdoors with naturalistic lighting despite this being la one of the sunniest places in the world the light was poor shadows fell over faces and in the night time scenes people almost disappeared even the two leads if they hadnt been wearing that yellow dress and a white shirt they would have disappeared altogether strangely on the promo still both characters are illuminated in a gene kelly like glow worthy of cinemascope this was disappointing to say the least then as the fantasy sequences began i expected there to be a switch to full lighting or a change of film stock to zap us into the eponymous of the title but no these were dull and poorly lit as well wasted opportunities how my wife and i yearned for kelly or baz luhrman to jazz this up a bit pun intended what we got was a pretty prosaic story with no real antagonist to thwart the couple there was no evil boss horrible parents wicked sister invading army or other mcguffin to keep them apart in the third act all we got was a rather contrived row which could have been sorted out with one phone call thousands of couples survive being on the road or becoming a film star why was it so difficult for these two i thought of johnny cash and june carter who really did love each other forever despite decades of troubles then a whole sliding doors alternate universe happens and our heroes lives go off on an inexplicable tangent did neither of them pick up the phone in five years boy could these guys hold a grudge after one aborted dinner so despite being an alleged homage to hollywood musicals we dont get a happy ending i get it to suffer for ones art pain is necessary especially in jazz or in method acting but you sort of promised us one at least in the promotional material the acting itself however was first rate both ryan gosling and emma stone were as good as ever and did their best with the often underwritten material for them alone the film still gets an eight,happy
i almost dont want to say a word about this in fear of saying too much but is the best cinematic experience you will have it is everything you will ever look for in a movie and this comes from a guy whos not a huge fan of musicals manages to tell story that is dreamy yet mature but the true beauty is it doesnt need gory violence crude language or nudity to express a beautiful story about human nature damien chazelle has proved that people dont movies to be nasty or dark to be beautiful and meaningful this movie is a success and is an instant classic you cannot be disappointed it will reach every expectation you have for an amazing movie,happy
not a movie for everyone that is for sure however having already seen whisplash i had a very good feeling about that movie not to mention that the entire cast was already promising but the direction is what i was mostly looking for and as it turned out this is yet another masterpiece at least for the distinguished crowd and the ppl who are looking for something light but meaningful romantic but real to the core actually the first scene is more than enough and is a great opening that is as impressive as the many other visual scenes that would follow and between all the music the swift and sophisticated moves the tap dancing the colors the smiles and the stages you end up noticing the moments of silence the moments of truththis tiny instant between two records or notes when everything seems to be some kind of a distant vision a trip to a future that could have been but that wont necessarily happenone vision out of many others one possibility out of a multitude never going with one perspective but covering all of themhers hisand theirs together definitely a must see for the experience of seeing something unique for once cheesy at times but a different kind of cheesy nonetheless albeit the good and refined kind,happy
movie is already in my top 10 favorite movies list of 2017 my personal rating 8710 im very hard to give rating more than 75oh boy the chemistry between ryan gosling and emma stone is the best i have seen in a very very long time theyre extremely sweet and cute together dont forget the comedy i love it very much plus the music no dont get me there i had cried in the cinema and im not going to do this again unless if im watching it for the second third fourth and so on timeit is the best romance on screen yet and the ending watch it yourselves very subtle and realistic and if you precisely get it congratulations youre a matured manwoman this movie has a bohemian taste of film art and the director surely carried full research to direct the movie as it has astounding performance,happy
is a romantic musical filled with a nostalgic salute to hollywoods golden agethe plot is quite simple two young people trying to achieve their dreams in the land of dreams they are filled with passion and find love in each otherdo not expect a so called girly movie tho we follow their arising problems as well as their love these problems are usually connected with abandoning their big dreams to get a decent life or as many say it growing uplife happens to drive their ways to different directions which leads to fulfill their dreams but also to lose each othera couple of times i felt like i was watching casablanca like in the masterpiece of michael curtiz the two in love have a melody which wakes the feeling of their dreaming days in them their love the lines we will always have paris came to my mind as watching the final minutes and as they said goodbye to each other with their eyesthey will always have,happy
its not the kind of musical movies that you used which are full of dancing and good music of course you are going to experience one of the best musical movies ever but thats not the main movie its highly dramatic with highly realistic message heres to the fools who dreamdamien chazelle had just nailed it in this movie after he nailed it in whiplash which is one of my top favorite movies but actually i loved whiplash more of course the cinematic view of is much much better but whiplash was a really special case for me and i couldnt have that in he definitely deserves an academy award nomination at least this yearryan gosling  emma stone were so so blended and i really loved them emma stone was dramatically better than gosling and did much better but overall they were both great if they will get any nomination i think only emma stone deserves iti hoped jk simmons had a bigger role but he was just a guest that we lovea definitely great experience and i highly recommend watching my rating is 910,happy
opening scene stalled traffic a los angeles freeway at the dreaded standstill every car blasting a different aural vibe what next road rage coughing fits valiumpopping instead you get the voice of one driver smooth as honey singing loud and clear she climbs out of her car and starts to dance soon everyone is out of their carssinging dancing skateboarding on the jersey barrier in other words once traffic starts again youre in for a different kind of movie ride thats a joyful suspension of disbelief moment there true to the conventions of the movie musical west side story is the only movie ive ever seen multiple times in the theater each time wishing hoping praying that when chino appears at the end with his gun hed bring along some different outcome i recall a youthful knucklehead dismissing the film as unrealistic yeah right you either go with it you dont in the case of lala land i did and hope you will writerdirector damien chazelle has put together a film in which each musical number grows organically from the action onscreen the music is more than just pleasant with some memorable tunes ryan gosling and emma stone are excellent in the leads roles and effective songsters for the style of their numbers the dancing seems mostly theirs too and they really sell it two strivers want to make it in tinseltownhe as a jazz pianist she as an actress will they reach their dreams will their relationship survive the journey it may be a ride youve taken before but its a smooth one and according to varietys owen gleiberman its a filmmaking trifectait hooks the heart the eye and the mind that he says is even better when viewed the second time around,happy
im kind of a sucker for a good musical but regardless of any preconceived preferences to any specific type of genera this movie was an instant classic in my book gosling and stone put forth some of their best performances to date and just when i thought i couldnt like them anymore they dazzled me with much more than just good acting they took me back to what a good movie is and should be a movie with a great story line meaningful music and overall a brilliant 128 minutes its the kind of movie that you cant just leave the theater and forget about it compels a discussion afterwards thank you chazelle for surprising me just when i thought i couldnt be surprised any longer,happy
this is only the third hollywood musical i have seen after high school musical and les miserables while the former was crap the latter was a masterpiece but the commonality between the two movies was that they were coherent within themselves thats what was missing in for the first half at least its a good movie overall with beyond brilliant second half but only if you are able to survive the first half story 710 two people keep bumping into each other on various occasions and eventually fall for each other only to realize that their professional success will come at the cost of their love life incidentally none of them are dishonest but the circumstances bring them at a juncture where they have to pick one the story is written on a very strong plot but as it gets into the details it starts falling apart la was a nearperfect location to base this story with ryan gosling portraying a struggling musician a jazz enthusiast and emma stone projecting an aspiring actress with a day job at a coffee shop the build up of their love affair is totally unconvincing as far as the first half goes the scenes do not have much connect between them and the music pieces are abrupt just because you have a musical doesnt mean you need to have a song every 2 minutes this movie would have been much better without the musical piece however it is the second half where the movie gets far better the scenes are well thought and the music pieces  especially city of stars and the fools who dream  are very profound and apt to the situation acting 810 ryan gosling might have squeezed every little drop of his charm into this movie but he came across as a far stronger actor than his counterpart emma stone while the roles werent so challenging the two have been good enough individually however for me the chemistry was somewhat missing between the two actors i could totally see jennifer lawrence in mias role instead apart from these two none of the other actors have received much screen time to create any impact music 810 the film rides on quite a strong music and lyrics it looks a little unnecessary and too much in the first half except for another day of sun which was quite perfect to set the tone of the movie as well as get the audience into an la mood however some of the songs like city of stars epilogue and the fools who dream are so good that you can listen to them on repeat mode direction 710 damien chazelle probably took a little too much into his plate with story writing direction as well as lyrics while i love the way he steered the movie in the second half it is the first half where the movie is all over the place and very confusing the build up of the story is pretty vague the scenes are very much incoherent and an unconvincing however the later part of the movie is good i loved the choice of climax especially the last scene with a rewind sequence which was very unconventional full marks to the director for thatoverall 710 overall its a watchable movie if you can sit through the first half,happy
after the ebullient opening scene of a musical number staged in an la traffic jam and featuring a cast that celebrates the diversity of that city i thought i was going to adore but nothing else in the movie quite measures up to that opening scenei liked the film some of it quite a lot but it did not affect me the way it has so clearly affected others im a bit surprised that people are talking about leaving the movie on a high or referring to its ending as happy doesnt exactly end unhappily but the happiness it does deliver to our principal characters is qualified the film both an homage to and a contemporary recalibration of the mgm musicals of hollywoods golden age suggests that human lives have more than one possible happy ending and that by choosing one you necessarily have to pass over another better be sure then that the one you choose is the one that will leave you with the fewest regrets about the ones you let pass byryan gosling and emma stone have enough chemistry to light a fire indeed they have so much that one is almost disappointed that they arent a reallife couple i dont know that the characters they play in this film take either actor that far out of hisher comfort zone but both give terrifically charismatic performances stone especially steals the film right out from under the feet of everyone else gosling and kinetic director damien chazelle of whiplash fame includedive seen others refer to as a love letter to los angeles i dont know la that well and what ive seen of it i didnt care for so i might be biased but this film struck me as less a valentine to the city of angels and more of an examination of the allure the world of fame exercises over dreamers and the determination that world demands of those who are going to make it theregrade a,happy
five stars out of fivethe critically acclaimed romantic comedydrama musical from writerdirector damien chazelle who also performed both duties on 2014s whiplash my favorite movie of that year the film tells the story a jazz pianist that falls in love with a struggling actress while they both try to get by in los angeles the movie stars ryan gosling and emma stone in their third film together playing lovers after crazy stupid love and gangster squad and it costars john legend rosemarie dewitt and jk simmons in a cameo appearancehe won an oscar for hisperformance in whiplash on top of being almost unanimously praised by critics it was also named one of the ten best movies of the year by the american film institute and its expected to likely win best picture at next years academy awards i really enjoyed itmia stone and sebastian gosling are both strugglingartists trying to make a living while doing what they really love in los angeles sebastian is a jazz musician who attempts to pay the bills by playing bars and parties while mia is an aspiring actress who gets by serving coffee to actors on the set of a movie studio the two meet and dont immediately take a liking to each other but eventually mutual attraction appears to grow between them they then take turns supporting each other in their different passions while attempting to maintain a relationshipchazelle is a drummer who wrote back in 2010 when he was still just an aspiring filmmaker all three of his movies including 2009sguy and madeline on a park bench which is also a musical focus heavily on jazz music i think this is a very passionate subject for him as is film and its because of this strong heartfelt passion that his films become such great masterpieces this is an old fashioned soon to beclassic musical i saw it with my parents and they loved it because this genre of film is so rare i think it will win best picture its definitelyone of my favorites of the year gosling and stone are both fantastic in it and theyhave beautiful chemistry together once again the romance between their characters is both very touching and believable as well its a great film watch our movie review show movie talk at httpsyoutubeufnwelgyj4 ,happy
great experience even for a nonmusical lover ive dont remember a time walking out of a theater and being so convinced that a movie was going to rack up some oscars some parts were certainly cheesy and predictable but thats half of what makes musicals fun im torn about the ending on one hand i love they kept it simple with the soft smile and eye contact but on the other hand the hopeless romantic in me would love to have seen them work things out also being in the middle of trying to figure out what i want to do with my life the ending really hit home for me to me it exemplified all the what could have been scenarios hats off to chazelle and gosling though phenomenal first attempt at a musical by chazelle and im developing quite the mancrush on gosling this year between this and the nice guys incredible how quickly he learned the piano and how to dancealso i imagine the cinematography wont get much attention but it was fantastic great job of paralleling mia and sebastians relationship shots together in middle of the movie and single shots during fights,happy
i cant find how to describe this wonderful picture i think the right term or adjective has still not yet found one of the most elegant delicious captivating movies of all time is waiting for you to be seenwhen i first heard that a new picture of chazelle coming i was expecting something great because he put the slat very top with whiplash but this was far above my expectations color dancing scenes penetrative acting by emma stone and ryan gosling not even necessary to mention about its entrancing soundtrack i have been listening its album for 2 days and all the movie comes in front of my eyes again and maybe the most important of all for me is that it includes jazz chazelle used a bit of everything an amazing balance of dramacomedy and music without overdoing anything so that you just find yourself somewhere between happiness and sadness but if there is anything definite you feel it very intense when you left the cinema and damien chazelle of course he had already won my admiration with whiplash which is the best movie for me in 2014 but after which is the best picture of the year for me again my admiration has even more increased for him if he doesnt break his line he might be one of the greatest directors of all time in the future in short dont miss it,happy
dont get me wrong i enjoyed this that being said i didnt think it was quite the level of omg this was awesome raves that its been getting i cant help but think that half the reason this is getting such critical acclaim is because its set in hollywood and is about hollywood if these characters had been some something other than a struggling actress and musician and it was set in another city it wouldnt be doing as well if the critics and ampas people didnt identify with it as much as they do would they still love it,happy
and  oscar goes to   this promise to be said at the oscar ceremony to be held at the end of february yes it is true i have traveled to the future and i have learned the end result such movies are not doing it anymore it was a very accurate word its like an oldtime movie but it was built with a modern infrastructure it was a fairytale film that was reinforced by the facts and technology of the era we lived on those who do not like the musical may not like the musical but they will watch it i know myself i do not like singin in the rain that everyone fancies i like to listen to the music but the dances are boring to me but is that so the dance scenes that resemble indian movies are not much in the way i have already mentioned i think i might have loved him that much already the musical is called this film but the romantic part of it is heavier its a musical somewhat romanticdrama style it has a pure delicate beauty it is a star of the year 2016 that you feel as if you were different from your first stage i loved the soundtrack of stars with city of stars i can say that oscar is unrivaled in original music the city of stars plays the song so many times that you get bored if you hear so many other songs so often but you can say that you play a little more as you listen to it damien chazelle emma stone and ryan gosling what kind of work did you do i always call it an oscar but i need to say that each of these three will get at least a nomination emma stone is fascinated by its beauty beauty ryan is a romantic man we remember from the notebook movie with rachel mcadams it is a player who can be played without thinking in such roles chazelle made the right choice both players what im going to tell you about chazelle is that hes a musician i do not know if he might worship music whiplash first now this movie dude please keep making movies in the film there is a message like capitalism and human being as a subtext or i do not know if it came to me messages such as returning from ideals for money being a slave of money abandoning its goals because the community does not like it living for others waiting for others to like you constantly i think thats the main idea i think these kinds of things add more to the reality of people i did not know the essence is not the year but maybe the best musical of all time this years best film did i say that good looking ,happy
went to see it the first time about two weeks ago and like others on this thread was put off a little by all the bells and whistles but after watching it and having play out in my head i realized i had missed something so i went to see it againin the fantasy scene that plays out after mia enters the jazz club sebastian starts it by playing their theme song but the fantasy is played out through mias eyes but by playing their song he was admitting to the mistakes he had made in their relationship and she was imagining what their life together wouldve been had he not made those mistakes of course this was all fantasy and neither of them wouldve realized their respective dreams had their relationship worked out but they also wouldnt have realized their dreams had they not been togetherthat is what i missed the first time that i got on the second viewingtwo other things i found interesting were the opening song and dance sequence where everyone is stuck in a traffic jam but singing how everything is great because it is another day of sun and the fact they had to tell you what season it was,happy
i have now seen the film that will win the oscar for best picture of 2016 did i mention it was a musicaldirected by damien chazelle whiplash is a love letter to los angeles hollywood and the movie musicals of the 40s and early 50s sprinkled in with a healthy dose of 2016 reality the images are lush and fantastical the music is emminently hummable the dance numbers are sharp and to the point and the performances of the two leads are charming and engagingstarring emma stone as mia an aspiring actress she meets jazz pianist sebastian ryan gosling  love fantasy songs and dance ensuethere are times when you see a film and you think no one but this person could play this role recent examples of this are jk simmons in whiplash cate blanchett in blue jasmine and javier bardem in no country for old men such is the case with emma stones portrayal as mia her aspiring actress is charming eager enthusiastic jaded naive and worldly  often at the same time her dancing is sharp and spoton while her singing is very goodfairing less well in the singing category is gosling while his singing is better than other actorsingers like pierce brosnan in mama mia or russell crowe in les miserables i would rate goslings singing as passably agreeable fortunately his character is a pianist so he spends more time on the keyboards and less time singing but when he gets up from behind the piano and interacts  and dances  with stone the magic happens there is great chemistry between the two leads and that chemistry and charm radiates the screen and pours out into the audiencespecial notice needs to be made of the choreography from mandy moore dancing with the stars  it is spectacular and perfect for the mood and feeling of this film at times when one sees a musical the dancing stops the story in the choreography enhanced and furthered the story and i cant wait to see this film again just to see the musical numbers and the choreographydirector chazelle shares with us a vision the cinematography and images portrayed are intriguing and beautiful and the story and acting moves along crisply for the most part the film was also written by chazelle and it is clear that he had a clear idea in his head that he did not waver to put on filmis it a perfect film no the film drags abit at about the 23 mark and the ending isnt exactly what i was expecting but was appropos for what director chazelle set us up for i see multiple academy award nominations for this film and wouldnt be surprised to see multiple trophies carried home  costume design cinematography score song director and especially actress stone and film9 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the bank ofmarquis,happy

may not be everyones cup of tea but lets look at why there are so many reasons to see this inspired film to name a few important ones go see it if you believe in the power of music dance romance and dreams this film beguiled me and i can see how it beguiles its viewers through its lighthearted approach to a serious topic how do we chase and hold on to our dreams without losing them hats off to damien chazelle for reviving the musical genre in an engaging and thoroughly entertaining way the acting writing and direction are spot on the movie takes some time to build momentum in the story line but when it does it really takes you on a journey emma stone is perfectly cast as the vulnerable and quirky young actress while ryan goslings character is a complex layer of jazz tradition dreams stubbornness clarity and magic all spun together i loved that the director saluted the hey day and romance of the hollywood musical and that perhaps its not a genre that is dead but very much alive if youre willing to let the film take you on a journey and suspend your expectations the magic of this film will find its way into your heart and mind i also say hats off to the ending which was both inspired and realistic and not a typical hollywood ending but still retains a lingering touch of magic like the final note of a piano piece that still resonates in the air after it ends two thumbs up,happy
rarely does it happen you sit back in your seat expecting to watch a good film but the film engrosses you taking you to the depth of an ocean where you are charmed by magical scenes in which love has been depicted is a film i have longed to see for years the theme the plot and acting are all good enough to make it a masterpiece it is a wonderful musical and the songs are certain to last for ages love is framed realistically avoiding simple fantasies as handicaps threaten love the viewers become a captive audience i loved the film so much i want to watch it again with my friends and i will advise many not to miss this great film,happy
damien chazelle did it again his whiplash knocked it out of the park two years ago and is everything we can ask for and more the fabulous score and the skillful direction make this piece a thoroughly engrossing experience the chemistry between ryan gosling and emma stone works like a charm chazelle shows us how to craft a movie that is as welltuned as a seasoned jazz pianists instrument we can enjoy the harmonious relationship between the cadence of the plot and that of the melodies weaved into the fabric of the storyis much more than a musical it speaks to anyone who lets themselves be awed by highquality professional art the entire movie feels just right in its pacing its style and surprisingly perhaps its message it is uplifting when a film manages to encourage us to chase our dreams without being naively ignorant of life outside the movie theater we are told a hollywood story that rises above itself it brings value into a frivolous genre with ease joy and all the right moves,happy
2016 release 128 min brings the story of mia and sebastian as the movie opens there is gridlock on the freeway and for no apparent reason we get the first songanddance by the ensemble cast brought in a single take lasting several minutes and ending with sebastian and mia having a miniroad rage moment its not long before we see mia a barista dreaming of becoming an actress failing one audition after another meanwhile seb is an ol school jazz pianist when he refuses to stick to the christmas music set list at the club where he works and instead goes on a dazzling improvisation he is promptly fired mia happens to be walking by hears the piano improvisation and goes inside the club at this point were 15 min into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays outcouple of comments this is the latest film from writerdirector damien chazelle who last year came out of nowhere with is impressive debut film whiplash for his sophomore release chazelle sticks to the music world but this time in an allaround ol fashioned hollywood musical when the movies opening titles announce presented in cinemascope you know this is going to be just like the good ol days and that certainly turns out to be the case the musical numbers are simply outstanding and just as important move the films story line forward the movie benefits enormously from the obvious chemistry between the two leads emma stone and ryan gosling while the movies overall story arc is quite familiar you simply enjoy the scenes for what they bring john legend brings an important secondary performance as keith the leader of a jazzrb band called the messengers at one point seb and keith debate how authentic the jazz sound of the messengers should be keith observes youre holding on to the past but jazz is all about the future speaking of the musical score if you are not into music by all means do yourself a favor and find another movie to see because in the end the music is the heart and soul of the film as was the case for whiplash the music is courtesy of relative newcomer justin hurwitz harvard classmate of chazelle i read the other day heavy on jazz but with plenty of pure orchestral moments as well the core is nothing short of brilliantis one of the years most anticipated releases for me as i absolutely loved whiplash due to various yearend scheduling conflicts and commitments i just now had a chance to see it the matine screening where i saw this at was attended very nicely much to my surprise i noticed a number of young 678 yr old kids in the audience i wouldve loved to ask them afterwards what they thought of this movie i loved the movie period and will end up high on my yearend list of best movies of 2016 is highly recommended,happy
just saw and i think this is probably my favorite movie of 2016the film directed by damien chazelle who also directed 2014s whiplash follows the story of two artists a musician named sebastian played by ryan gosling and an actress named mia played by emma stone who fall for each other and have to figure out not only what they want to do with their careers but also with their lives after the movie was completed i was in awe of what i have just saw the film was a beautiful tribute to old hollywood and the films produced then it also manages to present some interesting social commentary about the state of the film industry as well as the reality of someone working in that industry the cast was great gosling and stone had great chemistry they truly felt like a real couple and both performances felt genuine and real the musical numbers were also amazing im definitely looking up the soundtrack on spotify the cinematography by linus sandgren was also amazing his work felt colorful and vibrant chazelles direction as well as writing was great and never manage to hold back overall thoughts from the script to the acting to the cinematography and musical numbers to the direction is a complete tribute to old hollywood and manages to both honor the legacy of that era while also managing to tell a heartfelt story about two artists falling in love in the city of dreams this is a fantastic movie and quite possibly my favorite movie of 2016 i highly recommend seeing this movie during the holiday season its worth your time and money as they say in showbiz sometimes they dont make them like they used to,happy
they dont make em like this anymore is the thing most people will say when they leave the theater as the credits roll on and theyre right is a 1950s movie musical made in 2016 its an absolutely romantic experience in every sense of the word romantic in its visual scope blazing off of the silver screen in technicolor romantic in its gushing devastating appreciation for the art of jazz romantic in the onscreen chemistry between gosling and stone who make a sizzling hot couple for our times i got a seldonlockwood vibe for sure weve all heard the hype this film has been getting and its for a pretty good reason they dont make em like this anymore damn right they dont resurrects an era of filmmaking that many have thought to be long dead its reinvigorated a filmgoing spirit that once dominated the entire industry and by any luck might just dominate it once again you can thank damien chazelle who in one decade cemented his name into film legend and may almost certainly walk home with a shining oscar this yearso with all of this in perspective did the film blow me away sadly i have to report that it just didnt give me that perfect experience that i wanted its a great film without question but the problem is ive seen this musical singing in the rain is my favorite musical of alltime ive had that lighter than air skip in my step heart singing feeling before and its a onceinalifetime kind of thing many people especially millennials will be feeling this for the first time with and that is something that i deeply respect its remarkable that films can still do this to people in our jaded desensitized and often cruel world perhaps this is what people needed after enduring the unusually dark and divisive year that was 2016 a film like this needed to come along and lift our spirits up and thats precisely what doesits a feelgood romp and we get this right as the film opens with an absolutely swinging musical number on top of a disgustingly busy la highway i loved loved loved the music its absolutely the films strength above all else id give it two years time before ends up becoming a hit broadway musical that gives hamilton a run for its money oh yes its that good,happy
is without a doubt one of the best musicals ever made not being much of fan of this genre it blew me away when i saw the original trailer for this film in theaters and learned damien chazelle was directingdirector of whiplash i had to see it and boy did it deliver told in the forms of seasons the films seamless editing and cinematography is a marvel to observe lengthy complicated and choreographed takes show off the talent ryan gosling and emma stone have stone giving in my opinion the best performance of here career goslings performance is second only to drive or perhaps the nice guys the score by justin hurwitz is once again astonishing chazelles love for jazz holds true in this film its interesting that the two films ive seen by him both mention jazz as a dying art an art he is helping keep alive with his brilliant film making the whiplash nods were wonderful with the doubletime swing followed by a bass player and the talk of charlie parker as the bird the jk simmons cameo had the crowd grinning nicely as well still playing a hardass persona in conclusion is one of the best made performed and creative films of the year it is an inspiring work of art that begs its viewers to seize the day and follow their dreams get out and see this one,happy

rating  out of 5this film is highly recommended in brief an enchanting modern day love story set to musicgrade asynopsis set in modern day la two dreamers sing dance and fall in lovejims review who says they dont make movies like they use to damien chazelles restores ones fate in the creative process and modern day filmmaking a daring and thrilling project the film is a simple boy meets girl tale set in tinseltown that harks back to the kind of musical that mgm would churn out regularly in days of yore this homage to the old hollywood musical is simply a class act all the way and boy do we need it nowthey meet cute these starcrossed lovers caught in a traffic jam one that begins our story with such skill and exuberance this unexpected opening dance number efficiently sets the right tone for the film mixing realism with musical fantasy special kudos to mandy moores spellbinding choreography her opening number another day of sun is a stunner and the camera angles swoop and spin with such fluidity as do the dancers jacques demys the young girls from rochefort is its direct inspirationand there will be other musical salutes throughout the filmof course we know the two will eventually get together against all odds singing their way into your heart mia emma stone an outofwork actress and sebastian ryan gosling a jazz pianist have destiny guiding their every move and fortunately mr chazelle doing the samethe songs by justin hurwitz and lyricists benj pasek and justin paul are clever moving and highly memorable they bring with them the necessary range of emotion that advance the plot so effortlessly bittersweet moments love and heartbreak dreamy romance the haunting love theme city of stars and ms stones 11 oclock number the audition the fools who dream are two unforgettable highlights as is the closing number a pastiche that tips its hat to such films as an american in paris casablanca roman holiday and singin in the rain yes this is a movie that will cause one to swoonthe screenplay also by mr chazelle takes our two lovers on a journey that confronts lifes on going question about love relationships and art it literally sweeps you off your feet and send you into space with a sense of giddy nostalgia and joyous surprise yes the plot is paper thin some of the musical numbers seem forced and do not blend with the reality surrounding our lovers yet the overall effect is still captivatingthe core to the movies success or failure is firmly in control due to the performances of the two lead actors both ms stone and mr gosling have shown that they have a strong chemistry together in other films but here it is so crucial to the film that we buy into their romance some may not i did totally call me a romantic while ms stones and mr goslings musical talents are limited and rarely come near the superior footwork of astaire rogers charisse or kelly the two actors are more than competent and quite charming in their roles they compensate with their strong dramatic acting choices that impress and emotionally involve the moviegoing audiencemr chazelle stages his scenes with flair and style he transitions from dramatic scenes into musical numbers with ease the physical production dazzles with its technicolor dreamscape of pulsating candycolored hues linus sandrens cinematography is gorgeous and the production design by david waco uses the old time movie sets to create the artificial world of movie musicals i particularly loved a lovely night a tribute to the dancing in the dark sequence from the bandwagon complete with lampposthonors the lavish hollywood musicals of the past those rare breed of movies that became extinct as moviegoers tastes changed let us hope this film brings about a renaissance of sorts is a film about love and made with love it is a exhilarating cinematic experience not to be missed,happy
the performances in are spectacular not only do ryan gosling and emma stone sing the hell out of these songs but they also have to dance and act at the same time their chemistry was some of the best ive seen this year and it really made the movie there was so much great playful banter between the two that it made you fall in love with them as characters gosling and stone really knocked it out of the park with this one but i think the true star of the film is damien chazelle as of right now he is my personal pick for best director this year everything about this movie was excellently directed the elaborate musical moments with tracking shots and complex dance moves were done with ease the personal moments between gosling and stone were filmed to highlight the intimacy the music montages were filmed to entertain entirely there isnt a dull frame in this movie,happy
this is my first review and after watching it is one the one i wanted to begin with firstly for the separate category paying attention to the cinematography it was very well shot the main theme is pretty catchy and stays with you the whole movie and direction is brilliantthe over all reason it did so well considering the script wasnt perfectand keeps you entertained stopping certain scenes in particularly from becoming dullthe missing of better sub plot or sub storys was a let down and characters around had a small amount of characterisations which im sure wasnt completely necessary but it is something the audience would love to of seen the main characters have little change and i hate to say it but for someone that judges acting it was quite brilliant on the contrary the movie needed those actors full of joy great energy and life in themseeing this is damien chazelles third movie i am completely impressed whiplash was better though to see such an enthusiastic approach to film you can see that deeper meaning to him and you just know that the love for music can make viewers love the music or drums in his other movie finally yes it had missing links yes the ending wasnt the best and the conflict was a bit messy but it was so fun to watch enthralling original and oscar worthy for sure the dancing and singing is a great idea for a modern film and what i love about it is most audiences can watch it older people and younger as well as in the middle because it is just like that and that is what im sure the non self indulgent damien was aiming for if i had to say one more thing it would be work on the script a little bit more but in general if you want an experience of the moment that you may not remember in time this is a great one to watch,happy
i had never watched a musical before and i thought this was not going to be my thing but i gave it a shot because this is made by the same director of one of my all time favorite films and also the cast the movie is beautiful its made for us the people with big dreams and that are often threatened to give them up it shows us that regardless of all the bad things that we might experience during our long journeywe can still make them our dreams come true it sounds clichlike the typical drama films you probably have watched but it shows that in a different way i thought i wasnt going to be able to relate to this movie cause it has been called a movie for those who love happinessi personally enjoy dark and touching films but this movie is magical itll surely give you and utterly gorgeous mix of emotions and no matter how hard i try to find words to explain this movie they wont give it justice watch it,happy
i went to watch this film without any expectation and knowledge of the film all i knew that it is a musical and is directed by damien chazelle i loved whiplash and that is the only reason i went to watch this film i am not a fan of musicals in fact this is the first musical i watched starts with a song and a very retro setup this reflects in the whole movie later the movie is a romantic one but not a lovestory it revolves around two main characters sebastian an aspiring jazz musician who loves old jazz style and in do not like how people are moving away from it letting it die and mia a struggling actress who grew up watching old hollywood movies and have always fantasize about being an actress these are the only two characters we see in the whole film jk simmons have the 3rd highest screen time that also last for around 5 minutes in two shorts this can seem weird but it is not actually because in this way the director has a lot of time and space for the main characters to tell their story how they meet how their relationship starts and what happens next which is important for a romantic film both the characters are very well defined and damien chazelle have explained each of their back story and completed the setup in first 20 minutes or so of the film not sure about the actual timing this is what i felt as the film progresses we get to see that their struggle in the city of hollywood this films tell story of two lovers who understand support and help each other in achieving them their dreams something which we all desire but difficult to find however in the end they did not endup together that show the harsh reality that you might not get everything that you desire or to put it in a better way that things dont workout the way we want the set design costume and lighting are extraordinarily well they give the film a 60s film look this i loved the most about the film it is feast for eyes to watch the setup of old glorious hollywood musicals the costume add to this ryan gosling wearing suits is very nice part because the old jazz players used to wear but also give the movies the old look same goes with emma stone they gave her similar retro style dress colors of their dress were in contrast just likes their characters lighting was used in an exceptional way i have not seen such a brilliant in recent past damien chazelle used lighting to bring the actor in and out of focus in the shots blew my mind as it is such a simple technique yet so effective there is no need to say who good the music was justin hurwitz out did himself damien chazelle is as good writer as he is a director the story and screenplay is overwhelmingly good the movie contains a lot of long single take shots i personally love those as the keep the continuity of the film and as the scene progresses you see the thing unfolding there could not have been a better couple playing these roles than ryan gosling and emma stone both the actors have proved themselves in the industry and have delivered what was expected of them overall this is a must watch and going to be big winner in this years award season each and every minute of the film is enjoyable,happy
fantastic movie its about a jazz pianist gosling and aspiring actress stone who meet and fall in love in la while pursuing their dreams nothing really new storywise and i think were all familiar with the trope of people painstakingly following their dreams in a metropolis and overcoming obstacles along the waythat said i found this movie absolutely mesmerizing wont comment much on the musicality since i dont watch many musicals but the songs are catchy and goslingstone sing well as anyone whos seen crazy stupid love knows these two have really good chemistry and this movie definitely benefits from two great characters who are charming and endearingthe cinematography is gorgeous the choreography and set pieces are great the acting is sincere pretty much everything about this movie is well executed if you appreciate well made movies or entertaining musicals i think youll like this one and as an added bonus if you enjoy jazz and heartfelt melancholic romances like i do youll love this movie,happy
i particularly see this movie as the 2016 iconic one the atmosphere is so right the actors play seamlessly the music left me speechless and i have to admit that i arrived by mistake at this film because if i knew it was a musical i would have thought twice that being said i admit that this will be one of my favourites from now on it s not the best played movies of all times but what makes it special it s the amount of thoughts it lets behind after you reach the end it s been two days since i saw it and im haunted by the theme song and how life leads you to certain places if you re a dreamer and you had a passion once this movie will definitely touch you in your deepest places don t lose this piece of art whatever people say ,happy
i remember when the first trailer hit the youtube and i told my sister that this will be a great movie and i am feeling proud that i was right  though i also predict same for collateral beauty i havent watched it yet but reviews are not good wow how could i define the experience that gave me in words the movie is exceptionally great and it has all the potential to become a classic film like casablanca i really admire damien chazelle work in whiplash but in this movie he tried something new though he decide to go with the musical element and my god he nailed it this is a very unconventional way to told a story but they really did it well the tone in the entire film kept quite a great balance between humor and emotion it has a perfect combination of tone that make this movie great this movie is undoubtedly a masterpiece great story great direction great cinematography i dont think movie has any flaw its really a flawless movie this movie is surely one of my favorite movie of all time this is just a perfect film,happy
its shot in cinemascope its big on pizazz its packed with bold color schemes the stage lights appear straight out of a dream its big one minute and quiet the next and every song and tune will replay in your head days after its all over no youre not in the 1950s and no youre not in kansas anymore this is the presentday reality so forget about those loud action movies with no respect for the stage proves what can and should be done with the long lost art that is the moving picturethe joyful musical genre has been in the hollywood cemetery for too long now but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story which director damien chazelle whiplash achieves with expert choreography while he may give southern california a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge he still recaptures the same zest of west side story while cranking the spectacle up a notch its always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing disney channel cheese but damien chazelle has done itwithin chazelles cinematic recreation of southern california he fastens our seat belts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons starting at the heat of christmas one is a rubyred aspiring actress who cannot land an audition and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet the other is a fred astairedooley wilson mashup whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano no matter what his boss wants him to play after they first meet over road rage at rush hour these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental runins day after day everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moononce we learn about what these two have in common boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship he wants to revive jazz as a modern art form but she cannot stand listening to it and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year it is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they dont even matteryet its not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment on their first formal meeting she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight as if shes glancing into his own little world on second formal meeting they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight on the first date they are swept off their feetliterally to a dance against the stars in a planetarium on the tenth date they sing an oscarworthy duet as time goes by the dream of making it to the top of the world in paris quickly diminishes her tears swell up along with the audiences ill even admit i choked up as well and im a manthis wide variety of tone in music is plentiful yet wisely spare celebrating the history of cinema magic while wishing the best for its future yet also like the oldies it writes its love to there are one too many white players in the production there are two african americans cast but as dancers on the pier who say not a word just as blacks were stereotyped in that golden age of hollywood if this production was less focused on making a musical spectacular and more focused on showing care and attention to todays mediafrenzied audience then there would have been a better likelihood for this to surpass those repetitive comic book movies at the box officei sincerely hope for the day when people return to their senses and offer their money to movies because of their cinematic quality other than their branding considering how much music is now taking over our culture we could use that reminder of how much music raises our selfesteem when times are hard after seeing what can do with both old and new styles of filmmaking i can absolutely assess that i love musicals all over again therefore i encourage everyone to go see this magical delight to raise the spirits for 2017 after all tomorrow is another day,happy
its so surreal is the sentiment of my crossdimensional trip to throughout the journey my modes of transport constantly switch from land to air without a prior notice as the jazz was blaring and songs were impeccably cutting in it was a ride like no other shifting elegantly from reality to dreams and evoking the nostalgia of singin in the rain the transition is just so perfect that youd adore how fantasy was woven into life to the point which you might have to scream your lungs out goddamn it this is too beautiful for me to handlei wouldve literally screamed when the movie was about to start because some people around my seat were talking and commenting like they were some godlike movie experts whom everybody else was eager to seek opinions from shut up you insensitive selfcentered conversationalists thankfully the scene jingled instantly and riveted me from all nuisances i thought i knew what kind of movie i was expecting when the drivers stomped out of their vehicles hopped on the roofs and performed an upbeat song in the middle of traffic my feet were tapping on their own accord and i couldnt wait to see the main characters singing out their stories but unlike other movies in which the characters express feelings in a fabulous way the song halted and everyone just returned to their cars like nothing had occurred the musical intention unfolded itself the songs dont tell the story they are the storyim not going to bother you with the plot because i think everyone should approach this movie without a clue trust me the story is so simple that you may not give it a second thought but the way the mastermind behind whiplash told it is enthralling one of my most favorite scenes is when mia came to her movie audition and was asked to improvise a story the transition of lights and speech to music was so good that youll resent me if i provide more detail and i wont heres to the ones who dream sang mia i feel that it was more of a message for those who dont so bring on the rebels  the roles from pebbles  the painters and poets and plays it was like a protest to confront a materialistic society to not give up on dreamers their hope and imaginative contributions that was the whole point of follow your dreams and dont care what others think the concept is old but im glad people like damien chazelle still believe in it and encourage everybody else to bravely pursue the path of the foolsthe ending is either wonderful or sad or wonderfully sad or sadly wonderful depending on your own perspective it brings back to my mind the memories of the casablanca especially the playitsam moment and that unforgettable ending in which ilsa had to choose between getting in the plane with victor lazslo or staying with rick blaine i just simply cant put my thoughts into words when the last shot of faded,happy
classical cinema sensibilities collide with 21st century realities in damien chazelles the whiplash filmmaker follows up that highly acclaimed effort with its tonal opposite a breezy colorful romance wrapped in original songs and musical numbers while something feels contradictory about combining a contemporary independent comedy with an old hollywood movie musical chazelle blends the two with visual ingenuity and strives for the utmost artistic integrity the result is a wholly unique albeit strangely familiar moviegoing experiencethe 31yearold chazelle has made a couple things clear in his short but noteworthy career thus far he really loves movie musicals and he really really loves jazz jazz music has played an integral role in all three of his features and two of his films have featured original song performances follows aspiring actress mia emma stone who keeps having fated encounters with jazz pianist sebastian ryan gosling until their hollywoodbased romance blooms and they challenge each other to pursue their dreams in new waysthe film goes heavy on the music early on as if to announce itself as a full on musical it opens with a rousing number during gridlock traffic on the la freeway another day of sun intended to look like a single take full of sweeping camera movements bright colors and diverse faces not long after we see mia musically preparing for a night out with her roommates someone in the crowd in stereotypical fashion a number that ends in a choreographed pool party sequence yet these are two of the five original songs in the entire film in other words chazelle didnt start his film that way just to be cuteonce mia and sebastian finally connect on a sunset stroll that results in tapdancing a lovely night the musical numbers slow down and what few new songs remain are of the soulsearching introspective variety chazelle organizes the film in seasons and the tone changes as we go from winter to spring to summer to fall so while he begins the film in a showy way creating an idyllic portrait of hollywood and romance the story slowly accumulates more depth and we see the characters their relationship and their struggles more clearlystone and goslings onscreen chemistry has already been proved twice before crazy stupid love gangster squad and that makes chazelles job much easier having movie musical chemistry and screen presence is a whole other beast however and in this regard stone really steals the show gosling looks unbelievably sharp and he clearly devoted a lot of time to his piano skills in preparation for his role but hes more cool than charming almost too cool perhaps thats by design but stone has the singing starlet aura shes effortless to watch and love qualities that gosling has but not to the same degree and not in a way thats utterly transportingboth actors however provide exactly what needs in terms of being a contemporary comedy both have excellent comedic credentials and dramatic chops their performances embody the fine line between playful humor and emotional honesty that reflects how millennials see themselves in the world and lest we forget amidst all the oldtimey flair in this film that chazelle brings a millennial perspective to the directors chairpart of that perspective is that movies like these  especially musicals  are far too rosy they create unrealistic expectations those of us who grew up with this art and internalized its fantasies as truths or ideal to strive for have felt burned this is a particularly common theme among contemporary films and tv shows but chazelle is really the first to address it from a place of deep love and intimate knowledge of the genre to satirize and provide effective commentary on a genre you kinda need to master it in its most classical form and chazelle demonstrates impeccable skill in this regardwe already knew from whiplash that chazelle could film people playing music in an electrifying way hes sure to make the worlds best music documentary someday but the way hes able to break out of the twodimensional viewpoint that most musical directors even movie musical directors fall prey to and craft visually compelling musical numbers warrants all the awards attention hes already getting for this filmisnt emotionally sweeping like most people want from a romantic musical but its honest message and craftsmanship elevate it from an interesting experiment of blending old school with new school into a powerful reminder of what it really means to love and what it really means to dream bigsteven cthanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more,happy
this film is a gem i cant express enough how much i love this film as a person thats not so much into musicals i can finally say that i loved a musical is an ode to jazz but not just jazz its an ode to all the artists from musicians to actors and actresses the struggle of those who want to achieve better things to those who have dreams i can truly say that this film is by far my favorite and the best film of 2016 both actors emma stone who plays an aspiring actress and ryan gosling who plays a musician that plays jazz on the piano bot characters were fleshed out and both performances delivered this film is not only about music but the romance is very strong in this film both actors have played and worked together in other films before but as of now nothing beats the performance they showed in this film this film is being played in limited cinemas and the reason being is because the studio wanted this film to be a contender for the oscars for those that want to wait it will have a wide release in januaryi would not be surprised if emma stone get a nomination for best lead actress she is phenomenal and i wouldnt be surprised if ryan gosling gets a nomination as well plus the film for best screenplay and for best motion picture i cant express enough how good emma stone is in this picture she truly shines and stands out in this picture i highly recommend this film you will not take away from the movie and you will definitely love the music that the film revolves around my only problem with the film was the ending its nothing bad of sort its still amazing and wonderful but it messed with my heart and my feelings were hurt it messes with concept of what if once people get see this movie they will understand but regardless if you like musicals mixed with heavy romance and comedy this film is must see 9810,happy
this is a normal review from a normal average viewer of movies i say this is nonbiased because i dont rant and rave over musicals nor do i actually enjoy them on a regular basisi went with my wife to see this movie on a date night the opening scene was a traditional break into dance sequence that was kind of a turn off but after that the movie got betterthe acting was great as gosling and stone are always good in their roles not to mention their chemistry on screen was fantastic as always they are just really believable as a couplethe director couldnt have picked two better actors to portray the roles on screenthere was quite a bit of singing and some dancing on screen but hearing it from stone and gosling made it believable the music and score were enjoyable and the story itself was hard to beatso if youre someone who enjoys good acting and a great story i would highly recommend it and if youre someone who doesnt typically enjoy musicals i would still encourage you to check it out especially if youre a guy looking to take your wifegf to a nice flick youd be silly not to take them to this movie because its a great story and has ryan gosling she will be smiling for daysi predict it will definitely win some awards come oscar season,happy

in short this movie is another hollywood echochamber its saturated with selfreferences and channeling itself so out of touch with reality and narcissistic quite symptomatic really thank god they gave us a clue in the name of their movie for us to have a grasp what this movie is about just by looking at its namethe only reason these two mentally ill dissociated characters fell in love with each other in the first place is because they realized this is what they had in common mental illness and dissociation so why the hell not be like this together better than to go through life alone with such misery anyway other than that these two characters are stripped of any personality to be fair many classics of musicals this movie was trying hard to channel are guilty of thatjust like in many musicalsromantic comedieshollywood tropes these two people were thrown out at each other artificially let me get this straight i dont know any woman who would memorize a guy like sebastian and believe theyre meant to be together despite the fact that all she knows about him is that once he showed her middle finger and was shaking his head at her in a car and later he shoved her aside while she was trying to compliment his piano play it just doesnt work like thatit was good at mechanistically channeling musicals and hollywood but it was doing so unenthusiastically i know that musical movies tend to have lack of good singing because they usually take famous actors with little to no musical background to play but in this case maybe the film could benefit from better singing and dancing if the script and idea were so bad and no sebastian youre not playing jazz youre just playing one mediocre pop song that is styled as vintagebig theme of this movie is follow your dreams which almost always happens to be a dream of making it in the entertainment industry for some reason as if people who watch this cant dream of something other than that its interesting that many hollywood and disney movies have been having this clich theme throughout decades big question whyi kind of get it why many people received this movie well and believed all the hype and that it deserved oscars one of the reasons is of course because they just eat whatever is being fed to them by hollywood and mainstream all the time another one is that large portion of society lives in this in our capitalist society people are alienated from reality and they live in a fantasy major corporations create for them to escape they also dream about mythical love and having a dreamlike career even their dreams are not something they created im saying all that because i recommend you to read zizeks review of,happy
they say a great work of art makes you feel something still im not convinced this is what they had in mind because this movie this movieits about hollywood and its about music and art and dreams and about chasing all of those its set in the modern times oddly enough yet its style and way of talking way of experiencing is straight from the olden times its hollywood nostalgia at its finest from the big showstopper musical numbers to its characters and stereotypes and storiesand i love it both the main characters with emma stone and ryan gosling giving careerdefining performances their romance their differences their passions all of them exhilarating and you could spend decades strolling down the streets and boulevards singing songs in smoky clubs basking in the sun that shines just for themand i hate it for every musical piece of genius theres a number that makes me feel manipulated for every moment of such beauty that it makes me tremble and wish to be a better poet to express it properly theres a moment when you want to take the movie by the throat and demand whats wrong with it why is it they way it is why does it insist on dragging itself down with its melancholy and forced realismon and on it goes and by the end i was left exhausted by conflicting emotions with such minor changes i could have had a movie that would have inspired me for years to come yet what i hate about the film also makes it stronger because what i hate are not flaws but differing ideals because while this film is all about hollywood nostalgia and dreams its also about that which was always left outside when talking about those things and thats not something i can argue againstso heres to the dreamers but also those that wake up in the morning those that fail those that dont achieve their dreams and heres to those that keep on dreaming,happy
this movie just brings a breeze from the old times when you would see mary poppins going all the way down stairs all those performers in all that jazz hell it even reminded me of jim carrey as the mask dancing mamboin many aspects there are highlights i would mention in particular i really missed seeing long shots for a single scene with a superb performance i would definitely like to watch again some of them more carefullyperhaps the way the story is unfolded might be classic but in many other ways its intriguing and surprising eventuallythe actors did an excellent work in this movie i laughed i felt sad i felt frustrated i felt happy i cried i got angry i screamed i started pulling the hair on my head the mix of the story the performance and the music really made me feel part of that world except at some points you will figure out a lot of emotional work can be felt hereabout the music i think i started hearing it everywhere its so lively and colorful it is just life as it is mr hurwitz must have gone through really tough nights playing composing experimentingthe end of the movie i think its fantastic it just speaks by itself i think it has been made so easy to understand for most of audiences and it transmits quite a strong message or twoi will probably want to watch this movie again in a few months or a year just to go through all this story and all these feelings one more time but its going to be hard to forget,happy
is a musical that tells the story of three different loves stories mia stone and sebastian gosling developing a romantic relationship set in hollywood the other two love stories revolve around mia and sebastians love for their respective career choices mia with acting and sebastian with jazz music both of them are struggling to make it in the world but as they gain momentum their romantic relationship starts to disintegrate this is a story that has been done before sebastian wants to own his own jazz club but is struggling to make money because the world around him wants him to compromise his taste of music with popular current music mia wants to make it as an actress but cannot take rejection after rejection after rejection however subverts the musical genre and gives the characters some great songs and great characterization ryan gosling and emma stone are great in the roles especially emma stone they still have great chemistry even after 2 movies gangster squad and crazy stupid love and for people who have never really sung before they do an great job but they are not the real stars of the movie the real star is setting hollywoodhollywood is beautifully shot in the movie the direction and cinematography are immaculate stellar use of long takes and moving cameras and used to show the beauty of the city the city is really able to become its own character it does almost become the antagonist of the story for both mia and sebastian not only for their dreams and aspirations but also for their relationship it is almost hypnotizing how the film almost draws you into the scene not only with the setting but also the songs the songs are well done they give off an aura of old time classic 1950s music but also sound modern enough for young people to enjoy however the use of music sometimes overstays its welcomeis around two hours long but honestly it doesnt need to be there are some scenes that just feel like they were included because they look pleasing to the eye and they do however it does not justify its means of existing the scenes where mia and sebastian are falling in love last around ten to fifteen minutes but feel like thirty and contain no dialogue so it can actually be done in around five minutes of screen time there are a myriad of dance breaks which are supposed to show the chemistry between mia and sebastian but there are at least three scenes that already do that before they finally spark a connection also as for other flaws some of the lip singing done by supporting members of the cast for example mias roommates or the people singing another day of sun are pretty transparent and while i do think the ending was poignant and sticks true to the overall message of the film i could do without the final montageoverall is a very enjoyable time at the movies if you love musicals you will have a blast with this one if you dont like musicals you will probably hate this but you could enjoy it for the beautiful shots scenery and acting out of the two movies directed by damien chazelle i do prefer whiplash but the movie is still very engaging i never found my self escaping to my very own,happy
spoilers many people despise for copying iconic themesscenes from famous musicals throughout the years but putting those speculations aside the film successfully displays human nature in a way most movies have not which could be one reason why people felt outraged or disappointed many of these following comments came from friends and family who debated about the film the fact that ryan and emma werent the best professional singers actually added to the realistic theme as it made the characters that much more easy to relate to if they were the best singers their struggle for their dreams would seem not as difficult one of the greatest lines in the movie that really resonated in my mind was sebastian exclaiming they worship everything and value nothingthis single line sums up the entire movie as the value of jazz is what drives sebastian and acting is valued so much by mia this can also be put into context over our culture i would be so bold as to say that this is the generation we live in today a culture that worships everything but has lost the true sense of value the culture worships famous people beauty money and has lost sight of personal human value there is strong truth in the words of sebastian the film does a great job in making other movie references old trends in fashion and music as well as incorporating places that are popular today that will make this movies nostalgic in the future the film also did not have any sex scenes contrary to most films of this generation it depicted a relationship that came through friendship and showed a relationship of valuing lives instead of using another person referencing the end when sebastian encouraged mia to follow her dreams of acting in paris the film inspires people to passionately follow their dreams which is not seen that much in recent films is a film that respects the dignity of humanity and is very easy to relate to any audience,happy
i did not except to fall in love with this movie but im glad i havei thought that the musical scenes were great especially the cinematography and score gosling and stone are both topnotch in this and it quite relates to my love and passion of making movies this movie deserves the oscars it had won but best picture boy was i ticked off this didnt win best picture  it did at first but it was a mistakein general i consider this to be one of my favorite movies out of all of 2016 the definition and embodiment of disappointment after disappointment,happy
lala land is one of the most awarded pictures of all times and it comes to us in a time when the world is in such state with religious political economical and social wars that contribute to the world crisis the movie is based on a young girl that wants to make it in the movie business life in hollywood with the constant chase for a major roll and to have a life changing experience and become famous all she needs is one chance to change her destiny as we watch the movie with all the colours and music we can appreciate what life is through jazz its music takes us to another level where we try to fight for our survival to have our 5 seconds of solo fame and then to mingle with the other instruments that complement our purpouse in existence life is about being in the world with all the kind of people that makes us hear they way we sound the parallelism in both lives the struggle the dreams the project and the talent shows us that anyone can do it but if we arent willing to share the dream and make sacrifices then we may travel different that is what happens to the main characters they fell in love but didnt share any of their passions to make it work thats why we see two versions of their love life what you are willing to give to be successful the taste of freedom in this movie shows us the things we choose in the present affects the things to come in the future the happy ending is all about us here and now httpspensarparaserfelizwordpresscom20170306lalalandand freedom,happy
to my mind is an incredible movie full of romance  charm  suspense and lovealso the acting from both emma and ryan is heartbreakingdefinitely worth winning the oscar emmakeep goingall of youdamien chazelle created such an amazing love storyfinally the part that mostly impressed me was the ending scene because it showed us that life is unpredictable and is not a fairy tale,happy
im a huge musicals fan and i went into this film expecting something quite special there was so much buildup so much hype the opening sequence was incredible despite my not being able to understand the lyrics most of the time the dance sequence was a joy to watch so i sat back and was ready to be impressed it didnt happenbasically a romance the story was passable ryan goslings character being a jazz zealot asswipe made him difficult to like it fell into a massive hole about twothirds in where the audience drifted off the ending well it was just awfulthe singing was very average neither gosling or stone have great singing voicesthe music which lets face it is quite important in a musical was a major disappointmenti loved the dancing the locations the use of vivid colors and many other things but these werent enough to offset the lackluster music and singingthe people watched this film may not have seen the classic musicals from decades ago perhaps thats why the imdb score is so high i hope that starts a resurgence in the musical genre if it does they will have to be much better than this effort,happy
in all honesty this movie made me so happy its been a while since such a good movie has presented itself to me and did not disappoint im not a huge fan of musicals to be honest but i would not change a thing in this movie is really worth a watch and if you dont watch it youre really missing out on a great experience,happy
how can one give negative reviews on this movie its pure unadulterated entertainment from the opening to the closing i was fully and completely entertained isnt that what movies are about guys come on of course i realise there are people who like to watch people disembowel other people to them thats entertainment to me its not ethel merman didnt have that in mind im sure anyway a great movie very entertaining worth every cent of the 12 to get in and the 20 for a snack there criticism happy,happy
i think was a great film it had excellent cinematography and never cut a shot while a song was being sung and it totally deserved best cinematography and damien chazelle was just an amazing director congrats to emma stone on winning best actress she deserved it ryan gosling did an amazing job too it was a big upset for at the oscars but moonlight did a great job too,happy
i finally saw this film last night 353017 it seems to be a musical calculated to attract millennials who have never heard of singing in the rain or any of the other great musical films that ostensibly inspired this one i have read so much about what a wonderful musical this is but i thought the music was tepid the songs did not do anything to elaborate on the story or move it forward at key pivot points which i always thought was an essential hallmark of the musical i found emma stone to be a truly awful singer ryan gosling was only a little better i also found their personal chemistry to be lackingi never believed in the relationship that the two characters were having they made such a big deal about jazz in this film but i think all the music was original no nod to even a single jazz classic and it was jazz written by pop music composers like oh lets have a trumpet solo here that will make it sound like jazz also i feel like a musical should be a romcom and not have a bittersweet ending that makes your wife cry and that endingit seems like anything that was important happened in that five years later period that they jumped over i felt like the movie was over just as the groundwork had been laidi would have liked this movie better if they had not tried to turn it into a musical and had shown us a little more character development,happy
being a guy whos just so so on musicals i heard this was a very good movie but i though its not my genre wow i did not want it to end best movie ive seen  the most entertained that ive been  in several years the story the writing the actors the music all just fantastic first off the movie is upbeat and fun if you need depression in your life go see manchester by the sea which i did not get at all there really isnt that much dancing in this movie but the music is great very memorable songs then gosling and stone as one of the most believable couples on screen ever great plot and gosling very impressive on the keyboards and emma stone gives a wonderful performance to be honest i havent seen moonlight and i heard its also terrific but i have a hard time believing its better than lll if you want a date movie this one will so get the job done but see it for any reason then see it again,happy
so what is the big deal about is it really just overrated hollywood garbagelet me just start off by saying that i went to see with an open mind as you should with any film i entered the movie theatre holding a cocktail mix of polarized reviews varying from those who praised it for its brilliance to others who bitterly criticized it for being an overrated whitewashed film and after finally seeing the movie i was taken aback by how amazing it was where do i begin ill put it this way  i have never been more grateful to experience such a beautiful film in cinema manages to check off all the prerequisites of a wellmade film first off the cinematography is breathtaking the film itself captures the classical charm of a bygone era through so much attention to detail in costume and set designing whilst eloquently integrating these themes into the modern world the richness of the colour and lighting play a huge part in setting the overall tone romanticizing each moment through a retro 20th century movieesque lensalso whoever created the soundtrack for deserves a big highfive from me from hauntingly beautiful heartfelt love songs to vibrant musical numbers the music in this film gave me goosebumps and had me bouncing in my seat thanks guys i now listen to the soundtrack on repeat my two favourite songs are someone in the crowd and another day in the sun and no emma stone is not a professional singer but who cares shes not meant to be she plays an aspiring actress i was impressed with both emma stone and ryan goslings performancethe film resonated with me because it was a story about falling in love and following your dreams and all the adversities that come with it so unless youre a naturally bitter person you will find this visual feast incredibly moving,happy
i came into this movie knowing nothing save the fact that it was a musical what i didnt know was that the movie was so much more it told the story of the two main characters sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stonethe director took two actors who didnt sing or dance and made them sing and dance and they were fantastic the story was incredible and unpredictable i never knew what was going to happen the director understands that film is show not tell and he did it so well the movie was the perfect length the scenes flowed the music fit in and enhanced the story the opening scene set the feeling of the movie so well for the most part the issues that i had didnt take away from the movie save one major problem that for me keeps it from being a 10 the sound quality is quite low especially for a musical it doesnt ever get to the point that you cant understand what anyone is saying but i do feel that the sound quality held back the fantastically written and performed musical numbers,happy
basically ryan gosling and emma stone as a couple in any film should be enough for your half chub to last throughout the movie not a lot to this plot but if you watch gosling im sure you can pick up a few tips for your next date one of those movies you have to watch just to say youve seen it im happy mia and sebastian took their chances at pursuing their passions they probably wouldve got a divorce within a few years anyways the big man,happy
is an incredibly well made movie it is a nod to old hollywood musicals but also a rejection of their traditional and oftentimes predictable story lines to those whove had the pleasure of seeing a broadway musical this movie rings a familiar bell the soundtrack is utterly fantastic and is really worth a buy this film left me feeling feeling happy sad reminiscent unsatisfied as a person wrapped up in the story but very satisfied as a moviegoer,happy
an original musical about two people falling in love while in pursuing their dreams in hollywood the movie sounds pretty generic on paper but then again manages to evoke magic onscreen not possible to write on a piece of paper the chemistry between the leads is undeniable a great contemporary epic through only the daily life scenery and songs the feeling of listening to a great classical score for the first time damien chazelle has somehow made two backtoback utterly unique movies coincidentally revolving around jazz while whiplash was an intense psychological thrillerlike drama is genuinely a funny and heartwarming romantic musicalthis movie breaks the mold in the best picture category this year you will not find the typical oscar baits such as cathartic moments in the storyline melodramatic tragedies powerhouse acting vehicle period pieces biopics or controversial themes yet the movie is pretty overwhelming in only its pacing comedic timing and music it really balances well between comedic and serious moments never taking the easy route to dramaland its remember its about joy hope dreams and lovehighly recommended,happy
i saw but its not even worth 14 nominations i liked the story but ive seen a story like this multiple times the actors were good but not oscarworthy to me its just a simple musical with some nice songs but thats about it its a great movie but only for commercial properties 3 maybe 4 oscarsthats about it if grease was made in this period and in 1978 grease should have 14 nominations now thats one hell of a musicaland timeless,happy
really need someone to tell me a fault in it the best experience i have ever had in the whole year andrew garfield was my favourite performance of the year for hacksaw ridge until i saw this and ryan gosling became my favourite as amy adams for her performance in arrival till i saw this and emma stone became my favourite one cmon give them both and goddam oscar for this movie and both songs of this movie anf they are city of stars and the fools who dream are enough to carry a whole movie season thank u so much damien chazelle for writing and directing this masterpiece this movie has to get at least 11 or 14 oscar nominations and has to win best movie and ill give it 1010,happy
this film is pure art the cast the filming the score everything is done perfectly its feel really natural that can touches you authentically the performance on the piano is all ryan so that makes the movie even better besides it has an incredible cinemascope look and it is shot on film amazing work in every single way,happy
i have the fortunemisfortune of my best friend living in the usa so she sees everything before me and often says you must go and see this i had to go and see this aside from the fact that the goslingstone combo is golden and individually they are brilliant i had the recommendation from stateside i am biased in that i very much admire ryan gosling and emma stone and i love all things los angeles and oldyworldy hollywood but someone told me before i went that lll isnt set in the golden age of hollywood  the 1940s  its set in modern day hollyweird shocker what did this mean from the opening scene i had a stupid grin on my face and it only left when i was crying such is the emotional rollercoaster of this film it is the golden years of hollywood because it transports you to another world where singing and dancing are normal and love is forever and two people are starcrossed to be together and its sunny and people wear bright colours and pretty dresses and proper suits still its a hollywood where gosling and stone shine and are playing characters that seem so natural to them the fact that ryan had to learn to play piano like that for the film defies belief its a beautiful film a love song to los angeles but also a stark portrait of hollywood as well the competition the broken dreams the fakery the traffic jams and the disappointmenttwo wannabes  stone an aspiring actress and gosling an aspiring jazz musician meet by chance and are wildly unsuitable for each other but it works both are smitten and motivated to chase the other and each pushes the other with their dreams it is beautiful endearing but also gut wrenchingly sad and challenging these people knew exactly what they wanted from life and they bared all figuratively and went for it what is in my life that is like that what dreams do i have did i have i thought about it for days afterwards that and the beautiful and haunting musical refrainthe music is wonderful john legend is a legend and seeing him in the film was icing on the cake and goslings piano playing is just beautiful the sets and locations whether the back lot at universal or whichever studio it was the griffith observatory or out on the road were all perfect and costume and direction all the ducks were lined up in a row to be brilliant so many homages to past hollywood films little in jokes which i didnt get but read about so much depth and twists for once a hollywood film without a hollywood ending but it was more hollywood because of that i loved it i get why some people didnt those without the childlike suspension of disbelief and inability to see fantasy and imagine another world or see metaphor seems you either adore it or say meh im not sure it is worthy of all the oscar nods if im being honest yes it was dancing and singing and fantasy and real life and hollywood and period and modern and all things to all los angeles but it wasnt taxing or a stretch for these actors but perhaps it was the nod to things past the feelings it engendered the emotional rollercoaster what films are meant to be about the story within the story within the film the film as story and as narration which makes it more than the sum of its parts and the bareness and frankness of the characters i think it is one of those films that will be studied to peel back the onion layers of director damien chazelles vision go see for yourself,happy
i am not fun of musicals and very few movies have ever blown me away  the original star wars matrix  pulp fiction to name a few  and apart from pulp fiction i have never watched twice the same movie again within 24h now i have a second move on this list  is this the best dance act i have ever seen not bad but definitely not is this the best singing i have ever seen note bad but definitely not but beyond that this movie has it all its dynamic the cinematography is truly superb emma stone is irresistible clearly the best on screen ryan gosling is great vibrant music and choreography mixing classics and modern all directed and framed to perfection like a nice bottle of wine it has all the ingredient in just the right proportion to create an elegant ensemble that you cannot stop drinking takes you to a whole different world where you will switch off relax and dream on for two short hours the magic of cinema that only very few and the very best can do clearly one of the best ever  a must see,happy
i have never liked musical movies and i do not bother watching them there are just not my typewhen first came out i did not have any intention in watching it however when i saw the rating of this movie which is quite high for this kind of movies as well as the long list of nominations and awards i was motivated to watch it i was never disappointed i know this is not the best musical or romance movie out there but i need to be fair they did a great job combining romance comedy and music in a wonderful simple story it does not have to be complicated to be good i would say that was great move because not only the romancedrama music and comedy was good but the story itself was simple enough to feel how realistic it is i never felt once that during the movie that rayan and emma were acting it felt like i am watching a real life drama except for the musical parts there is no overacting or overreacting to given situations the story simply felt real and that is why i think people love it,happy
what a movie i have to say that i usually dont read reviews i dont write reviews but this time i liked the movie so much that i felt i need to tell people to go what it before its too late dont get fooled the story goes beyond jazz if you dont like jazz or never tried it this is your opportunity to appreciate it and the story of a man who loves it and a girl who loves what her loved one does not the classical love story certainly you wont regret i still have some of the songs spinning in my head please dont miss it take the love of your life with you certainly a good choice to consider for valentines night date,happy
has been met with great anticipation since everyone has been raving about how great it is admittedly i went into with high expectations considering damien chazelles previous addition whiplash was one of the best films of 2014 fortunately didnt disappoint in the slightestthe film focuses on two young people living in la trying to fulfill their dreams both the jazz pianist and actress meet and develop a charming relationship throughout the picture first of all is a musical a perfectly made modern musical during a time where musicals have found appreciation only if they were released before the 80s recharges the genre that has been so prominent to the magic of cinema everything about this film boasts love life passion and fun pure and unapologetic movie magic thats just fun anyone who adores the art of filmmaking can recommend this to anyone wondering why are movies so great this is why no matter how hard someone may try to dislike this movie its difficult to deny the wonder and pure movie magic this film has to offerryan gosling and emma stone both create excellent chemistry on screen together and present some of the best performances of their careers performances are quite excellent all across the board in fact which brings more life into the picture on another note ryan goslings work in learning the piano for this role also shows remarkable talent considering all the singing dancing and instrument playing is completely genuine for those expecting stage numbers matching singing in the rain or the music man might potentially be disappointed this isnt a 50s musical  its a modern musical and correct expectations is important whats important to know about is its a film specifically for film lovers real genuine film lovers casual moviegoers will also have a grand time if they let themselves but maybe the hype has doomed some film goers experience for anyone thatll have a good time with this joyful experience theyre in for a magnificent and dreamworld delight of movie magic thats incredibly enjoyable and pieced together quite perfectly really everyone should get around to seeing the joy that is,happy
we went and saw as a baby step on the long road to recovery following the incident a journey starts with a single step unless you are driving although most folk walk to a car but what if that initial walk is away from your destination i dont know i dont care just put it in for the pedantsthe movie is about a struggling jazz musician no surprises there is there any other kind the only surprise is that he doesnt seem to be a smack freak he plays christmas music in a place where he has to give himself tips he is unhappy fortunately the gozza has a permanent preternaturally bleak look about himthere is also a struggling actress played by the stoner who is good at crying and this is fortunate because her life as a struggling actress is as potholed as a port moresby road mebbe theyve improved dunnothe movie starts off with a big production number that is reminiscent of a pepsi max ad with bucket loads of young wild yet oddly responsible young people dancing and singing and generally making the best of a bad situation in my experience both as an observer and an historical actual young person this just doesnt happen without alcohol and drugs and almost always ends badly with one vomitfilled shoe bruises and no underwear i hate pepsi max ads and their ilkanyway they meet and there are production numbers and jazz concerts and auditions and successes and failures before they both became wildly successful most of the music was unfamiliar to me i did recognise aha and flock of seagulls but they were peripheral i am not proud of thisthey fall in love those who wish to see macguffies will be disappointedthere are lot of flash backs and these had me for one confused presenting alternate endings and suchlike if you nod off youll go insane with an absolute hydra of possibilitybut we did enjoy the music and had i been a toetapper these mini digits wouldve been tapping out a machinegun beatthere is dancing too but fredn ginger expectations will be dashed against the rocks of despair still they are bettern me although i have a hip flexor injury and am off the turpswe walked out thinking that it hadnt been a waste of a seniors discount the inlaws were sitting next to us and they liked it too i think not the best movie we have seen but far fromma worst one for the romantics you know who you are,happy
i vote excellent because i judge a movie only from the perspective as a pathetically passive audience member whose only power is either to stay or walk away the movie is excellent because of its integrity it doesnt polish up the actors like they did in earlier days the movie doesnt even bother to make the characters look cool or their abodes look like they were designed by your favorite interior designer what they deal with every day the songbook is this glutenfree is also real if i would be living in la i would go through exactly the same even their romance feels real to me the song and dance parts are of course a manipulated hyperreality but they are real in the sense that they are not trying to dazzle me the audience with impossible moves and tapedup smiles with a little practice i can make those moves failure to become an actress selling out principles experiences are real too but neither falls back to clich behavior like drug use and violence which makes it also real most people move on after they tried the acting thing and become insurance saleswomen and not druggies whats also real is that you have to put yourself out there to get noticed whats also real is that when you want your own club you have to have some earned money in the bank to realize your dream you also have to have people around you who have your back and willing to take that extra step pick you up from colorado to do an important audition its also real that success trumps people in hollywood and although the ending seems confusing its beyond real that people in this hypercapitalistic state we are in opt for money and status over another human being they deeply love i think its cynical but the real clinchers is that if you or i would be in a similar position would we ignore the pain that is tearing apart our heart and pour ourselves into the next song or the next role,happy
la la lands i never right reviews so rave and so focused but probably this movie has made me feel those emotions long lost from crushing pain to fabulous joy of just watching the flow of human emotion with rhythm of music makes one feel elated the whiplash wonder kid has done it again and with right chords if you understand i have seen this movie third time now and never has it failed to feel so close to my heart the sardonic wit by ryan and an array of emotions by emma gives the movie much character and layers for those impulsive lovers and ever romantic do see it before this valentine showing in theater near you ps the apostrophe in the title is for a reason,happy
well where do i start absolutely blown me away and i say this as a male person there is so much this movie does right and i thought several hours about which i didnt like about it the story was very cute and in my opinion not the copypaste love story you always see especially the end gosling and stone perfectly fit to their characters especially gosling surprised me because i hadnt him as a good actor in my mind the soundtrack is as beautiful as the camera work songs that stayed in my mind for days and there were so few cuts in this movie especially the opening scene which seemed to be shot in one take and this is something i absolutely love in movies but i am very brutal in rating movies if there is one thing that i do not like i cant rate it with 1010 and unfortunately there was this one little sequence which do not fit in the whole movie at all you will notice it trust me but in conclusion i can totally recommend this movie to everyone especially when you like music love or a masterpiece in camerawork,happy
what can i say well first off lets make it abundantly clear to everyone that i do not like musicals hate them there is one exception greaseand maybe the rocky horror picture showcause i liked the songs i only went to see cause it won a heap of awards and has been nominated for everything so i figured it cant be all that bad the first 10 minutes for me was painful very painfuldid i mention i dont like musicals i hate that random song and dance it just doesnt make sense to me so i sat there in the theatre watching this painful singing and dancing by random strangers and then emma stone showed up i like emma stone she does that slightly quirkyconfused thing really well and shes pretty then she started singingumm emma you are definitely an actor but then she started dancing ok not too bad this girl can move then ryan gosling showed up i love you ryan gosling i am sure there is nothing that you can do wrong wrong ryan gosling is okay with the dancing but please ryan do not sing ever again ever after lots of gazing into each others eyes emma and ryan formed a connection i would like that connection with ryan hes good at that ithinkimfallinginlovewithyou gazing thing so slowly i started to relax and start enjoying the film the singing got better emma not ryan and the dancing was great the old time romance was lovely to watch this film had a great story line two wannabes in los angeles who meet fall in love but ultimately just want to make it in hollywood that is their goal they just happen to have bumped into each other in the meantime it was only in the last 15 minutes of the film that i decided that i liked the film it is one film that i can confidently say actually doesnt leave anything hanging you dont walk out of the film thinking but what happened withbla bla bla all lose ends get tied up and not that many films manage to do that these days so that is why i liked the film  because it all made sense yes it was set up as an old fashioned musical with some mobile phone text messages thrown in yes those mobile phones reminded you that you werent watching an old film and the film i thought was very arty too with lighting and scenery im glad that i saw it and you should probably see it too you can probably wait for it on dvd or tv as its a musical folks and i dont like musicals,happy
in the last couple of years there had been attempts to make movies that pay homage to cinema and film making like the artist and hugo both movies had what lacked which is an original script and story throughout watching i couldnt help but feeling that the film maker is forcing himself to make a classic like singin in the rain nevertheless there were glimpses in the movie that tried to show originality like when mia tries to talk to seb the second time they meet and he just rushes out of the bar but these were only glimpses until the very end of the movie where the last half an hour showed the movies real potential the whole notion of dreams vs reality and relationships vs passion and self fulfilling careers is very interesting despite the fact the in our current time for a lot of people choosing between passion and relationships is even a luxury not many people posses emma stone performance was brilliant the music and songs were beautiful in addition to excellent cinematography but this is not a film worthy of being labeled a masterpiece,happy
is damien chazelles second major feature following whiplash two years ago the earlier release helped define chazelles cinematic signature a love of jazz highly kinetic cinematography a fondness for chiaroscuro shots sharp editing and tightly focused character relationships expands this signature somewhat adding a broader color palette and accentuating the kinetic visuals with fine and believable choreography in doing so hes created a finelooking and charming musical    so why does it feel like something is missingthe story written by chazelle deals with the relationship between a struggling actress emma stone and a talented but rigidly principled jazz musician ryan gosling as it develops over a year stones character deals with rejection while gosling is tempted with compromised success with the band of a mainstream colleague john legend the relationship between the two evolves believably for the most part thanks to very good performances from gosling and especially stone and largely believable dialogue between them the songs by justin hurwitz benj pasek and justin paul range from the serviceable to the very good city of stars and audition in particular the dance numbers are also a lot of fun especially the opener on a freeway and the duet between stone and gosling on mulholland drive in fact the latter dance number is particularly good because were not watching lifetrained dancers performing a dazzling and intricate routine instead were watching two people in character dancing because they simply have no other way of expressing how they feel at that moment the steps may be simpler though skillfully performed but the latter type of number is for me much more personal and impactful than the formerchazelles penchant for striking visuals is also on display here utilizing more potent color contrasts than were utilized in whiplash but still effectively using the shadows editing and movement to keep the viewer engaged perhaps the most remarkable sequences comes near the end in which most of the key scenes are flashed back with certain elements changed in a way that plays like a characters fleeting fantasy this scene is so well shot directed and edited that it could almost stand on its own as a short filmso why does it feel like something is missing i think the problem lies in the fact in the fact that chazelles view as a director is broader than the confines of his script while the visuals and the size of the cast are expansive seeming to take in large swaths of los angeles the script more or less limits itself exclusively to the relationship between gosling and stone although others do occasionally drift in theyre given very little to do save provide expository dialogue  eg goslings sister rosemary dewitt has one scene to establish herself as the practical one of the family to balance out her dreamer brother then effectively disappears this approach worked on a more narrow dramatic scale in whiplash  which relied upon the triangulated relationship between miles teller jk simmons and paul reiser  such a narrow character focus makes the canvas feel somewhat empty here whether that is by design is not really clear but it does make one feel that chazelle was so thrilled with the goslingstone relationship that he forgot that the people around them should have more than one dimension lest they come off more as props than charactersis this problem fatal  no is still a fun welledited choreographed and directed musical with two very good lead performances had chazelle better scaled the production to the script or viceversa however it could have been something even more remarkable,happy
ryan gosling is an aspiring jazz pianist and singer hot headed but charming sebastian and emma stone is sweet barista and aspiring actress miait gets off to a rocky start in the beginning as he has been fired from a club over not playing the right kind of music as she likes his music he ignores her rudelybut when she and he recognize one another and get past their distrust and dislike they both become good friends and then turned lovers but as their careers want success it is about staying with one another as he wants to own a jazz club and save the music and she wants also write plays and act in order to jump start her career thanks to his helpwill both of them end up happily ever after or will their success drive a wedge between thembtw both of them it is their third movie together and they still have chemistry thereas this will win tons of awards,happy
i really havent felt like this after a film in a long time was intriguing it served the moviegoer with great visuals and beautiful music pieces when it came to music and dancing the movie had some old singing in the rain charisma but it still was brought to this century emma stone and ryan gosling are always wonderful together and balanced each other well in as well their singing and dancing was cute  not perfect  but it suited their story well the movie was full of lightness sadness happiness and longing that made me personally feel like i was really part of their world afterwards i found myself walking about in the snow while humming the closing melody as it was just so catching brought romance back into the cinema and it was wonderfully refreshing im still smiling after it,happy
when i went to see i was sure i wouldnt like but as the first scene started i was amazed completely transported to a musical world of sing and dance i really think it is worth going to see going back to the first scene on the santa monica freeway for about 5 minutes were just dancing and singing i really thought that gosling and stone were perfect for the roles and if emma watson and miles teller would have been terrible in those roles the music is just incredible and the jazz is perfect go see it its amazing if you are into love and chick flicks you will love it it really shows you what life would have been like in the 1940s and as soon as i got home from the cinema i downloaded the soundtrack to listen to my 3 favourite song someone in the crowd a lovely night and city of starsit really is worth going to see xxx,happy
heres a confession i am a somewhat nostalgic person when i hear a tune by ella fitzgerald or frank sinatra i think to myself what happened to this kind of uplifting wellmade wonderful music the same goes for musicals the pure uncomplicated joy expressed by the classic hollywood musicals seems to be a thing of the past it was an expression of postwar optimism when people yearned for escapist entertainment in the cinema all they wanted to see and hear were nicesounding tunes dazzling choreographies colourful set designs and happily smiling characters later on as society changed the social dramas the war movies and the psychological thrillers made the musicals look a bit sillythe musical didnt really die but the happygolucky feeling of those classic hollywood musicals did recreating it seemed impossible until came alongthe film captures a spirit of carefree optimism that nobody expects in 2017 the title the cinematography the boymeetsgirlstory the tinseltown setting the references to classic films it all fits perfectly together in this sense is a wonderful movieon the other hand it is just that a modernday recreation of the classic hollywood musical its good really enjoyable and fun to watch but its not monumental thoughtprovoking or deeply emotional i enjoyed watching it but the hype in the media and the record number of award nominations are perhaps a bit overdone,happy
emma stones acting and graceful dancing was superb in my opinion it is a movie that kind of like those from audrey hepburns time it is for the romantic for the dreamers ryan goslings acting was okay for me about the ending it is a realistic one and well this movie portrays what really happens in real life from the hard work you put in to follow your dreams the love of your life that eventually fails and you end up marrying someone else to walking into your past and finally walking away muttering under your breath oh well fascinating movie actually transition between scenes are good very old school which is a great thing i think that emma stone is very beautiful although when she speaks she has this th sound going on distracting honestly,happy
whats aboutan aspiring actress and a struggling jazz musician fall in love and inspire each other artisticallyis it any good grade afeaturing truly dazzling filmmaking and strong performances by emma stone and ryan gosling is an enchanting blend of modern and retro taking place in presentday los angeles but made in the style of classic hollywood musicals its a delight the leads are merely passable as vocalists but strong as actors and dancers their undeniable chemistry combined with the sensibilities of writerdirector damien chazelle who places one foot in bittersweet reality and the other in whimsical fantasy make for an unforgettable cinematic experience the songs choreography wardrobe production design editing and cinematography are topshelf it could use a bit tighter pacing and the ending may divide some audiences i thought it was beautiful but this unconventional love story is a mustseeis it okay for your kidsis rated pg13 it has one fword and a few moderate profanities along with two vulgar hand gestures swimsuits and dresses reveal legs abdomens and mild cleavage frankly its no more revealing than whats shown in old gene kelly movies if you go back and rewatch them theres some drinking at hollywood parties some couples dance sensually in the background but its not raunchy or explicit a man and woman kiss and live together we see them cuddling fully clothed in bed there is no sexualityany worthwhile messagesbe grateful for the people who inspire you pursue your dreams with tenacity and integrity the direction your life takes hinges on the decisions you make choose wisely surround yourself with people who believe in you but also hold you accountable,happy
this movie shouldnt be criticized from a logical point of view and shouldnt be evaluated by a julliards singing teachers this movie is the only one that i can recall that had me leaving the theater in tears and long after the movie i felt its impact i guess it depends on the reviewers own personal story weather this movie will get a 5 or a 10 star review i was deeply struck by emotions watching and it doesnt matter weather gosling was good or bad or weather stone knows how to sing the scenes of dancing and singing are metaphoric and vivid in colors expressing their emotions which anyone whos been in a similar situation in life will understand and connect with by similar situations i mean the relationship that has its high ups and low downs and when you dont want to let go but you know have to just listen to the story,happy
went to see this movie with out seeing the trailer and knowing a little of the story line but embraced with the high critics of the crowd and the media bear in mind that this movie ties titanic record of 14 nominees including best motion picture i was expecting a romantic movie with a catching plot with heartbreaking moments and i realized this is no more that a good moviethe fact that is a musical has no particular influence in my rating there pretty good song that are worthy of being listening in the upcoming weeks and of course jonh legend performance is a valuable plusthis is a good movie but is far away from an oscar winning it lacks the emotions and deep that a movie of this gender needs to transmit do not go to the cinema expecting to see a moving love story because you will be disappointedone of the best moments in my opinion was the scene in van beek when sebs express himself about the jazz and which represent for him producing in me a kind of nostalgia and feeling makes me remember a little bit of one of my favorite movies midnight in paris a quote i will remember people love what other people are passionate about,happy
i liked this film id like hollywood to try to do more in this vein it compares well to many recent films of this genre however it really pales in comparison to the musicals of the 1930s 40s 50s and even later decades if you like this film you should really love fred astaire and ginger rogers top hat the gay divorce roberta follow the fleet swing time shall we dance carefree gene kelly singing in the rain  plus you get donald oconner and debbie reynolds judy garland easter parade for me and my gal summer stock eleanor powell born to dance broadway melody of 1938 broadway melody of 1940 howard keel show boat kiss me kate seven brides for seven brothers kismet kathryn grayson gordon macrae  shirley jones oklahoma carousel and many many others,happy
is about two people one an aspiring actor the other one a jazz enthusiast who both fall for each other and whose story gets told via the manner of a musicaldamien chazelle returns to create his second movie also musiccentered his previous film whiplash was one of the better films of 2014 in that movie he showed his talent but in this one he even surpassed his previous achievements chazelle used incredibly long beautiful shot takes often accompanied with a good song more on the songs later these scenes are seamlessly cut together whereby sometimes they make it seem that the scene was shot in one take but actually had some cleverly hidden edits in them often these were hidden behind quick camera movements the movie by the way begins in such a fashion as i just described that scene was done fantastic and set up high expectations for the rest of the film what damien chazelle also did was to use vibrant colors throughout the whole film green purple yellow red all return multiple times in the film each end everyone having a meaning to them which made the film more interestingthe songs were written with care and added to the film they each told a story that had something to do with the scene or the story and werent just useless songs there to fill up the moment or to be there and later to sell a soundtrack to double their earnings no they are there because they have a meaning the songs were beautifully written and performed and i really understand why the oscars have picked out two of the songs which i also found to be two of the best songs in the film there were of course some songs that were lesser good but even those i found to be amusing to listen to not only the songs sung by the cast were good but also the instrumentals in the background were fantastic to listen to those also added to the scenes that they were setting up i do have one problem with how some of the songs were presented but that problem mostly lies with me and not with the movie this problem is that at times it feels kind of forced how they start some songs at times they just burst out of songs which was unfitting to me but thats the nature of a musical so what did i expect but at times those scenes where handled very well i liked how the lights drained out only focusing on the one whos going to sing and at times the singing also happened naturally and didnt feel forced so its kind of a double edged swordi want to come back to the directing of damien chazelle because i want to say a couple of things on his visual directing that looked absolutely gorgeous like ive said he used vibrant colors which really made the scenes stand out more the use of vibrant colors is also something that you dont see that often anymore in films which is a shame because look at the result got the framing was good and the camera movements to were fantastic chazelle used shadow and lightning brilliantly to created goodlooking shots and he also masters the use of focus enough about that lets move on to the acting ryan gosling once again shows that he is a diverse actor and can play a whole host of characters in this movie he gives a fantastic performance and its no surprise that he has gotten that oscar nomination emma stone too gives a fantastic performance at first i was a bit skeptical with her but after the first thirty minutes or so she persuaded me into enjoying her performance the both of them had great on screen chemistry whereby their relationship only became more believable and realistic the script was very good and the characters stood out to me the most the story itself was straightforward and easy to follow nonetheless it was a good story it was realistic and grounded just like the characters and thats why i liked them so much most of the times you get to see unrealistic characters but here that wasnt the case in you can see two relatable people fighting to reach their dreams accompanied with the struggle that fight brings them because these characters are so realistic and relatable you also start to care for them what i also liked about the film is that it made me appreciate jazz more because of one particular scene in which ryan gosling is enthusiastic about it trying to convince emma stone how good jazz can be the scene was wonderfully written and in that scene he didnt only convince emma stone but also me the ending was weird at first but when i realized what was going on i started to appreciate it more and more until the movie ended with it satisfying yet heartbreaking conclusion the film really plays with your emotions and can make you feel sad and happy again in a spit second but at the end it all felt like a feelgood movie created for people who have dreams and have trouble reaching them what i very much appreciatedwas a very good musical and this comes from someone who generally doesnt like musicals the songs were good and so was the acting damien chazelle created one of the most well directed films of the year and thats why i am giving this one a 9210,happy
damien chazelle is very talented the bouquets he is getting for this film ought to have come instead for his previous work whiplash a far superior work will appeal to those who have worked hard to achieve their dreams whiplash was more complex with darkness and light chazelles forte utilized to the hilt in it was replaced by lush color often helped by the clothes wornits mushythe actors look good always the music appeals to you but is it all that great no this is mere escapism whiplash on the other hand was real and deserved better,happy
i am not a lover of musicals i have seen and studied the origins of film musicals so perhaps it is more accurate for me to say that i do not enjoy the cheesy utopian tone which many musicals tend to adopt was spectacular and fought off any potential cheesiness with showing the reality behind the hollywood dream it did begin with a musical number which i thoroughly enjoyed and i believed that the characters breaking into song was so cohesive because it was written into the narrative in such a naturalistic way emma stones performance was thrilling she is an actress of amazing talent and i believe she far outshined ryan goslings performance in this film perhaps he acts better when he is in slower moving and more emotional films the choreography and cinematography worked hand in hand and i thoroughly enjoyed this fresh breath of air in the film musical genre congratulations to the director for pulling this off i cant imagine it was easy to pitch a musical given the current successful films,happy
finally i got to watched  the oscar champ who garnered 14 nominations and my life will never be the same it took me to the journey that has been long forgotten in hollywood something that was magical out of this world i do hope that wins all 14 oscars  it really deserve it so much i was at a loss for adjectives or fancy lines to define this film so i simply put the line i loved from the trailer starting from the best part is the music of the best the movie is one of those old time musical where everyone dances and sings such beautiful songs its purely timeless experience i never expected it would hit me so deeply in the heart but its really really great its something my heart would never allow me to forget and if i forget it i am a rocksongs like someone in the crowd  city of stars  auditionthe fools who dream and the final number  these are beyond expectations to what i had expected damien chazelles direction is way too perfect and screenplay is among the best in decades i really wan thank him for giving such beautiful moviei dont think i will ever watch such beautiful movie like this everi was literally in another world and all those numbers are so so so exciting the whole score  cinematography and stage production along with best performances of career by ryan gosling and emma stone makes this movie not only the masterpiece or the best but it sits as the very top this is a classic especially the last number which is dreamy sequence and throws light on what is dream and what is real the set and the story paired with each great musical number and a few heartbreaks that showcase the harsh life of showbusiness is here to break it into small parts  the movie begins with a vast musical number heavily choreographed on a highway dancing on top of cars and the lyrics resonates to the whole story and also provide our first glimpse to our aspiring actress and rising pianist then begins the theme for both the characters  the story follows another great musical number someone in the crowd whose mid tempo tune especially during the middle and last part composing of flute is very good and mia asks herself does she wana meet that someone and what it will be likethe two characters met with some funny scenes and also whats going on in their lives is shownthey met again not accepting there is something between them in waste of a lovely night which is also very nicely choreographed and especially the cinematography during all these numbers is breath taking  its like every frame of this movie can be my wall poster then there is the very best city of stars which also has a duet in later part of film the most magicl moment of the film is when shadows of our charcetrs are shwon dancing in circles against the background of planeterium which is very nice sebastian changes his dream a little bit so that he can get is own club mia writes and performs her own play only to witness few people showing upfor it and not even seb as they had a fight earlier seb did come but mia states her drems are over  that scene is really well portrayed by mia but mia later gets a call for audition and seb manages to convince her to do it and she did it they confess they will love each other forever auditionthe fools who dream is the song which shows the feelings of mia and other people who dreams but are considered fools its a powerful song and emma stones defining moment probably best of her career fast forward to 5 years mia is a famous actress  married and have a lovely daughter and seb has his own club mia and her husband comes into sebs club and then begins the epic eplogue which in my opinion is the defining moment of the film its a medly of all the musical numbers with only music and no lyrics and showcases the scenario if mia and seb would have been togetherthis nearly 8 minute long sequence is what dreams are made up of but as it ends harsh reality comeswhat happens in movies  doesnt happen in real life mia leaves with both she and seb smiling to each other as the film ends with humming to city of starseach musical number is carefully crafted with such deliverence its just soaring and dazzling finally watch it in cinema you may never get other chance like this its beautiful  soaring  marvelous  enchanting  magical  masterpiece and every other good adjective present in the dictionary,happy
to me it was sold as a musical but it was actually a movie with music in it it indeed had a lot of performed songs and it had the jazz but thats not what a musical is supposed to be not at alla musical is supposed to tell the story through the music itself and in the music itself didnt tell the story which is what a musical does it tells the story through the musici acknowledge that its a great movie but i felt cheated and it disappointed me because i wanted to watch a musical in the likes of chicago dreamgirls and hairsprayi wanted to watch a movie that used the music as the means to tell the story,happy
during the year i go on average 20 times to the movies and i leave a happy i0 an accomplished 5 and i enchanted but in love i never go out well everything has a first time behold the story of sebastian ryan gosling who is a musician who dreams of reclaiming the soul of jazz and opening his own club and mia emma stone who is a diner clerk who dreams of becoming a successful actress historia may be simple and clich its the kind of things were already tired of seeing in the movies but weve never seen it that way you can believe its been many years since weve seen something with such flawless direction when la land it starts simple its usually simple but at one point it completely flushes out of the clich comes to life drives enchants and surprises and not in the most dangerous of moments  the ending  it disappoints its conclusion is perfect beautiful and memorable it is very clich to make a movie about love novelty is always the way to treat this love and here we see something completely different we have a message that goes against all the standard of hollywood we have a moral where it says love is not always above everything we can give it up to pursue our dreams but that does not mean that we will stop loving for even renegade impossible and depreciated love never dies with time technically la land is perfect it would be a complete exaggeration to say that it is the best photograph of the cinema but it was the best i saw on the cinema screen its lighting is out of series the way light is thrown from one side to symbolize loneliness love anger and fear even to highlight the unique moment of a character or to reflect the green of hope in emma stones face in the dining room we can understand the whole movie only by its lighting all its counterplanes are brilliant and all the scenes in sequences plans  they are not few  they are perfect and completely enthralling worth a highlight for the first scene of the movie after watching this scene you will make a point of paying another ticket ill leave here my thanks to the cinematographer of this film linus sandgren ryan gosling and emma stone are completely out of character given to roles and with an impressive chemistry the couple loves everyone not only with their dances and kisses but in their ways of looking behaving mania and malice was very well deserved his nominations to oscar and damien chazelle is already next to denis villeneuve as the names of the new generation of directors even try only 3 movies in his cinematography damien surprises and shocks everyone again before with whiplash now with his films are exciting dark cheerful and simply sensational is worth it its a different musical from everything youve ever seen even if you do not like the genre please take a chance after all competing in i3 oscar categories its not for anyone,happy
it was a dark monday night in january and so i went to the movies this is the film of the moment so i went to try it without too much idea of what i might see i saw it described as a musical i wouldnt call it that  its a romance with some music and dancing in it and a little touch of fantasy the two leads were unknown to me so i was coming to them fresh i liked ryan gosling he played his character cool and understated  just right i thought as for emma stone what can i say about this young lady she is not conventionally beautiful but she has what i would call an interesting face every emotion she feels registers on her face and in her lovely eyes she comes across as elegant and stylish  she had me hooked on her from the start she wants to be a movie actress and he wants to own his own jazz club it is a struggle but they both make it in the end what makes this film great is that five years later she comes back with her husband and little child a conventional romance would have seen them finish with each other but this film has the courage to show that you dont necessarily end up with someone you love that is true in real life she and her husband see sebastien in his jazz club and the memory is triggered they both wonder how things would have gone if they had married each other when i got home i was in bed quite a while before i slept even after i slept i dreamt in my dreams i saw scenes from the film and i also saw the face of the girl i loved 20 years ago i dont know where she is now but she helped make my life better there are people you never forget so to everyone who made this film  the director the screenwriter the cinematographer the composer and above all the two stars i say thank you this is why i love music and dancing and films this film touched my heart because it reminded me of the happiest time in my own life this is why the arts are an essential part of human life will it do well at the oscars ill be very surprised if it doesnt,happy
i cant remember the last time i fell in love with a movie head over heels before this oh yes i do it was whiplash theres gotta be a pattern there somewhere and there is of course the magical duo damien chazelle and justin hurwitz have done it again delivering another cinematic masterpiece in the form of the conflict of hard headed careerism and heartfelt romanticism in hollywood a town that manufactures fairy tales for adults is at the core ofand is unflinchingly examinedat first glance before i heard about the universal acclaim the movie was garnering i thought the title looked corny and upon finally getting the ticket and witnessing the beginning scene the skeptic in me reared its ugly head the dance number on the freeway didnt quite appease me even though the song was catchy it was clichd and unremarkable looking like one of those annoying random flash mobs you get in every city how mislead i was indeed shortly afterwards the title rolled on and theres ryan goslingsebastian waiting in the traffic in his classic crimson open rooftop ride twiddling the radio playing jazz as the camera panned forwards to the prius in which emma stonemia was rehearsing her lines among the many cars on the gridlocked highway the cars start moving and emma didnt follow suit distracted by her audition lines prompting angry honks and wtf looks from ryan which emma replies by flashing a birdie and immediately i knew i was in for a treat from then on what followed was a montage  showing how mia a barista in a coffee shop strives to become a successful actress amidst all her disappointing auditions and sebastian who harbors a hope to revive the dying jazz by opening his own club albeit betraying his passion by going on gigs he hates just to pay his rent and how their paths cross albeit accidentally but amusing and where it all goes from there  so beautiful and mesmerizing i couldnt help but watch in awe every part of my body quite frequently tingling with goosebumps with lines uttered or just plain silence and music played each and every scene was magnificent flowing from one frame to another in a manner both effortless and tailor made for each other such was the beauty of the script penned and lived out to perfection by the leads ryan was brooding and sardonic and limited somewhat but he was effective in his own ways conveying emotions be it snappy annoyance at someone poking fun at jazz despair at being misunderstood or unbridled love and joy without so much as a word uttered but brisk expressions and body language emma stone however was simply delightful she waltzed in and out of every frame she featured in charmingly expressive with her wide range of emotions and heart failing smiles and eyes that stare and wink at the soul their dance numbers and duets together were authentic and charming which makes them one of the few pairs in hollywood with sizzling chemistry the tap dance bit on the bridge overlooking the picturesque glittering city of la bathed in purplish orange twilight especially quaintof course for a musical the music is what makes or breaks a movie and here it ticks all the boxes right from the tap dance number a lovely night to the hauntingly melancholic mia and sebs theme simply a treat for the ears as well as the eyes thanks to the limited yet intimate dance choreography and of course the camera work the palette of colours on show was quite dazzling first popping like fireworks and then subdued and luminescent as los angeles is in its full element here displayed in all its glory the spellbinding sequence entitled planetarium could be mistaken for heaven itself while baby boomers would note that the dancing and singing of ryan and emma could scarcely be compared to that of singin in the rain for instance for me it felt real sincere and modest but no less lovely which crucially added credence to the storyhowever what makes this movie truly spectacular is the execution and directing theres not a single scene that was out of place and not a single dialogue that seemed irrelevant in the same mould of whiplashdelivers where it really counts the storytelling the placement of the musical segments is controlled and ordered giving its way to the development of the story effectively the theme of the film is compelling and relevant to people of all age in modern day  whether you are young with enthusiasm and dreams for tomorrow or old with tender nostalgia of the yesteryears not only was it fresh but it unabashedly evokes our emotions in a way that either makes us grin from ear to ear or hits us hard in our guts and leaves a lasting tinge of sadness look me straight in the eyes and tell me that symphony of an ending didnt leave a lump in your throat while the climax of whiplash was thrilling and pulsatings was delicate but powerful nonetheless pulling curtains over the movie in way youd never see coming putting you under its spell which wistfully stays with you long after youve left the theater and driving back home humming the city of starsa gem that will live on and called back to for generations to come is neither over the top fantasy or gritty harsh reality its more about where the line is between the two and how it defines love and this is where the movie trumps above all others showing us both what we want to see and what we tend to avoid or ignore cant recommend this enough so go on now and get yourselves lost in this bittersweet tale of passion and pragmatism 1010,happy

with a soundtrack composed of marvelous contemporary jazz tunes along with traditional classics of the genre as well as a few familiar 1980s songs to boot terrific acting singing and dancing performances is not only one of the best films of 2016 but is the leading contender for a sack full of academy awards and an experience that will no doubt leave one with a tear in their eye and a giddy silly smile after its all overwritten and directed by damien chazelle 10 cloverfield lane whiplash the movie hearkens back to the days of the big bold extravagant hollywood musicals by busby berkeley ginger rogers and fred astaire and others but adds enough of a modern touch with a sweet love story and extremely attractive leads ryan gosling and emma stone that even jaded 21st century audiences will stand and cheer at its conclusion no stranger to the musical format having directed both whiplash and guy and madeline on a park bench and a jazz percussionist himself chazelle captures the mood perfectly as sebastian gosling the big short the nice guys is a downonhisluck pianist who loves free jazz even at the expense of a paying gig tinkling out christmas tunes and mia stone birdman battle of the sexes a putupon starbucks employee and aspiring actress who meet notsocute in stifling los angeles traffic since they are immediately repelled and repulsed by one another we know of course they will eventually fall in love after going through growing pains in their relationship she has to drop a decent but boring beau finn wittrock the big short in the process while his as awkward as a middle schooler on his first datelater sebastian who dreams of owning his own nightclub is invited to join a contemporary jazz combo messenger fronted by pop musician john legend while mia writes her own onewoman play based upon her childhood in arizona where stone was actually bornthe stress of these divergent careers he is always on the road she pines for him but has her own life to lead however takes its toll on the love affair and soon becomes the conflict that sets up the third act will sebastian become a success and get his own establishment will mia make it big as an actress well the viewer will just have to see for themselves but for this scribbler was a wonderfully exhilarating homage to the golden age of hollywood but one which does not gloss over the seedier side of the city as well a realistic look at what it takes to put everything on the line for a shot at a few minutes in the spotlight some of the more amazing sequences include the rousing opening number another day in the sun in which dozens of singers and dancers stop la traffic  literally mia puts her heart into her auditions only to have them interrupted or cut short losing their effectiveness sebastian and mia dance through space at the griffith park observatory he plays to a sellout crowd as a member of legends bland but successful band and a beautiful concluding montage which shows how different things could have been or does it show how things really were hmmm gosling who earned an oscar nomination for 2006s halfnelson is sweet and engaging here as the passionate pianist who is obsessed with the traditional performers so much so that he ignored the musical genres future potential with a whole new generation of fans he won the golden globe for best actor in a musicalcomedy and is a lock for a second academy award nomination meanwhile i dare say that stone whose turn as the selfdestructive daughter in birdman a few years ago earned her first oscar nod was never better and has a golden globe herself to prove it with large blue eyes flashing with both inner joy and heartaching pathos it would be a major crime if she is also not recognized by the academy good supporting work is added by legend tom everett scott that thing you do and jk simmons oscar winner for whiplash but this enterprise belongs to gosling and stone almost 100 percent and their argument scene is one of the more emotional moments of any film this yearwith fun thoughtful and clever tunes including city of stars someone in the crowd a lovely night start a fire and audition the fools who dream among others terrific design detail david wasco a quentin tarantino favorite and stunning cinematography by linus sandgren joy american hustle is a dazzling dizzying exhilarating experience and would seemingly be the picture to beat unless the academy wants to send a diversity message and choose moonlight or vote for the heavily dramatic manchester by the seaif i had a ballot though i might just choose this film to become the first musical since chicago in 2002 to claim the best picture statuette but then again no one has yet extended that privilege to me so i will just have to dream wont i grade a,happy
this movie has stolen my heart i went into this movie with high expectations and it soared above them thank you damien chazelle for a movie that can be savored over and over thank you justin hurwitz for a brilliant score that has stayed with me and replayed endlessly in my mind thank you ryan gosling and emma stone for being such a great screen couple especially in the musical numbers from the first frame to the one that says the end i was hooked by this tale of romance filled with one of the most infectious soundtracks i have ever heard not since titanic have i cried so much in a movie the movie is cleverly edited and a whatmighthavebeen sequence towards the end is just dazzling to behold i boldly predict that this movie with its timeless theme will remain fresh for many generations to come and become a staple for cultists everywhere,happy
ive always assumed that referring to los angeles as was a put down a pejorative description of the city as the home of illusion and fantasy damian chazelle in his film titled however sees it as the home of a different sort of makebelieve  an enchanting joyfilled arena where singing and dancing about life is as authentic as living it here los angeles plays itself with a mixture of fantasy and reality and a nod to films such as jacques demys musicals of the french new wave the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort reinventing the genre for a new generation offers a delightful combo of jazz pop songs dance routines and two people in love dreaming under the stars its enough to make you think that our current political scene may only reflect temporary insanityin the film sebastian ryan gosling an aspiring jazz pianist and mia emma stone a promising actress come to hollywood to fulfill their dreams but find that dreamers are not always in vogue the now wellknown opening scene is shot on the la freeway but those who drive it every day probably wouldnt have noticed much difference in the volume of noise walltowall cars and people acting out here though the acting out is  really acting though the commuters seem as agitated as always the fake traffic jam however is much more entertaining than the real one as a chorus bursts out with the song another day of sun written by justin hurwitz with lyrics by benj pasek and justin paul and you forget that you will be very late for workthe story itself is bittersweet though it always has an air of innocence mia works behind the counter at the warner brothers studio lot but still makes time for auditions that may only last thirty seconds or less seb dreams of owning his own jazz club but is forced to play christmas music at a lounge by his boss jk simmons a little less overbearing than in whiplash but still ornery enough to fire him when he stops playing jingle bells mia wants to meet the fired pianist after his doomed gig but he rudely brushes right past her  no meet cute there of course we all know they are going to be a couple eventually and when they do come together romantically they are a charming pair who exude chemistry as they make their way through some of los angeles notable tourist attractions such as griffith park observatory where they fly halfway to the starsthough gosling and stone are no ginger rodgers and fred astaire they are good enough to elevate our spirits as they sing and dance to the strains of songs such as city of stars a tune that you may even remember after you go home although she is not a big fan of jazz mia and seb do have a love of music in common but their relationship becomes complicated when he joins a band led by john legend and commits himself to going on tour mia has put her hopes in performing a onewoman play but it fails to attract an audience and she is back to square one nonetheless works hard from beginning to end to make its point that if you stick to your guns work hard enough and dont give up things will eventually work out that however may be its most gravitydefying trick of all,happy
everyone loved this movie so i got ready to hate it to find any possible mistake in order to rip its heart out and feel more intelligent than anyone else i tried hard really but when mia experienced her catharsis listening to the background jazz music during the dinner with greg i experienced my own i knew i was going to lovethis city of stars has the feeling of the hollywood golden age but at the same time has its own personality emma stone and ryan gosling are stunning and in some ways i felt like i was watching a classic shirley maclaine and jack lemmon love story,happy
music and movies seem to go hand in hand and lately thats been obvious the last few years have opened the door to many great music related films amy miles ahead straight outta compton love  mercy etc but you know what hasnt been popular musicals what was once the most popular genre in cinema rarely enters the public consciousness today the last major musical release excluding disney cartoons was les miserables and that still polarizes audiences to this day and then this film came out feels like it was tailor made for me a classic hollywood musical with traditional sets big choreographed numbers bright colors and throw in some love of davisera jazz it feels like a dream thankfully the film didnt let me down i enjoyed every minute of it i loved the homages to classic golden age films like rebel without a cause and singin in the rain and stone and gosling were a delight to watch my one issue would have to be that i feel like they didnt use certain scenes to their full potential the observatory space dance and goslings number on the pier couldve gone on a bit longer the space dance couldve been grand and beautiful but it instead felt very short and made me wanting more still its hard not to praise a film like this it was beautiful fun and an all around great experience,happy
is likely to go down in history for being one of the most memorable films of this generation it somehow finds a way to perfectly balance oldtimey themes which are hard to incorporate without seeming too clich with modern elements and did so without one single hiccup the music and visuals are absolutely breathtaking dont be surprised if you find yourself keeping each and every song on a never ending repeat during the days following your spectacular movie experience is guaranteed to make you feel almost every emotion possible throughout the film whether it be happiness nostalgia contentedness sadness or if youre like me all at the same time for those of you about to watch this one youre in for a real treat you wont see another one like this for a very long time,happy
this movie puzzles i watched it two days ago and im still a bit confused there is no doubt it is well done it touches you the last scene is amazing and brings a tear to the eye it also full of interesting commentary on life like when gosslings bandmate asks him how can you be a revolutionist if youre such a traditionalist theres amazing freshness that the director brings to the screen  for example the long car horn flashback and its subsequent use throughout the film but theres no denying the film has issues that  depending on what youre expecting  will affect the way you see it 1 is it too long or too slow it could be the firstkiss scene for example seems to be an endless impossible build up but the question is  is the kiss really important if you dont care about rushing to anywhere maybe you can just enjoy the long dance and talk and fantasy that precedes it and thats true for the whole film 2 is it full of clichs yes it is you will enter the realm of kitsch but hey  its a musical for heavens sake and its even called so why should you expect anything else there is no effort to avoid clichs or kitsch  on the contrary they are sought after and elevated this movie is an ode to innocence to the old naive cinema the characters are not complicated  they have simple drives the narrative isnt complicated an important evening the other promises to be there but heshe forgot that they have other engagement etc  a pure and clich expression of the conflict between love and life it sells you the big dreams of being an artist and not selling out of romantic love that transcend time but so what these are universal themes that we all should be reminded of sometimes even if they are farfarfar from our realist and complicated life 3 theres also the tiny con that the actors didnt always hit the note too well but its not too bad or noticeable i think if you will take all this into consideration you will enjoy this movie tremendously but even if you dont  its still a good fun movie that is definitely worth seeing,happy
i regard myself as a musical sceptic i have never understood the old school hollywood musicals in the wonderful opening sequence on the jammed highway i first thought that i am really going to hate thisno no no please stay inside the cars like the normal people and then magic the movie totally won me over to be honest there were slow moments and the quick changes between styles got me a bit confused in the beginning i had time to think that maybe they should have hired justin timberlake because he can sing and dance and why ryan goslings hair is greasy but dont worry ryan gosling is perfect for the role in the end you will agree i loved the careful details such as the huge poster of ingrid bergman and the references to casablanca the greatest and saddest love story of all time music score was absolutely great what makes this movie greater than a basic feel good movie is that the love story and the main characters development and ambitions are more important than their immediate feelings young people were happy and laughing when the movie ended whereas i cried melancholic but sweet tears this was a beautiful and surprising movie that had one of the greatest endings since casablanca i warmly recommend the movie for all movie lovers including notorious musical sceptics,happy
please note i do not think there are any spoilers in this review however i dont think it is worth the risk of having the review taken down i had been thinking about joining this site for some time now but never really found time to this is my first ever review on the sight and i would like to make it known i am an avid film buff the main reason i joined was because of all the negative reactions to this film  to the point where its rating dropped from an 88 average down to an 87 average this bothered me a lot because this in my opinion is the greatest film to come out so far in the decade and is now one of my favourite films of all time and i would like my voice to be heard on the matter so here it goesthis movie marks the directors third feature length film after guy and madeline on a park bench 2009 and a personal favourite of mine whiplash 2014 chazelles newest film however is without a doubt his masterpiece as noted from when i watched whiplash for the first time in collage chazelle is a master with the use of his camera and is able to make every single shot meaningful and artistically stimulating this film however takes this skill to a whole new level as his use of long takes to show off his actors skills is utter perfection the dance routines in this film are well choreographed and must have taken many rehearsal hours to get on point this hard work pays off purely through the extended length of each take  however there are certainly moments that seem to try and trick you into thinking a sequence is done in one take when in reality they cut as the camera is spinning reminiscent of 2014s birdman the greatest aspect of this film is the closing sequence which reflects on all the events leading up to this point of the story and it done in a manner that is so movingly artistic it almost brought a tear to my eye a feat that is never accomplished with me chazelle experiments with many forms of visual storytelling without the use of voice in this sequence that for a general audience who do not pick up on stylistic choice it may become daunting to some or boring to others as in the case of whiplash the story is incredibly focused on the two leads with the side plots being left as just that  to the side in this film ryan gosling and emma stone play the lovable pair of sebastian and mia who both aspire for greatness in their industries sebastian has a passionate flair for jazz music reflecting on chazelles view on the genre as all three movie have been heavily focused on the dying of that industry and mia is a talented actress who just cannot seem to land a roll no matter how hard she tries the film relishes the beauty of these aspirations and has a message for artists everywhere that she should always follow their dreams no matter how hard it may seem or how often you are set back  which is again reflected on chazelles own experience as a low budget film maker to now accomplishing his dream and now working in the big leagues of the industry but i digress the chemistry between these two is so believable through the writing and acting that it no longer feels as though you are watching a film and more as if you are peering into the struggling lives of two very real people and you feel compelled to follow their story to the very end this film is not just a romance however it is also a musical and a musical is nothing without a good soundtrack that relates back to the story or the raw emotions the characters are feeling at the time this film is the best written musical i have ever seen the songs tone and pace is very reminiscent of that of the musical decade of the 1950s only unlike those movies this one is heavily grounded in the harshness of reality and forces you to confront the most realistic scenarios that these character would go through in the real world this film is visually fascinating musically pleasing and heartwrenchingly grounded in reality  creating a very dream like state where both everything and nothing feels real this one i will be buying on blu ray and will be rewatching time and time again,happy
i saw this for my 15th birthday and its great from the opening cinemascope card to the very last frame sebastian ryan gosling is a man who wants to start a jazz club to enliven the genre and mia the always talented emma stone is an aspiring actress who is also a waitress naturally these two meet and the film follows them and their ups and downs i hate giving away spoilers so i wontthe soundtrack to this film is very catchy the opening scene alone is a musical number in a traffic jam and i reckon if your kid is mature enough to understand the film there is very little inappropriate content but the pg13 rating in the us is because ryan gosling says an f word once and theres a little bit of bad language and the chemistry between ryan and emma just feels very natural the film is a hybrid of a musical and a serious romantic drama and the singing from these actors is pretty good the dancing more so but when it needs to be emotional it is when it needs to be funny it is there is just a magical quality to this that i cant describeif theres one thing i can nitpick its that the film can sometimes be a little slow but thats nitpicking seriously see this when you can you will not regret itvideo review link for this and the edge of seventeen httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6hfnx7b4khqt50sdrak entertainment channel link httpswwwyoutubecomchanneluclpgkpd7g2fjf2i2pk8okmw,happy
are you a rusher or are you a dragger writer director damien chazelle had us all asking this question after he released the spectacular movie that is whiplash now off the back of an amazing directorial debut and having just co wrote one of the best films of 2016 10 cloverfield lane chazelle is back with his second film and boy is he back is a beautiful film about falling in love and chasing a dream but is also about the difficulties that come with bothchazelle blows us away with the films opening scene the opening highway gridlock number is perfectly directed by chazelle singing dancing cycling parkour its all there and is all seamlessly choreographed by mandy moore in a scene that is shot as if done in one take i am not certain if it is the scene perfectly sets the tone for the films first act which is that of a sophisticated homage to hollywoods golden age of entertainmentthe first act introduces us to our two protagonists and their dreams mia is a woman trying to make it as an actress in hollywood and is played wonderfully by emma stone and sebastian is a struggling musician aspiring to resurrect jazz music and is played phenomenally by ryan gosling the two leads work fantastically well together and their on screen chemistry is the best ive seen since her personally i got behind sebastian and his dream more than i did with mia and i believe that is chazelles intention as evident in the films ending but ill come back to that later sebastians dream was a small thing and is achievable and realistic paired with goslings passionate performance i really felt his love for the music and so was drawn to him the reason i didnt connect with mia was because her dream is clich although her reason behind it is one that i understood its still a very vague and clich dream and so i did not connect with mia but as i said this is chazelles aim and due to this the films ending is so much more emotionalafter the film pays tribute to hollywoods golden age and establishes our characters their relationship and their dreams the second act brings us back down to a more sober reality now that we have come attached to these characters we experience the roller coaster ride that is their relationship and their dream chasing its up and its down its hopeful and its hopeless its heartfelt and heartbreaking what was once a tale of optimism now begins to question itself the characters question themselves and the dream and relationship conflict each other the stand out scene has to be the dinner table argument a well written and acted scene that has been built up to rather subliminally by chazelle for example i read sebastian playing piano on the left side of the stage from our perspective as him not enjoying the music hes playingthe third act brings back some of that nostalgic hope from the first act before building to its bitter sweet ending after endorsing in these characters hopes dreams and relationship we now wait eagerly to know how it ends for seb and mia chazelle both writes and directs possibly the most perfect ending for the film imaginable the how it could have been sequence is mesmerizingly saddening as classic hollywood set pieces and dance numbers reemerged all the while we are feeling sebastians regret and with my connection to him this makes the sequence all the more emotional when they exchange that one final lookoverall is beautiful homage to the golden age of hollywood the then fittingly becomes a sobering reality until building to its perfectly bittersweet ending wonderfully acted by stone and gosling and fantastically written and directed by damien chazelle mandy moore should also be praised for the films choreography and justin hurwitz for his beautiful score that ironically seems to have achieved what sebastian wanted is a near faultless movie that is personally a close second to whiplash but is likely to grant chazelle what he deserves and that is the oscar gold,happy
from the national anthem to the musical everything seemed pretty new to me starting with a song it brings so much liveliness to what is being shown it starts with a lot of vehicles stuck in traffic a woman steps out of her car and starts dancing to the song playing in her car the old vintage title card appeared it was so chillingsummer the camera slowly moves into a car where we see a girl and there is loud honking even the honking seems of a character the loud oldfashioned plymouth horns a young handsome man seated in a majestic old fashioned car is in a hurry he ratruns through the space near the girls car at which shes not very pleased she has one hand holding the phone she is talking into and gives the middle finger of the other hand to the young man which he didnt mind little did they know that they would meetthe movie follows the lives of mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling mia an aspiring actress works as a barista in a small coffee place in la hollywood and manages to go for auditions as well sebastian is a jazz musician in town who struggles too their characters are bipolar their struggles being the only uniting factorevery object in the movie plays a character by itself for instance mias house her house is no normal housebeing decorated with posters of classics like casablanca showing her interest for classics her dressing is similar  colorfulvibrant and over the top  to her house the dressing mirror reflects herself and her character toosebastian is annoyed he feels that people dont understand what jazz music conveys and that they dont discern the fact that jazz music is dyingemma stone tries to make into hollywood by making it to every acting audition possible she is a really good actor but is humiliated every time it makes us pity her when the casting officials order sandwiches while she acts and when shes done the director tells her oh were fine rejectedautumn mia is at a pool party with her friends we get to know the characters of the movie pretty well linus sandgren handles lights to perfection the camera shots are amazing the first person camera follow the people diving into the pool which is awesome to watch the way this long movie is cut the pencil sharp cuts here and there is beautiful the production design and the artwork in the movie is so intimate to the feelings the movie is intentionally made to look like a dreamy fairy tale type romance which takes place in los angeles they are both artists and naturally are dreamersdamien chazelle is the magician who made every frame of his poetry glimmer so high up in the stars the music in the movie is so pleasing and city of stars was especially brilliant the orchestra was so beautifully set the movie emanates the feelings of the characters through music  the film is so perfectly staged when mia and sebastian talk or dancewhich seemed like the same sometimesthe camera travels with themmostly one shot and creates so much fluidity the lighting changes all by itself according to their senses ah this is lovethe way the scenes at griffith observatory was shot is simply a miracle with the music their dance and how the place is so unconsciously lit with a sense of craving love which is endless and how the galaxy adds poetic metaphors to create on spell bounding inference to how movies are being shot they dont make movies like this anymore is what could be thrived upon but in the endthings need to go the way a dream does they need to wake up  get ready for work and there might be not much love if you choose to wake up  thats reality though they both wake upreality is likely to be different to the la la in the landrishi,happy

so to start i was really excited to watch this movie the opening traffic jam scene is probably the best ive seen all year as a matter of fact this was the best movie ive seen all year but ill get into that a little laterthe film is directed by damien chazelle this is his second feature film first being whiplash if you havent seen whiplash go watch it right now whiplash does have some similarities to some key points being the idea of jazz music and the story unfolding over the seasons i really cant wait to see what this director can bring us next just with these two masterpiece films i think that damien chazelle is a director to watch in the coming yearsgoodthe movie is a great balance of music comedy and drama i found myself waiting for the songs to be slowly introduced but they always came at a surprise i really liked how this films musical aspect was always a surprise i actually never could tell when a song was coming and i think this is something that makes this musical stand apart from other musicalsi knew i was going to like this film just from the intro scene that is the best depiction of la life being stuck in traffic on the freeway so smart in relating to everyone here the intense choreography that was done on the freeway was insane also im not sure but im pretty sure they shot that on the 405 south exit to the 105 eastbeing someone who grew up in los angeles this film is seriously one of the best la films ive seen we get to see some of the best los angeles architecture you also see the lighthouse which is not a jazz club no more more of a hiphop electronic dj kinda place hermosa beach along with the pier from the streets of downtown to the griffith observatory so much detail can be found in this film im honestly sad that i didnt have a chance to see this movie twice i feel like there is so much to appreciate from the choreography to the cinematography when showing la in different view points like being a coffee barista in a warner bros movie backlot shows the ambition and aspiration building in these talented artists i think that this film choosing la was carefully planned out and is the base point for the whole film in other words with la they have a very successful metaphorical filmi like how the film was heavily influenced by old school type musicals and theater but had a modern spin on the drama for example they displayed this by showing things like the toyota prius reference showing that everyone drives a prius in the modern times or when they are having the 80s pool party in a house in the hollywood hills its a classic la scenario done in a modern time even the tap dancing shows the creativity behind the modern connectionbadok now for the bad the one thing that i didnt agree with was the misconception of hollywood entertainment i love la and almost everything about it i understand that the film and art industries are really hard to become successful in i can understand how people can be offended about the whole waiting in line for your chance ideology although i dont like to see these things portrayed in hollywoods films i understand that honestly that is what la is about i think the realism of becoming an actress or a jazz musician is almost impossible in la and for this film a little too dreamy,happy

is a hopeful tale filled with catchy tunes and endearing characters mia and sebastian are two halves of the same whole and youll find yourself desiring for the two protagonists to end up together however their dreams are just as influential as their emotions and mia and sebastians careers may tear them apart into oblivion my associate biph i am mickfleigh is in love with this tale and i dont doubt that you will be too biph and i went to go see this movie two times and are aiming for a third you should try and go see it as much as us this is an amazing movie and even if you dont like musicals you would like this story too it has just enough musicand just little enough to where those who love musicals and those who hate them would both enjoy this movie ryan gosling was the perfect actor for sebastian we are in love with him and the soundtrack 1010 would recommend,happy
   is probably the best tagline for this casablanca remake minus the war but plus a lot more singing answers the question what if sam were a white dude and smoke never got in his eyes and he had a fling with ilsa before she met victor and rick would they have lived happily ever after spoiler alert the answer is no some things are just not to be for those of us who plodded through director ken burns oneman jackie robinson show aka baseball and lacked the patience to give his 42 followup jazz a listen doubtless is a more moving homage to the pride of new orleans and probably about 60 hours shorter to boot its also the 21st centurys top tribute to the attractions of 1900s hollywood especially the fred astaireginger rogers flicks one can only hope that ryan gosling is reteamed enough times with emma stone that they stumble across a gin joint in which gosling actually gets the girl,happy
every once in a while a movie comes along that injects a new life into a dying genre and changes everything whenever the film industry ran out of ideas or continued churning the same formulaic stuff for far too long there always emerged a fresh of filmmakers who took it upon themselves to bring the necessary change and in the process heralded a new era of motion pictures2016 will no doubt go down as the year in which horror reigned supreme after ages but one also cant forget the dream of an upncoming filmmaker who wished to make an original contemporary musical and made it happen with such effectiveness that it ultimately resurrected a genre that had long been dismissed as part of a bygone era the dreamers name is damien chazelle and his now realised dream is his latest filmset in los angeles the story of follows the lives of an aspiring actress who works as a barista between auditions and a jazz pianist who manages to scrape by playing in small gigs a few encounters between the two result in them falling in love with each other but when success begins to mount in their professional endeavours the dreams they have managed to keep alive in each other all this time through love  mutual support begins to fall apart  threaten their relationshipwritten  directed by damien chazelle opens with a richly coloured  gorgeously choreographed song shot entirely in a single unbroken take and then follows it up by introducing our protagonists to both the viewers  each other chazelles kinetic direction retains all the zest  passion that was evident in his last feature but also exhibits more confidence in his own abilities as a storyteller and what he has skilfully crafted here is something thats as nostalgic as it is newthe screenplay is no slouch either for the narrative follows a seasonal pattern starting with winter that focuses on the professional stasis of our characters and takes it from there as we see their relationship blossom as the story progresses until the harsh realities of life take over unlike whiplash is much calmer and more willing to celebrate the lovely moments as they come along although beneath the surface both films do share similarities in themes  characterisationthe technical aspects are expertly executed and only assist in improving  enhancing the overall experience production design team successfully impart a nostalgic feel to contemporary locations of los angeles cinematography makes ingenious use of camera as numerous segments  musical numbers are filmed in one continuous take with constant adjustment of lighting  set pieces in the background editing unfolds its 128 minutes storyline at an apt pace opting for montages at times while letting the plot simmer when the occasion calls for itsoundtrack becomes all the more essential in a musical but justin hurwitz more than lives up to the challenge of composing both the score  songs that are as memorable  catchy as they are relevant to the plot every musical number only assists in developing the characters arcs all the songs  dance segments radiate an immense sense of joy  an intoxicating feeling that is further uplifted by its firstrate choreography  exquisite photography plus it features so many instant classic moments that its really difficult to choose a favouritecoming to the performances features a perfect lead in ryan gosling  emma stone with john legend rosemarie dewitt  jk simmons in supporting roles few will dispute the fact that gosling  stone make up for an ideal hollywood couple for their onscreen chemistry is so natural effortless  convincing that it really makes it easy for the audience to see  imagine them as a couple and invest in their relationship its a terrific casting and the remarkable performances these talented actors deliver both individually  as a duo truly elevates an already aweinspiring feature to an even higher levelon an overall scale is this seasons most dazzling movie experience and is a musical masterpiece for the ages bursting with passion overflowing with emotions  intimately capturing the magic of cinema in all its glory it is an irresistible inescapable  infatuating rhapsody thats brought to life with incredible restraint  precision artistry and promises its viewers a toetapping journey that theyre going to cherish for a long time to sum it up damien chazelles is an utter fantasyturnedreality that asks its audience to dream more urgently live more fervently  love more deeply in short they really dont make films like this anymore delightfully recommended,happy
this is a gem ive nothing profound to say here just that this kind of movie only gets made once or twice in a decade its the rare case when dance song and story work together along with talent to make us smile and take us away i cant imagine how a movie like this gets made in this day and age so much has to come together this is the kind of movie i shall wait a few years before seeing again i want it to fade from view so i can enjoy it all over again one thing see it in the theater if you still can if this came back to the movie theater i would definitely go back if you cannot see it in the theater watch it loud and dim the lights,happy

who didnt once had the dream of becoming a movie star or a famous musician even if you only got the tree part in your school play or cant even play triangle you have already at least thought about what your life would be like if you were famous i bet you did this movies about this universal dream played by two individuals who have enough talent and guts to persuade it and they happen to follow in love with each other the rest is art the movie itself is a masterpiece the colors the tunes the choreography its like watching a movie in technicolor just amazing it reminded a lot of the wizard of oz the final scene i think will be forever stuck in my mind as one of the best endings i have ever seen why did i give it a 9 well their connection isnt perfect dont get me wrong both ryan gosling and emma stone are great actors but something is missing lacks chemistry both play their parts masterfully nevertheless they dont get well together they just seem a very unlikely couple i would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals cinema dreams and everything in between,happy
hollywood makes a film about itself from time to time this is one of these kind of films and i loved it i am not sure was the portrayed well in this film for i never went there it seems it was not according to other reviewers but it was not that important what was important was to make a film about the so people understand how actually it is difficult to make it there i think this film makes a good case about all of that dancing and singing not in the rain but on the californian sunshine is excellent and anyone who wants to see a musical should like this film it was like watching fred astaire and ginger rogers again in some futuristic remake so for the sake of relaxation and good mood go and see this film,happy
i walked into this movie late having no idea what it was about having no initiative to see it in the first place some family and friends opted to treat a for a movie and this one seemed ok wow ive never been so unprepared to be swept off my feet by such an intoxicating refreshing and allaround polished film i grew up on movies like singing in the rain with spontaneous song numbers singshot dance sequences and a big hollywood sets this movie hearkens back to the golden age of film with a frankly wonderful soundtrack and equally delightful story of two dreamers and their journey and even if you were never one for oldfashioned movies emma stone and ryan goslings performances are worth the movie itself keeping what is a tempting clich love story innovative and modern enough to engage with anyone admittedly i thought the movie was going to be a bit cheeky but with all it does to maintain a classic movie feel and keep the characters actions settings and thoughts firmly in the present it hits the rare nail on the head by being something we dont see too often any more genuinely entertaining,happy
whiplashwinner of three academy awards one golden globe three baftas among otherswas the shrewd introit of a filmmaker who categorically intended to shake superfluous and commercial hollywood a gallant american with a transcendent and irreplaceable film intellect which has to be perpetuated praised and enjoyed in its entirety in these recession times he is damien chazelle it was the preliminary feature film of three of the most solemn festivals in cinema now chazelle manufactures a modern masterpiece that is going to live on perpetually since not exclusively sketches the reviving of a relegated genre out but runs blindingly and naturally a romantic study aesthetically stunning tunefully stunning narratively stunning and functionally sublimeis titled the third film led by the director this has stars emma stone ryan gosling and j k simmonsalthough with an unusual minor characteramong its ranks several people have pigeonholed it as melodramatic thing with musical taps nevertheless the celluloid transcends its own confines splitting events course within four branches the four seasons which accentuates nature of every chapter in the story however although we are witnesses visibly of a narrative segmentation spectators will not take long to apprehend that it is distributed in three fields directed by different genres and themes what ultimately leads us to say that they are three independent stories correlated each otherthe story relates idealistic couples adventures who lives in the district where professional disillusions of the planet settle hollywood an arbitrary fable which will split up our divergent players she yearns to predominate intransigently in the city of dreams nonetheless her aspirations are crumbling and dying by the unsuccessful castings and his job as an assistant in a coffee shop into warner bros an unbearable face to her suffering on the other hand hes a pianist who makes shows at weddings and private bars in order to open his own pub getting his biggest design protecting and rekindling the jazz exhausted flame later their lives are adventitiously connected after a nocturnal walk in finding their automobiles which originates a passionate love overtakes a series of individual troubles although each of them obtained whom they loved the nature of the unexpected will be at risk and the intrinsic of their relationship will keep them to the edge of the cornice what in hollywood would signify a death foretoldits irrefutable that chazelle does not perform a neophyte exercise about actions which unfold with sections accompanied by singing and dancing since in his directional debut guy and madeleine on a park bench in addition to run notably his first steps within the matter also emerged victorious in emulsifying melodrama with dazzling spontaneities the initial section focuses on setting us in context within the dominant air through choreographic assemblies exuding pure vintage these performances are honest reminiscences from monumental mgm productions top hat singin in the rain the umbrellas of cherbourg an american in paris and more were potential sources for revitalization of classic musicals the first take we detail a broad blue sky by cinemascope going down gently amongst the congested and multitudinous vehicular traffic each individual listens to dissimilar music stylesan analogy will disperse into progressive musicalitythereon another day of sun is the attention epicenter and an ineffable and arduous choreographic display takes place along the vehicle bridge acts recorded in false long takes as if it were irritu a frantic and exciting prelude which adjusts the environment where our main leads are going to get along in the second part grandiose dances ala broadway drastically lessen and are replaced by sentimental treatment and what we cannot forget in a film by the director are the symphonic scores which are maintained potent nevertheless it provides gradually more preponderance on screen to jazz this is where the narrative arcs obtained greater strength and stones and goslings roles shine with profound and authentic performances after it moves through the crazy musical of the first part and the plausible dramatic affair of the second section chazelle concludes with a final flourish with a sudden indefatigable agile and the cunning mechanism in the concomitant of the events which transmute narrative in films it makes you feel as if the tragicomedy would come to an end but indeed one twist more is coming finally choreographic ensembles break out again but this time we have not seen them with the same dynamism and explosiveness dances are carefully chosen to express story grief he provided an inspirational greeting with whiplash with consolidates himself as one of the major american filmmakers permitting stones and goslings performances and entire components of the celluloid to receive a guaranteed nomination at the oscars for this love letter to hollywood cinema,happy
is the latest film from whiplash director damien chazzelle starring emma stone and ryan gosling is a musical that follows mia emma watson who is a struggling actress whose path keeps crossing with sebastien ryan gosling who is an aspiring jazz musician who wants to open his own jazz club and through the course of the film we see their romance flourish to say the least this film is phenomenal from the acting to the music this film is amazing at a certain point in the movie i realized that i didnt dislike a single thing in the film one of the best things i can say about this movie is the music as soon as it started i was entranced from the lyrics to the rhythm it is masterful as soon as the movie was over i wanted to keep listening to the music also the characters are fantastic emma stone gives the best performance of her career as mia and ryan gosling as sebastian was also one of his best which is saying a lot you can feel all of their emotion is on the screen when gosling talks about jazz or mia breaks down because she doesnt think shes good enough these two are at the top of their game now lets talk about the director damien chazzelle this man knows how to direct a film he uses such great camera movement vibrant colors incorporates great music and directs stone and gosling incredibly he uses a lot of tracking shots which i personally loved and incorporated good humor which seemed natural and not out of know where like other movies i dont have any flaws with the movie except of the last ten minutes or so its not that i didnt like it its just that the movie ended in a way that i would have liked to see go a different way it wasnt a bad ending i just personally would have wanted it to go a different directionother than the last ten or so minutes no complaints here the movie was nearly flawless it had great characters songs choreography colors direction and acting i walked out of the theater with a smile on my face and humming the music and would highly recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible and i would give an a,happy
masterpiece  best movie in 2016 ryan showed us his piano skills emma showed us her acting skills ryans performance is really good and emmas performance is great the opening scene is perfect and the song another day of sun is really good  damien chazelle did it well which is six minutes long comes before the opening credits i thought that its only one shot but it was three shots  its one of the films most spectacular scenes im not into musical movies but this movie is different  it made me want to see all musical movies jk simmons is one of the cast but he didnt have a big role in this movie he was good and funny damien chazelle deserves to be nominated for 2 oscars best director  best screenplay and he has a big chance to win all soundtracks are great but i prefer city of stars  the fools who dreams  a lovely night  start a fire the final scene is awesome and unexpected what a waste of a lovely night ,happy
i am not a fan of musicals for two reasons 1 i dont find them realistic and 2 i dont like that the plot gets second and the songs first so going to watch this movie i was psychologically prepared that i wouldnt like it but i absolutely loved it i liked the sense it left you that dreams do come true if you stick to them i liked the sense of love not as something possessive but to lead the other to get as high as heshe can get i liked the songs that were there helping the plot to rise and not to hide it under the music in the beginning of the film i was shocked i almost started to grieve for the money i gave because it brought to me bad memories of the bad musicals of 60s though while it kept on it got me in a magical world which had sadness but still dreams could come true on the actors their chemistry was like amazing and they could make you feel what thy felt i never appreciated gosling so much but through his latest works he has proved me wrong and emma stone i think her to be one of the very best as she has the talent and the movement the voice and the right choices the director was as expected amazing i expected nothing less than magical from him i particularly liked that he gave his musical a social aspect which is really impressive he made his move something other than a passatempo he made it actually matter also i must refer to the photography the scenes and the costumes usually we dont see so bright colours in the cinema and there is a reason for that but these guys really made it work amazing all in all i think that this is a movie everyone can and should watch i recommend it,happy
first of all i hate musicals i really do by my opinion movies should be just about acting singing just makes them look ridiculous but thats my personal opinion and if you share my view than this review might be useful for youto be honest the only reason why i went to see this movie is the fact that i have a cinema season ticket i didnt have any expectations and maybe thats main part of the reason why i really liked it there is not that much singing and even when actors sing it blends nicely to the plot  it just doesnt look silly also the soundtrack is amazing basically its just one melody throughout the whole movie but its very catchy and you will end up humming the tune for the rest of the daybut back to the movie its a love story its not original but still quite nice and it has the potential to raise emotions i enjoyed it and i was really surprised how much entertaining it was also the acting is actually very good especially the parts where the actor is trying to be an actor she is very convincingthis is only third movie of the director but when you take in mind that it was directed by the same person who created whiplash and 10 cloverfield lane than you must know that it will be good as i enjoyed both his previous movies a lotso in short this movie is worth your time pure entertainment but be aware that the ending might surprise you,happy
liked everything about it acting singing dancing direction screenplay etc and it all works cant remember when i saw a more entertaining picture i am a big fan of movie musicals and strictly speaking is a musical with some tuneful original songs and a few dance numbers it starts off with a production number in a highway traffic jam  right off the bat you say to yourself this will be a special picturemidway through it switches gears into a straight romantic drama leaving the singing and dancing behind by that time though you are thoroughly invested in the story and you hardly notice gosling and stone are not known as singers and dancers but they get through just fine he with a three day growth of beard and she with a senorwenceshandpuppet endearing face writerdirector chazelle has put together a movie which will draw some oscar noms come academy award time a rare picture with no apparent flawsjust saw it again and it was better the second time the no vote crowd will be very disappointed at aa time and apparently some no votes have gone to every single high rating and voted no what the point is i dont know but its very coincidental and doesnt fool all the people to paraphrase a republican president,happy
so a few hours before i had been brought by damien chazelle on an unforgettable musical adventure i had been searching through imdb like i do for hours every day and found this poll about the top directors under 40 years of age but this poll took me by surprise like no other previously has you know why i was scrolling through for about five minutes wondering wondering why why wasnt damien chanzelle even given the respect he deserves because can you believe it this man is only 31 31 and look what hes done hes terrific so this poll took me by great surprise to the reason being damien wasnt even on the list he wasnt even respected enough to on the list damien needs to be recognized to a full he certainly came into the the film industry full of great ideas and proving his future value with his fantastic film debut of whiplashanyway so moving on its very obvious that this man loves his music though this unforgettable glory of damien takes you on a trip you never thought youd undertake hes mixed the late musicals not to mention his outstanding camera work going back to the traditional no cut sequences and the romantic flicks of near after and hes done a terrific job at it i had never expected what i would see once i stepped into the cinema and sat in the slightly comfortable but not all too thrilling red seats this film was spectacular in every way it brought terrific camera work i say terrific it cant get better than damien chazelles camera work his directing is exquisite its original its breath taking its eye catching its not to be missed i literally did not blink throughout the whole film thats how unmissable this soon to be classic is damien chazelle is soon to be a film making legend hes got an entertaining future ahead of himself and im sure hes not going to let anyone forget that just waitmy rating 9610,happy
yes this film would be the sequel to correct all the flaws of lastory you hire a better director chazelle steve martin in previous you get an actress w better acting chopsemma stonepreviously in easy a movie than sarah jessica parkerplus a better script but mostly it is basically the same movie same romantic comedyexcept one is decidedly a screwball comedy of a love trianglelots of music set against the backdrop of freeway billboards in present day la but i will see it again recommended to see in imax screen version this movie will be a good antidote for all the bad moviesshall remain unnamedi have seen in 2016,happy
its actually a bit shocking to see damien chazelle produce this masterpiece after having directed whiplash which is arguably the best film of 2014 at this point i wouldnt be surprised if most audiences having watched feel that gazelles latest work is once again the best of the year its perhaps redundant to say so but like whiplash is musically intensive the difference being that while whiplash was a grounded real world narrative centered around music is more so a musical in the classic sense scenes taking place in a grounded narrative transition seamlessly into elaborately choreographed song and dance numbers which are a far cry from the intense jazz drama of whiplash though jazz is prevalent in the score for this film the great thing about this film being so dramatically and stylistically different from whiplash is that chazelle takes full advantage of the format to elevate his musical far above its peers from the opening shot its evident that every song and dance number has been carefully blocked and rehearsed resulting in the camera effortlessly navigating the halls and roadways of every scene and allowing the audience to fully soak in the talent on screen to speak of the talent on screen its needless to say that all performances meet the standard of excellence that chazelle set for himself and his actors during whiplash though the bouncy and fast paced tone doesnt always allow for the most profound character depth the emotions and nuances of those characters are on full display with each song dance and montageas far as those songs dances and montages are concerned that is perhaps where objectivity gets muddled for me while i enjoyed the music in this film greatly and appreciate the subtle variations on what seems to be the main theme i am fairly ignorant where music theory is concerned i honestly love the music in this film and would say that its great but someone who is better versed in the field may have a different perspective the point is that if you dont like the music or dont think its good then im not sure what to say i think its great but maybe it would be more appropriate to say that i really liked itthe reason i liked the music beyond it being pleasurable to listen to is that it was utilized perfectly to emphasize the tone of every scene and give context to the emotional state of the characters the main theme is repeated several times to the point where some might be irritated with its prevalence in the film that theme however changes subtly for each appearance creates different meanings for the characters and their relationships depending on those subtle changes this film is an absolute masterpiece and arguably surpasses whiplash hopefully in the near future chazelle returns with yet another masterpiece to rival his latest,happy
there are two things that can really win me over in a movie great music and a great ending has both and then somecoming off of whiplash one of the best films of 2014 the pressure was on damien chazelle to come up with something to top what he did previously not only did he cowrite 13 cloverfield lane earlier this year but he finally got to direct his passion project in fact the very plot of the film echoes chazelles relentless devotion to getting this film made all these years and for the most part the result is magical surely theres nothing like it you will see this year like many classic musicals of the 40s and 50ss narrative tends to wander into dreamy and surreal territories but its at its best when it is simply telling the story of two ambitious artists in los angeles one a jazz musician and the other an aspiring actress i think chazelles vision would have been fine with other actors but theres no question that a ton of credit has to go to ryan gosling and emma stone their chemistry bolsters this story and really is why i cared so much about these characters both of them will be nominated and both of them deserve to be their relationship through triumphs and struggles may be the best romance of the yearis one of those movies that doesnt really hit you until the car ride home or even a few days after sometimes the wandering plot and the inconsistent presence of musical numbers is frustrating but it all leads to one satisfying ending so much so that i significantly upped my score because of how hard the ending hit me it isnt predictable or easy in fact because the ending wasnt what i originally hoped made me enjoy it even more the final few shots gave me a whole movies worth of emotion and it made it worth it in the endthis is clearly a tribute to the musicals of the golden age of hollywood and also a constant reminder at the brilliance of jazz music but i found the touching romance and struggle of these two artists to be the most rewarding aspect to the beautiful score and equally subtle and swashbuckling songs contribute to one epic theater experience im still processing how i feel about the film as a whole but im certainly pleased that i saw itstone  gosling chemistrymusicunpredictablesatisfying endingmiddle act wanders1010,happy
i found the music and story sweet and heartbreaking all at once it was so believable and real that i felt at any moment i could hop right on the screen and join them a true love letter to the city of starsas far as the musical partit was exceptionally done they sang and danced in points that seemed critical to the development of their relationship and although those scenes could be quite fantastical they were symbolic of how people feel when they are falling in lovei laughed i cried i wanted to dance i wanted to sing my heart had a funny tug at the endwhat more can you ask for in a movie heres to the dreamers,happy
all i needed was one whiff of the original trailer for this film accompanied by goslings city of stars and i was in love i really loved damien chazelles whiplash im generally a fan of films driven by music and that film was a great student v teacher scenario however this was on another level and felt so honed there are so many things about this picture that i want to applaud and i know that if i watched it again i could probably write another essay on a set of different things about this that i enjoyedfrom the very opening scene the films aura is set the musical numbers are expertly choreographed and the multitude of vibrant colors are present very often some of the scenes are just so gorgeous and pulsating there are scenes where the backdrop of la looks magnificent the original songs are very good even if you do not appreciate a particular song you will love the busy work on the screen there is something going on in every frame your eyes will be glued to something city of stars is such a catchy tune i wasnt surprised that ryan gosling was able to sing and perform on the piano as im a big fan of that hunk and know he has his own band apparently he learned the piano for this film which is insane especially if he played the piano for all of his scenes you would think hes been at it for years i think there is good chemistry between emma stone and ryan gosling emma stones character is identifiable shes the prototype of someone who has high ambitions passion and is unsure of whether others would feel the same way i found this very real theres an inherent theme of having a dream and how much hard work is involved in succeeding in that dream its tough to accomplish the dream because not everyone will feel the same way or identify with what you are doing at times you have to take the practical road in life however if you stay on course for your passion you may achieve something down the road this resonated so much for me and i loved it but i dont want to get stuck in talking about that before i go off another tangent let me just say that this was the best performance by emma stone yet both leads had to show a bit of versatility for this film and they did very wellid say theres not much else going on with the other characters outside of the two leads the spotlight is on gosling and stone the entire time and i liked it that way the set designs within the film were eye popping and beautiful to look at a lot of this film is a love letter to hollywood you see it in the ingrid bergman the marilyn monroe painting and other places throughout the film the film is essentially a tribute and revival of 50s hollywood which is another reason why i really liked this film the musical genre is sort of dying in hollywood much like jazz in real life and in the film i did not like jazz growing up until i took an intro to jazz class in college and started appreciating the art form so much goes into jazz its improvisation and i appreciated the pioneers of the genre who paved the way of not only other musicians of the genre but popular musicians in other genres to follow i loved that goslings character was enamored with jazz and its history the two leads are so passionate about what they love another thing that resonated for me the mix of music and cinema blended so well togetherthe last twenty or so minutes of the film honestly floored me and i really wouldnt change any of it i think a lot of people will enjoy this film from a technical standpoint i think this is definitely the best picture frontrunner it doesnt have that heavy handed emotionally dramatic plot that the academy loves but everything else about it screams the favorite for the oscar chazelle did a fantastic job of mixing his love for jazz music and film and finding symmetry with this film id have to compile a list of the best films of the year but this will be somewhere near the very top very pleased withone final thing my man crush on ryan gosling has grown tenfold the guy can rock a suit better than anyone in hollywood and is as charming as they get910,happy
damien chazelle is a fantastic writer and director chazelle has made two major movies that i know about whiplash and both of these movies are absolutely fantastic and ill definitely be looking forward to what damien chazelle does nextis a good film but i wont be adding it to my favorite 2016 movies list however i would watch this thing again because i liked it i enjoyed a lot of what this movie had to offer but i just felt like some things fell short and it didnt reach its full potentialpros  consprosryan goslings performance was good emma stones performance was goodryan goslings  emma stones onscreen chemistry was sensationalthe movie was charming the directing was masterfully crafted the color scheme was vibrant i enjoyed the old school film vibe and i thought it blended well with its modern setting the dance numbers were spectacularly choreographed a majority of the songs were pleasant touching and poignant audition the fools who dream  the ending were the most poignant moments in the film another day of sun audition the fools who dream and the ending were my favorite dance numbers and sceneslife is difficult its not easy to accomplish your goals and its particularly difficult to accomplish things when the people around you are mostly intransigentcons there were one too many coincidences throughout the film i felt like some scenes were just setup to bring certain circumstances into play certain direction or execution of scene choices felt clichd there wasnt an exfoliating emphasis on the two main characters i knew what was to be expected before the film endedparticular moments during certain scenes felt obligatoryoverall i really enjoyed for what it was its a musical but its also about never giving up on yourself we all have dreams and goals sometimes are dreams can seem overwhelming but its important to never lose sight of what we truly want for ourselves and its good to have someone that believes in youfinal grade b,happy
is the perfect movie for contemporary society after the second world war happy escapist films became popular and now with all the current negativity of war in the middle east and terrorism along with our economic woes similarly allows us a short respite from reality the soundtrack is memorable and addictive particularly the music of justin hurwitz city of stars its a simple familiar and relatable love story intertwined around career dreams the photography is engaging while the outdoor locations are familiar yet have a fantasy quality due to the incredible camera work colorful costumes add a nostalgic quality appropriated from the 1950s ryan gosling and emma stone are no fred astaire and ginger rogers but the dance sequences are well choreographed to catchy music the jazz music may also convert naysayers of the music genre overall a movie that will make you laugh cry and swoon i hope damien chazelle makes more of these types of films violent films are pass,happy
when i was finished watching the first song of the movie i know i am going to like itmade me smile all the way till the end it is well written well scored well directed or should i say choreographed it was like that damien chazelle succeeded to do exactly what he had in mind i laughed and i sighed like a 14yearold schoolgirl i am still hearing those songs as i am writing this 2 hours after i watched itthe performers have done a great job i like emma stone but was not a fan of ryan gosling now i definitely am both of them gave a phenomenal performance everything in this film it just fitsbut what will sweep you off your feet are the songs 2 songs in particular city of stars and fools who dream for me these two are going to be the top two songs in the playlisti will recommend it to all of them who liked whiplash those who love musicals and even those who would want to watch just a romantic flick,happy
i will keep this short but this film is an utter delight glorious to look at and an absolute valentine to los angeles romance and jazz i promise you will be smiling throughout marveling at its nod to musicals of the past but just how contemporary it feels the chemistry between stone and gosling rings so true and heartbreaking both give it their all most especially stone whose gorgeous eyes and natural presence is a marvel of screen presence i heartily recommend this one of if not the best film of 2016 it is an absolutely wonderful 2 hours at the movies for every age leaving the viewer exiting the theater on a cloud of optimism and joy,happy
in some ways this is a lovely movie with a wonderful homage to old hollywood musicals and a romantic if slightly derivative and simplistic main musical theme the cinematography is nostalgic and the musical numbers are for the most part quite good i liked them except for the glee like freeway opening number generally they were not over done less is more the romantic observatory number is a standoutthe story of a the different careers of music and acting pulling them apart is a familiar one the modern twist is the poignant ending and what if flashback they could have made things work if she had just gone back to him after her movie a happy ending would have been too old fashioned i guess but the story is a bit of a downerryan gosling  kudos to him for singing and dancing not many successful screen actors of his generation are capable of it he doesnt have a broadway caliber voice by any means or snappiness in his dancing but it doesnt matter  its his screen presence that brings in the crowds emma stone is slim and dances satisfactorily  her voice is acceptable if not that lovely there are too many closeups of her face her face isnt really beautiful the two performances arent as high a standard as those of the multi talented mgm stars of the golden age of hollywood  those who could actually sing dance and act they dont dance for very longits just so good that movie makers of this generation are trying to do this type of musical on screen again  maybe it will pave the way for some successful broadway actors and actresses to get big screen roles they deserve the broader audience has missed out on a lot of fine talent the last couple of decades if only the music was more sophisticated and better written,happy
review with spoilersnoted actorsmia emma stone  sebastian ryan goslingstorylinea struggling actress and a struggling jazz pianist one too many chance encounters lead them to actual pursue each others company and make a vested interest in each other but like with any film dealing with romance as things change dreams are realized or die can the relationship still survivehighlightsemma stonewith no shade to ryan gosling this movie was really about stone her charm was on high those big doe eyes of hers were in full effect and she had the same comic appeals which made her a star in easy a though what really made this a highlight is stone wasnt tasked with trying to break the mold on what we know her for and as what i mean by that is she isnt suddenly trying to pull a tilda swinton or meryl streep out of her back pocket she pushes the boundary of what we may expect from her but not so much that it would look like she is trying to prove something like this film doesnt seem like she is out here trying to prove she is a serious actress who shouldnt be pigeonholed she knows what she is good at and expands on what we are used to seeing by adding song and dance numbers alongside giving a bit more depth to her character than we are used to allowing you more so to ease into the idea that she may not always choose to be a goof ball romantic interest or the supporting role to a stronger characterthe dance and music numbersto be honest i wasnt walking into this movie thinking or knowing it was a musical i knew stone would be singing music and gosling would play a piano but i wasnt expecting at least 5 or 6 verbal songs and a lot of jazz music on top of that i wasnt expecting tap dance numbers and things of that nature but let me tell you they were such a welcomed surprise for while gosling you expect to be adept at it since he grew up in the house of mouse stone does seem like the type with two left feet and who sings off pitch for fun plus youd kind of expect her to be tone deaftruth is stone gives as good as gosling when it comes to the dance numbers and watching them move together reminds you why for decades one of the main exports out of hollywood were grandeur musicals for the songs oh the songs whether goslings jazz music of which a song or two feature john legend or listening to stone sing you could go from something that makes you want to groove to perhaps cry and maybe even want a nap its such a whirlwind that you do get to understand why so many nominations are being announced for this movie and why it is being awarded accoladescriticismone key question about them goes unansweredconflict is necessary in any movie and with romantic movies the conflict is usually somewhere out of left field and is usually the low point this movie despite everything else is no different the problem is why we are made aware of what may have caused the major rift but there is no exact detail did they grow apart did their careers just consume so much of their time they broke up and decided to become friends friends which kept aware of what the other was doing but didnt have much communication think friends you had in high school or college you are connected with on social media but never speak to this isnt answered we are just teased with a possible way the movie could end which for some maybe unrealisticoverall positive worth seeing  recommendedif i was to be perfectly honest if stone wins an award for this it is because of her doing a golden age of hollywoodstyle musical and because of her charm acting wise while this character has more depth and consistent growth than her past roles she isnt at that point yet where she really grabs you she is still is one of the most entertaining actresses of this generation but this is but a taste of what is to come more so than perhaps the best she may ever put out there as for gosling he kind of is forgettable the movie does its best to keep him from being a second fiddle with bringing in a sister for him an old friend in john legends character and giving him a life outside mia but ultimate stone eclipses him in almost all aspects outside of the song and dance numbers in those moments they are equals and they make this movie more than just another romantic film they remind you of the actors of yore who could sing dance act and tell a quality joke something sorely missed and why i fully expect to probably watch this more than once in my lifetime,happy
the wildly beloved oscar frontrunner is just as mystifying as critics and audiences said it was the sweeping cinematography the perfect strategically placed lighting the performances the dance numbersit all makes exactly what people were not expecting out of 21st century musical this is a mystifying burst of classical hollywood filmmaking to that effect there is nothing new rather just a new voice to an old dialog directed by damien chazzelle is an analytical odyssey of the price of fame as told through the eyes of two big dreamers an aspiring actress emma stone and a struggling jazz musician ryan gosling as they coast through life in los angeles emma stone and ryan gosling are fantastic in this film emma stone gives a career best performance and seems to be riding the same prestigious wave she caught with 2014s birdman gosling is equally great but weve come to expect this type of performance from him the charismatic dreamer with a golden tongue fits gosling a little too well at this point even if he does it better than any other working actor in hollywood while the film is well acted and the choreography in the dance numbers are mesmerizing is still a hard film to recommend to anyone not already gung ho for musicalsdespite being toted as the best film of the year is exceptionally underwritten trading great storytelling for grand musical numbers that are expertly planned and executed damien chazzelle knows the films strengths and weaknesses while he plays off of the films strengths in an expert fashion he does very little to cover up the films number one weakness its script however despite this being a weakness chazzelle does a wonderful job at making us forget the problems and sinks us into enjoying the film for what its worthoverall is most certainly an ambitious yet flawed musical from damien chazzelle which proves that whiplash was far from a fluke featuring a career best performance from emma stone and brilliant camera work along with excellent choreography in its musical numbers is a film that will most certainly leave you feeling satisfied even if it doesnt hold the lasting power of whiplash,happy
is a beautiful movie by damien chazelle that brought back everything we love and adore about old musicals and brought the genre back in our lives is basically a movie about a movie  it is masterpiece that follows the lives of sebastian who is an aspiring musician and mia who is an aspiring actress the story follows the lives of these two artists  separately at first until their paths cross and they become the point of support and motivation for each other even though the plot takes some time to develop and in the first part of the movie you are not really sure of the direction it will take i thoroughly enjoyed watching it obviously it is not a perfect movie and it had its cringey moments that are so hollywood ly obvious like when all of a sudden there was a very important casting director at mias show and she has one final audition that would of course change her life and give her everything she dreamed of what i specifically liked about sebastians character and his development is that he did not stick with the band but he ended up opening the bar and even though his dreams did come true there is still mention of how the bar is doing just fine  it is not the number one place in la to have a drink in which gives it the more realistic and less fairy tale ending unlike miashowever if we neglect those minor details i think the movie ended on a good note not many movies have a great script combined with the great director and i think what damien chazelle did with the ending was amazing as this was in fact a movie about movies he did in film what directors do in real time  they film several endings only to decide in last minute which one to use and chazelle gave us an alternate ending in addition to the real oneif i were to focus less on the plot of the movie and more on its style of filming lighting and cinematography in general i would say this movie was destined to be a classic it pays beautiful homage to the classic musicals from 1950s and if this movie were in black and white i am sure everybody would agree that it would blend into era carelessly though damien chazelle has the advantage of digital technology to assist him in how movie is photographed edited and distributed to the public over directors in the 50s he used them very elegantly and has created a beautiful art piece that is obviously a result of combined efforts of many artists who worked on the movieemma stone was just fantastic and delivered beyond my and i believe many expectations and although i am not a huge fan of ryan gosling i must admit that he was just amazing and was a perfect cast for the role of sebastian as he delivered the character so seamlessly justin hurwitz did an incredible job on the score and the music follows the storyline and the character development perfectly the only thing i would hold against him is that for a movie in which main character is obsessed with jazz there was not enough jazz music but otherwise i loved the score linus sandgren and tom cross also did a fantastic job in cinematography and editing and mary zophres just excelled with costume design every color of every dress every suit and every outfit was planned in detail and fit the old musical vibe as well as the new modern era in which the movie was actually taking place in set decoration and production design by sandy reynoldswasco and david wasco is what impressed me the most again little details that were randomly placed around set were hidden enough that they did not take away from whats on the screen but at the same time when combined together they created that what made this movie feel like a set in 1950s while at the same time we see that main characters are in fact driving modern cars and using iphones all the decisions based around decorations set production design and costumes among others fit right into philosophy of the big studio era which is that aesthetic elements of the film should be maximized  and there we have  beautiful movie with beautiful peoplethe lighting of the movie is absolutely on point and perfect my favorite part about watching the movie was figuring the meaning of colors in it if you happen to see it more than once you will be able to realize how sebastians color is blue while mias color is red and when they are together and in love they are surrounded by purple chazelle obviously never ceases to amaze with his devotion to detail and color was no exception movement is another part in which this movie excelled because the dances the grimacing emotion and acting perfectly matched character development plot twists and scoreoverall you are guaranteed to love if you are a fan of old musicals and if you are into discovering meaning behind every costume dress color and act if you loved the 50s and wish you could somehow relieve the era this movie is guaranteed to take you back in time and it will do that with such detail precision and a perfect blend of now and then that it will feel like a dream once the credits role after the final scene is over,happy
this movie has some fantastic shots in it and it manages to bring some of the amazement you can get from watching an actual musical live the songs are mostly not that memorable but theyre always welcome when they come theyre also spaced out in an interesting way fitting with the emotional flow of the movie the actors do a terrific job playing their partseven though i can easily get caught in nostalgia i am also quite wary of it this movie delves in it but luckily it does in a way that feels thought through and in the end it seems like it comes to terms with the fact that the present aint so bad either you can try to recreate the past or you can bring the positive aspects of the past with you as you head into the future to me the latter is the most appealing and its how i felt this movie handled itall of that said the movie never excels its a nice musical with great acting impressive shots and a nice setting  and it deserves praise for all of those things the complete package works nicely but it its no great loss to miss out on this movie,happy
i loved the leads but was sadly disappointed in the film the songs were just okay  nothing to write home about the dancing was just okay the singing was awful the whole time i kept thinking  this will pick up and get better in a little while it never did it was 2 hours and 8 minutes thats way too long for a musical with such a weak script and mediocre songs the film was about two people who want to be in the entertainment business who meet and have a connection after about three tries i was looking so forward to seeing this and maybe i built it up too much in my mind and by all the hype at awards time i just felt let down in the end and thought thats 208 hours of my life ill never get back if you want to see it rent it at redboxi realize this was not supposed to be a musical done by professional singers and dancers but i go to the movies to be wowed not put to sleep i guess this movie really meant something to people in the industry and about their struggles in making it big but i am not one of those people i go to the movies to escape reality not be a part of it hollywood should stop making movies about itself its only interesting to those in the industry not outside it,happy
i was about to close the movie but my husband said why so i watched it i am so sick of musical movies but there was a lot of music but not too much after the beginning it was a very good movieit is a pretty much movie for middle 30s years people looking for a future and following your dreams,happy

i certainly enjoyed this musical and definitely recommend it for anyone to see i did give it a 9 rating out of 10 simply because i think that it could have been done much better i had to watch the movie with the thought in mind that both emma stone and ryan gosling are not debbie reynolds and fred astaire but i think that they did the absolute best that they could for modern times therefore it is wrong to expect them to meet the standards of 50s actors who could sing and dance on top of actingi really loved the storyline and loved it how they showed that in order to reach your dream you have to sacrifice it definitely showed me how we take what actors do very for granted and how society has this onesided understanding of what sacrifice really is they certainly sacrifice no less just to keep the public entertainedi somehow feel that they could have trained them up a bit more in tap dancing to do the main dance montage scene in the movie which is mainly why i gave the movie a 9 rating the singing wasnt bad at all for actors who are not accustomed singing in movies i have heard a lot worse in my life once again i feel its not fair to have west side storylike expectations of actors in todays musicals simply because they are not cheap to make in todays market and theres not a big demand for them like there was in the 50s and before chicago is the only musical in my humble opinion that strongly rivals the classics in movie formwhile a lot of folks didnt like the ending too much and yes it is indeed an emotional ending i like it that it was made to be open to interpretation it certainly got me thinking deep about all the other possibilities that could have happened between the two main characters while watching the movie at the theater i certainly do recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals but would advise to watch it without high expectations that its going to be just as good as a 50s musical,happy
is pure entertainment i am not a fan of musicals is a mantra of mine and while i did not exactly have a damascene conversion here i was drawn in by the sincerity of the mission the scale of the production and most of all by emma stones moving complex performance her comedy is spot on in the auditions where she is given some wonderfully awful line readings but the next moment she is brittle and vulnerable and the switch and range is quite brilliant gosling struggles to match her achieving pass marks rather than a goldstar performance the ending is a masterclass in visual storytelling an extended sequence that plays out without dialogue and will resonate with anyone who has wondered about two diverging paths in a forest and what lay down the one we chose not to take is escapism hollywood fairytale at its best the clue is in the title of course give yourself over to it and you will not be disappointed,happy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning mia emma stone is a barista on a hollywood film set who dreams of becoming a famous actress but keeps having bad luck on auditions she crosses paths with sebastian ryan gosling a brash abrasive musician who also wants to make it big and is frustrated at anyones inability to appreciate jazz although irritated by sebastians manner mia does admire his musical ability and on this tender footnote they develop a friendship that blossoms into romance and the ups and downs their paths take from this pointdamian chazelles glossy celebration of hollywood from a time gone by suffered at the cruel mocking hands of fate in the most humiliating of ways over the last fortnight when the unbelievable drama of oscars night unfolded across the mainstream media and after being announced as the winner of best picture it turned out this was a mistake and the award actually went to the urban drama moonlight while drawing more attention to this catastrophic farrago seems tactless i had been planning to see it even if this hadnt happened and oscar embarrassment aside its still a swirling magical reignition of a genre that was popular in the golden age of hollywoodwhile its a celebration of something from a bygone age its very much updated to modern times capturing all the funk style and spirit of the modern music and fashion scene and so enthralling to those who are fans of musicals from the olden days and appealing to those who are up on current trends considering the nature of both the main characters lead stars gosling and stone are inspired choices since their personalities match their demeaneurs so well goslings moody withdrawn but appealing character perfectly complimenting stones sturdy downtrodden but hopeful and resilient heroineand just so it doesnt forget what it is that makes it so appealing to modern audiences the song and dance numbers are perfectly magical too really springing to life at the right moments and lighting up an already beautiful homage to the bygone musical ,happy
the way the main character played by gosling plays jazz for his love interest played by stone in the end when he sees that shes saddened that their not together with the whole music being played by him in such a way that it takes her to a perfect imaginary world where they lead perfect life with each other starting from the first time she was attracted to him and all the way till she came to his dream jazz bar such a beautiful piece of imagination this is not your average musicaldrama movie this is a new genre that just toys with the audiences emotions by both sounds and visuals i dont know why people are giving it negative reviews i dont care what sort of technical mistakes there were in the making of this movie but i simply sat back and enjoyed the art of heartbreak,happy
is exactly what its whimsical and upbeat title would entail a masterfully directed wonderfully delightful visually vibrant and painstakingly realistic musical the films tremendous success and acclaim may leave some disappointed that are expecting the next great genre film although this film is not excellent it certainly sings a catchy memorable tunethis is one of the few films i have seen that made me wish people could just randomly break out into a synchronized song and dance the music is perfect for the magical vibrancy of the dance sequences the director damien chazelle was definitely oscar worthy especially by mimicking alejandro gonzlez irritus tracking shots in birdman and the revenant  tracking shots done right are always deserving of an oscar ryan gosling and emma stone together create a convincing romance full of humor hope charm and blistering sadness the most surprising thing about is its handling of themes such as dreams vs reality and how much it takes to chase those dreams the filmmakers were not afraid to take risks with the story those risks paid off because the movie was bitterly realistic when it could have easily been clich the only problem with the film is that it took awhile for any kind of conflictdrama to emerge resulting in a semi dragged out narrativefor me was as good as a musical could have been musicals are my least favorite genre i enjoyed it for what it was and it was definitely deserving of those fourteen oscar nominations and six wins its really the only film that actually made me want to start singing and dancing at the end of it too bad it got steve harveyd,happy
this movie energy is very high and makes you feel very happy the music is really good excellent cinematography music and a beautiful story certainly film that deserves an oscar with beautiful visuals stirring music and a touching story is a thrillingly ambitious film that pays homage to classic hollywood musicals while also standing fully on its own,happy
ineffable a too great or extreme to be expressed or described with wordsi think that movies are an art and the point of art is to move you to make you feel something to make you feel alive did this incomparably its whimsical colorful big bright and beautiful i felt as though i had floated straight out of my seat to spin among the stars with them its something like laughing in sunlight walking while dizzy looking at the stars violently purple sunsets the coolness of tears on your skin laughing out loud the sinking feeling after waking up from an amazing dream driving fast dancing without a care in the world spinning in circles until youre laughing on the floor with the world spinning hugging someone as tight as you can and the heat of the sun on your skin all wrapped into one ineffable movie,happy
i have enjoyed every movie that emma stone and ryan gosling have appeared in together but this was the best one so far i had always been a ryan gosling fan but it took me awhile to warm up to stone though i think she is fantastic now i think i really became a fan after seeing her lip sync battle with jimmy fallon she has a cute way about her and her handling of emotional scenes is pretty great very slight spoiler belowi thought the ending of was very well done showing the sacrifices people make to reach their goalsdreams can be very painful choices and also made me wonder what different choices could have been made to still be together while not selling out on ones goals,happy
this film is a quick journey through the road of love and success hopes and dreams accomplishment and despair love and broken hearts this movie is not exactly a musical is a story where specific important scenes were told by music but still the film shows life is never meant to be perfect it cant never be perfect in the way decisions has to be made in order to follow our destiny,happy
yes i liked it and my friend was touched by it some parts went a bit weird and others seemed to drag on i am not a huge musical person so maybe thats why i didnt give it an 8 i did like the story line thats how life goes and it was sad at the end both actors did well i would watch it again but only 1 more time,happy
i enjoyed the movie overall it had some great creative scenes in it that really stood out the opening traffic scene was well done as was the observatory scenesand the last remembrancewhat may have been scene was well done but not 100 effective for me as explained below these scenes take you back to the great musicals of yesteryearhowever the music wasnt memorable and the singing was mediocre i know the lack of great singing was intentional but i have yet to hear a valid reason as to why it actually makes the movie better great singing can really elevate a musical the story was pretty weak and the characterizations one dimensional even for a musicaland lastly that bittersweet finale just didnt make sense and was forced spoilersit goes like thismia i love you seb you are the love of my lifesee i love you too miamia seb i have to go paris for a few months for a jobsee really goodbye have a nice lifethen apparently neither one gives a rats ass about the other to keep in touch and although living in the same city make no effort to get back in contact so after five years she sees him in a club and we are supposed to get all misty eyed just didnt work for me anyway the movie has some great scenes but not enough tying those scenes together to make it a great film,happy
i really really enjoyed this movie i entered it with the expectation of a typical musical for the more romantic people but well even if it started that way it absolutely wasntthe story of this couple obviously made for each other started actually romantic and funny but ended bittersweet escorted by a very good matching and equally beautiful soundtrack it took me completely at the end even the singing of emma stone and ryan gosling was way better than expectedalso you can really identify with the two main characters especially if you are also a fool who dreams,happy
i dont normally subscribe to musicals but i was amazed by the opening number and the subsequent 120 minutes which followed some would argue that the realistic aspects of the film clash with the musical numbers but they offer a contrast between the dreamlike illusion of movies and the every day facade of life damien chazelle has emerged as a director to watch out for his previous film whiplash was in my opinion the best film of 2014 and chazelle has done it once more for 2016 both films feature endings that are as thrilling as they are emotionally satisfyingmike,happy
by no means is a movie people will talk for a long timei couldnt see immediately so i have already heard too much several awards but people saying to be a little disappointed so i went with less expectations and therefore i enjoyed itit seems like a simple line but at the same time underneath is the human comedy and tragedythe cinematography is beautiful like entering in other world colors and wardrobe are fantastici love jazz therefore i did enjoyed the music is extraordinary and luring i read critics against the musical capability of actors but i found it authentic in some numbers is just gorgeousi am not sure how to judge acting but i guess it convinced me once you accept the premises of the film so fair enough for me emma is not the most beautiful actress but is so attractive particularly her smile not spoilers but i expected a different finale but perhaps this way of twisting is what make the movie even more controversialgo with no expectations and judge it yourself,happy
amazing movie  rayan gosling at his best  this kind of cinema of should come to india  such a concept would definitely work back here  now about the movie  its completely griping which takes you on a emotional ride  the musicals were on point emma stone did a good job too ,happy
the trailers for didnt do much to entice me to go see it but i have to admit that any doubts i had were wiped out of my mind the moment the film started i couldnt believe they managed to pull off a complicated musical number in one shot on an la freeway of all places thats quite an opening from there were introduced to our two leads  emma stone and ryan gosling  who still clearly have chemistry left over from their previous film together its such a joy to watch them on screen together its hard not to find them sympathetic the story isnt anything we havent seen before in stuff like a star is born but the witty dialogue stars chemistry and musical numbers help set it apart sure gosling and stone are far from trained singers or dancers but they do just fine their voices never soar like youd expect from a big broadway belter but then again they have a camera 3 inches away from their faceif i had any nitpicks it would be that the sound mixing is sometimes a bit off in the opening musical sequence i couldnt really understand the lyrics either due to bad mixing or the singers whisper singing if its playing near you definitely go check it out,happy
hollywood and its glamour is just the vehicle to grab your visual attention and its spectacularly done well and as the story develops it never loses the basic human experience of hope and having a dream and those who come in and out of your life who supported and loved you in that dream and visa versa all of the horrible nasty reviews on here just means that the movie is on target ask yourselves am i living my dream was it trampled on growing up did i let my dream die did someone believe in me when i didnt and am i bitter resentful and regretful that i stopped growing when others didnt this movie gets right to the point as to why we should strive to live our lives to the fullest and take those risks no matter what it was also a thrill to see such glamour in a hollywood film again stunning just stunning i was moved to tears and overwhelmed as i knew that i had lived their experiences emotionally too this movie is a vehicle to process grief regret loss and joy and love and so much more,happy
so i finally went out and saw lala land before it was no longer in theaters i was expecting a dancetastic tv commercial type deal where a bunch of people continuously come out of nowhere and dancing to the camera and actually this is exactly how it begins after 10 minutes i was ready to make my move for a refund but i decided to give it more time and wow was i rewarded for sticking to it i powered through some additional dancing and singing and eased into the plot which really focuses on two people who are working hard to improve their financial lives ill avoid any spoilers so this wont go into much detail about the movie specificsseveral times throughout the film they pointed to how the costars each had big dreams and wanted to make their dreams come true they lived uncomfortable lives and several scenes such as a long stare into a old driedup roof leak on the ceiling silently illustrated how the great entrepreneur creator  unsatisfaction  helped drive them to make their dreams come trueso instead of the typical hollywood underlying theme of trying to break social molds the movie really focuses on the american dream and the difficulties and heartache that comes from pursuing your dreams the two characters push each other to continue even after having constant disappointmentseach star is faced with hardship when wanting to do things their own way and each had to make decisions that might cause them to lose their dreams the reason the movie was such a great movie is that each of us face the same dilemma along with the search to do our dreams with someone we respect and care forso i highly recommend this movie and will forewarn you that you have to power through the cotton candy beginning to get into the fine dining that develops midway through and launches you into a fantastic and powerful ending all i will say about the ending is that a mesmerizing stare and a few notes on a piano get expanded into amazing and powerful movie making congrats to everyone who made the movie possible,happy
the first time i saw this movie was before my resolution to write reviews on all theater movies but i just saw it for a second time which was a very good choice being able to watch and enjoy twice added because i was able to not only appreciate the story but see a lot of the technical side too this movie is a perfect romance the story of not just two people falling in love but two people falling in love with their craft ryan gosling loves jazz and wants to open a jazz bar and emma stone loves acting and aspires to be an actress the movie follows them through the changing seasons of a year as their relationship develops and they strive for their goals oh and there is singingi think what changed for me upon second viewing was that i did not enjoy emma as much as the first time she is a fine actor but some of her mannerisms threw me especially her singing goslings singing wasnt fantastic either but i like that both of them are just being real with their voices and arent some famous singer like the cameos by john legend that i still didnt like even on the first viewing what changed in a good way was that again the technical aspect was amazing the camera work and coloring along with the directing and cinematography were all spot on i found myself many times marveling at a certain shot or way that the camera follows people around a busy highway or crowded room as with before my favorite part is the ending flashback of what could have been that is so clever and enjoyable i would be fine just watching that part there is one final glare that i would like to address and that is the theme of this movie it has already won massive awards including all seven of its nominations at the golden globes and will no doubt be represented at the oscars this is a movie by hollywood for hollywood about hollywood and i dont like that at all to me it feels like a cop out any film maker knows that if they make a good movie about hollywood that hollywood will eat it up and give it every accolade that it can give and is no exception it angers me because in a year with movies like arrival moonlight and manchester by the sea i have a bad feeling that will dominate oscars as well just because it is a movie about hollywood and the voters are all hollywood hopefully i am wrong but throughout the entire movie there is that lingering wink towards hollywood and actors and actresses that this movie is for them which is unnecessary because every movie they make is for them they dont need extra praise,happy
this movie is the reason why i havent been to the cinema for two months how will any other movie make me feel any good when i have watched this masterpiece frankly it is such a good filmmaking and the directing the picture the photography everything is beautiful the songs are so well written and even if youre not into jazz youll get after watching chazelle is a genius it reminded me of good old musicals such movies are the reason why people need to go to the cinemas often i loved itand without giving any spoilers i want to say that the ending is the reason why its the best film that ive seen stone and gosling need congratulations for playing these roles so magically they gave me so many feelings chazelle needs to rock oscars this year you will dig into so deep feelings you will feel it you will feel why this is the best movie of the last decadego and watch it you wont regret it i bet on it,happy
i never liked musicals but trust me  this one made me change my mind everything is just so magical ryan gosling and emma stones chemistry is a treat to watchjust so mesmerizing making the audience to believe that fairy tales do existbut then life happens each becomes preoccupied in achieving their dreams the movie clearly depicts the fact that you have to make some heart breaking sacrifices to make your dreams come truei hope emma  ryan will win an oscar for their terrific performances i would like to tell the audience who wants to watch this movie after reading amazing reviews just do remember its a musical,happy

ryan gosling and emma stone worked together on crazy stupid love but that was five six years ago here they dazzle the silver screen with energy and charisma as mia and sebastian in the new film musical this movie from start to finish is one of the most entertaining escapist films of 2016 the actress mia and the jazz pianist sebastian are characters that we could try to love one of my favorite scenes is when mia and sebastian dive into dancing through the halls of the griffith observatory sebastian wants to get a jazz club going mia wants to quit the coffee shop and write plays the ending is a dream sequence thats very well connected with the way they feel about each other is a homage to all great movie musicals of hollywoods past but damien chazelle chooses jazz as his theme i give la land a 10 out of 10,happy
dont get me wrong i really liked this movie but its not as brilliant as its been hyped im not a big fan of musicals just wanted to see the results from ryan gosling teaching himself to play improvisational jazz piano and i wasnt disappointed he was brilliant so brilliant that they didnt give him enough material to do his skills justice i mean how many times can you play city of stars jeez louise give it a rest will ya i was getting sick of hearing it and i love that song i didnt care to compare this to 60 year old musicals but i do remember them having more than one hit song like singing in the rain and west side story even camelot has a treasure trove of memorable songs if not hits oh and dont forget the sound of music did i say i wasnt a big fan of musicals ok i kinda miss their innocent charm set design ambiance and poetic improvisational expressionism through dance and songtouches upon these attributes with gorgeous photography but it becomes pretty obvious the filmmakers were paying homage to musicals of decades past that it seemed to overshadow the motivation of the actors in how they were telling a more modernized story about following ones dreams no matter the cost pretty clichd plot but thats what most musicals were built on anyway keep it simplei did like the naturally relaxed delivery of ryan and emmas dancing and singing frankly emmas facial emoting on screen was more believable and gut wrenching than barbara streisands funny girl or any other actor in a musical for that matter and emma can really belt it out with the best of themand ryans singing style reminded me of the velvet fog mel torme just wanted to hear more of his jazz improvisational piano that shines in the christmas holiday scene in the restaurant it was amazing,happy
damien chazelle dazzled with whiplash 2014 pace acting music struggle and storytelling sure hit he had toyed with the musical idea when at harvard with low budget and black  white guy and madeline on a park bench 2009 he now delivers beyond any expectationsan oscartying record of 14 nominations and rave reviews if just a reflection of how good this is more than all that this movie is a collection of transporting feelings freedom love passion infatuation nostalgia it explores dreams hopes fears sacrifices and reality it has gorgeous and appropriate fantastic elements that add layers instead of detract from the story like titanic 1997 although a different beast all together i cried i laughed i smiled and was transportedryan gosling and especially emma stone sell ever detail with their extraordinary skills and dedication they are often spellbinding an onscreen chemistry and crafted from an assured writing and directing vision that take us places movies have never taken us before the best musical since moulin rouge 2001 fifteen years ago with added cool choreography and gusto cold fish 2010 was the last movie that blew my mind in such a graphic edge of the seat emotional artistic fantastic and physical way it also had a theme of planetarium and stars i am so glad i saw this in theatres too and in imax with incredible image and sound talking about sound and music justin hurwitz gets 3 oscar nods for his score and two songs quirky city of stars and adorable audition the fools who dream audition is a tour de force visual and visceral scene from stone and bittersweet song hurtitz should come home with one or likely two statuettes after been looked over in whiplash 2014 the jazz in both films is magical but here there are other elements of music even to the choice of 80s pop music in the mix and there is the explanation of jazz origins and essence that enhances the music as art and is contrasted with john legend radiofriendly recordselling reality which books tours and pays billssharp csharp chazelle deserves his two oscars but has though competition in both writing and directing including the return of writerdirector kenneth lonergan after barraising you can count on me 2000 and margaret 2011 canadian denis villeneuves arrival 2016 which is nominated for 8 oscars and 9 baftas is also a contender although not my personal favourite film of histhe only assured oscar win would be tom cross for editing who won for whiplash 2014 and put every beautiful detail of damien in a dizzying and delicate succession but i predict could sweep the oscars i guess it could get from 1013 oscars potentially beating the 11 wins treeway tie of epic benhur 1959 titanic 1997 and the lord of the rings the return of the king 2003 it won 7 out of 7 golden globes and should win a fair share of its 11 bafta awards nominations this sunday wishing it long life and success hard to beat something that steals your breath and hard beat for 2 hours like thisnot just a movie experience a revelation rejoice live love sing and dancela hollywood  is the best hollywood film of the decade or maybe the millennium,happy
i absolutely adored this movie you should actually listen to the hype its very well put together with a good script the acting is flawless and the whole movie gives you a feel good feeling from start to finish it had a smile on my face i dont understand why theres so many people giving bad reviews because this movie is a real gem and shows the sparkle glitz and glam of la and brings you back to earth with las underbelly the struggles to achieve the dream if you have to see a movie it must be it wont disappoint and if you dont like it then you must i dont know have no taste i presume and need a check up or need to be educated there really isnt another movie like this it isnt only a delightful movie it is beautiful as well,happy
i cried nonstop on the inside for the first 37minutes of this movie and then i walked out and i cried more when i got home but then i stopped crying and then i remembered how bad the movie was and i started to cry a little more on the drive home and i will probably cry a little more on my way to work tomorrow just remembering what i went through for those 37minutes but all in all it was a very good movie i recommend it to everyone it was a great movie if youre having a great day just go and watch this movie and just ruin your night i know i didps i cried while writing this post,happy
finally i got to see and finally i understood what all the fuss was about im not much into romantic films and so i had my doubts about it i couldnt be more wrong i dont know if its the best film of 2016 i still have a lot to watch but it certainly is one of the most amazing and memorable cinematic experiences of the yearwritten and directed by damien chazelle follows mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling as theyre both trying to fulfill their ambitious dreams in the city of los angeles mia currently working in a coffee shop wants to become a famous actress while sebastian dreams of revitalizing the jazz scene by creating his own jazz club they fall in love with each other and together try to achieve their goals for a while everything seems perfect but the challenges they face test their faith in both their relationship and their visionsthe film has won a recordbreaking 7 golden globe awards and received a recordtying 14 academy awards nominations surely you cant always trust the academy on deciding which is the best picture of the year but this many accolades cannot be overlooked so what is it that makes so special well first of all it is technically flawless cinematography editing costumes and acting are topnotch emma stone is one of my favourite actresses and she is absolutely dazzling however two other things are what make the film stand outthe first is the music the score of justin hurwitz who also composed the music for damien chazelles two previous features is utterly enchanting hurwitz also wrote most of the songs with two of those being nominated for an oscar it really felt that the songs were woven together like every song was just another verse of a bigger song the second thing was its thoughtprovoking ending im not going to spoil it i just want to say that i spend days trying to figure out what it meant and what message was the film trying to transmit to the audience it came out unexpectedly to distinguish the film from the average romance film that satisfying as it may be for teenage girls lacks any significant substance for these reasons i believe will be remembered for years and years to come and i wouldnt be surprised if it broke the academy awards record overall an unforgettable masterpiecemore reviews on httpsreflectingoncinemablogwordpresscom,happy
film buffs and critics always talk about a film bringing something new to its genre this is why we look down upon clich and repetitive plots  we want something new and interesting and this movie ladies and gentlemen was exactly what we are always on about is utterly incredible at times it seems almost experimental  the unique and unusual angles plot devices and shots that the director had the audacity to take had me leaning forward in my seat in complete disbelief at what i was seeing emma stone and ryan goslings chemistry was just incredible and the ending was truly heartbreaking it was moments such as the tap dance number in the middle of the street the shared flashback at the films conclusion and the amazing floating dance scene that made this film what it was  different something never seen before and something utterly incredible in my mind it deserves every single one of the 14 nominations it has received my only minuscule criticism is that perhaps the songs were not quite memorable enough a few of them have already slipped my mind  but the better songs were on the contrary fantastic and beautiful this film is just incredible a story told from a unique and imaginative perspective and one told with such passion and creativity that it stands out in my mind as perhaps one of the most filmically creative pieces of all time,happy
la land is a film that was made by the passion for movies and evokes the same love to the public damien chazelles dream project is replete with gender references all perfectly incorporated ranging from a narrative structure to a simple touch on a post here is the heart who leads the story the direction of chazelle is creative and daring giving preference to long plans the mise en scene is vivid and the camera is active always looking to float around the scene and characters and the dance and music scenes are impeccablebut the soul of the film is in ryan gosling and emma stone gosling has an extremely dedicated work including the piano he injects different layers to the character transiting very well between drama comedy romance and sarcasm and that leaves the public fallen in love with sebastian and stone probably the most wonderful thing in this lovely movie creates a vibrant mia a performance with explosions of feelings and that exceeds the limits of the screen and reaches the heart of the viewer in full leaving us with each new frame more and more in love with it the rest of the cast acts correctly but without individual highlights the technical part is perfect the cinematography is inventive and printing technicolors dreamcolors and presented in cinemascope makes the film an event the vast costumes and the detailed production design help create an intense fluid and euphoric world and the soundtrack and the songs which could be more are incredible they are remarkable compositions that help to punctuate the emotions of the scenes and that help to extract excellent moments of the protagoniststhe few problems of the film like the abandonment of some elements that were interesting and abrupt changes of feelings do not change the fact that la tierra is a masterpiece a masterful harmonious exciting brave and daring film with captures the essence of what it truly is to fall in love with the movies a movie for a lifetime,happy
i didnt see top reviews coming from laymen when it comes to musicals the too praising come off as insincere or pretentious while the too critical feel snobbish and honestly a little psychopathic  it does a fantastic job of letting the viewer take away the meaning of the relationship based on your own personal experiences if youre jaded like myself then be prepared to open old wounds the ending felt as if i was being talked to directly and held my hand down a dark tunnel of thought where i was forced to evaluate decisions and there unfortunate consequences its a little ironic how its being judged harshly when it comes to plays since ryan goslings character is them and harbors same feelings but with jazz instead but hey i am young and dumb so what do i know,happy
let me start out by saying i loved this movie it didnt pretend to be anything it wasnt it was just fun something i usually look for in a movie the problem is the critics of this movie are trying to shoehorn it into categories it has no business being in trying to force it into being something its not well then what is it in order to answer that question we must first answer the question of what it is not 1 its not a copycat 1950s musical i will admit i loved some of the throwbacks to the old timey musicals of the glory days of hollywood singing in the rain is probably my all time favorite movie so seeing pay homage to it as well as some other classics certainly made me happy but thats all it was an homage this movie certainly had the feel of the iconic 50s musical but its not its a modern adaptation of those musicals one which allows us to see the flaws in the 50s musical way of looking at lifecomparing this film to others will not allow you to see it for what it truly is a gem in and of itself  2 its not a mind bender while there are definitely lessons and messages to be taken from this movie reading to much into it causes you to lose sight of what it truly is while theres certainly a place for the mind blowing soul searching storytelling that we see in movies like inception and schindlers list theres also a place for a story that just allows you to enjoy yourself to laugh maybe cry a little to sit back and sing along as you allow yourself to have a good time so weve established what its not what it doesnt need to be compared to so then what is 1 its a reversal of the traditional hollywood stereotypes you know the kind the aforementioned 50s musicals are famous for them although there are countless other examples throughout cinematic history boy with dreams meets girl with dreams love gets in the way of dreams love finds a way to overcome all odds guy and girl both get to live our dreams with the love of their lives and ride off into the sunset together roll credits how many movies do you know that fit that storyline because i can think of about a dozen off the top of my head thats not how real life works ladies and gentlemen i hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you want to fulfill your dreams or if you want to have a classic hollywood romance youre going to have to make sacrifices likely youre going to have to choose one over the other this film does what ive seen no other do it allows the characters to make those sacrifices to separate amicably and still be happy they dont regret their decisions they are happy even though they wish they didnt have to make those sacrifices through the traditional hollywood ending that it montages at the end you see how the musicals of old would have ended this film what it could be and then you see what is the reality of the struggles of being a musician of being an actress its hard it takes sacrifice and it allows the audience to see the effects of that sacrifice2 the music parallels whats happening in the story and continues the reversing of hollywood stereotypes a lovely night is essentially the polar opposite of every hollywood meeting and its exactly what happens in real life they know they like each other we know they like each other but theyre not about to admit it to the other one in fact theyre going to sing for 2 minutes about how they dont like each other and start a fire is essentially the hollywood version of love like the music that they want sebastian to play start a fire is a representation of what hollywood pretends romance to be dumbed down for the masses all passion and no substance likewise the fools who dream glamorized the appeal of a career in hollywood its all about the perks and nothing about the hard labor and the sacrifices  perfectly placed and expertly written the soundtrack is an excellent contrast to what a traditional hollywood film would have done with this storyline it allows you to see what hollywood would have done with it while at the same time turning the whole notion on its head with the story itself 3 it allows you to have fun as i said this movie can be sad particularly at the end and yet its thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish it doesnt pretend to be anything it isnt its sappy its cheesy the actors arent the best singers or dancers so what its fun it made me laugh it made me cry it made me go out and buy the soundtrack for goodness sakes something i rarely ever do its just fun and it proves that movies dont have to be any more than that so let the critics rail on this movie let them say its overrated i still maintain that theyre trying to make it into something it was never meant to be and i firmly believe that if you see it for what it is you will enjoy it just as much as i did say what you want but i will be belting out every word to the fools who dream in my car for years to come,happy
sebastian and a ryan gosling and emma stone two young people fall in love and try to balance between their relationship and their dreamswith their unique interpretations to transfer to another era a music and dance masterpiece with touches of contemporary reality and a fee though is not the ideal happy ending manages to make the viewer to smile and to leave cinema room pleased with what you saw as a whole and to get the message that all dreams can be made and some even enjoy it  even if that someone was the love of your life a colorful and vibrant musical that takes place in los angeles of today and that captures the pain and pleasure of the pursuit of dreams a musical storyline from the good old hollywood dedicated to those who love cinema and those who still dream of ,happy
is a masterpiece it is a declaration of love to cinema art music poetry it is a lifestory of los angeles a story of dreams and disappointments with a strong moral regarding the subject of dream believe fight for it chazelle confirms himself as one of the greatest directors of these days improving his skills from his last work whiplash hes great emma stone is incredible she has been perfect in everything shes a huge actress i personally love her since birdman she is the movie and the movie goes on thanks to her beautiful talented seductive ryan gosling is really appropriated for his role i considered him as a kind of singlemansupportingcast for emma whom i consider the only true protagonist of the movie and he has been really goodsongs are astonishing involvingi really loved that waiting for the dvd to be available,happy
amazing movie a new way of making musicals that even people that dont like these type of movies comes out surprise after seen it emma stone made a excellent job even though she had a hard time learning the dancing parts a must see movie of this century the musics in the soundtrack are amazing all of them especially the city of stars a lovely night and the audition one the fact that damien chazelle brought back the importance of the jazz and how it has been forgotten through generations brings back the beauty of it into a generation of people definitely the best picture nominated in this years oscar a picture of the real world and the difficult of pursuing your dreams the rough path to make it and the big what if that make us think in the things that are throw in our way and that changes our journey,happy
every single scene in this movie is perfect on almost every level no other musical has integrated this good music scenes into the plot this seamlessly before much of it comes down to great performances by ryan gosling and emma stone obviously music is fantastic the acting is incredible but the message and ending of this movie is by far the best the best ending of a movie ive ever seen and it could not be more mature and original this movie deserves many oscars and im glad its been nominated for a bunch i recommend this movie to anyone it is a movie that will be remembered for a long long time 1010 easily,happy
good music good cinematography good choreography good acting what can i say that hasnt been said already i think this is one of the better modern musicals and im not a big fan of the genre the way this movie is done is what really makes it good there are many excellent long scenes someone will start dancing and the entire lighting of the set will change and the camera will move into closeup to medium to panorama and to closeup again in the same take thats pretty impressivei enjoyed the visuals the blue and purple night skies are stunning and they did a good job with the timing so you could get those nice skies in the background one of the best things about it is how the characters describe jazz music that was very well written you understand perfectly why jazz can mean so much to someone theres a portion in the movie that drags a bit and loses some pace and there were some moments i thought were repetitive but otherwise i had a good time with it theres good comedy here too and i thought the mix of classic and modern cinema made this movie pretty greati get why this has gotten so many awards and it will deserve some of them but i do think silence could have gotten at least one more nomination,happy
is a story of what goes everyday in people who wants to fulfill their dreams in show business what is the core of los angeles for the ones who works on the movies business surely have a special meaning and most will identify them selves in at least one part of it the movie is getting better and better thru it and it ends in a spectacular way when it finishes you keep it in your memory for a long time making a musical nowadays is a huge risk but it works very well here the music is great and some of the songs will be classics the actors did a great job even john legend nothing spectacular just clean performances given what it need it it would be a classic for the future well done,happy
this film is sublime the way its shot the acting the score the dancing the plot its a classic film in the mould of singin in the rain but set in the present day with the same concerns its a love story with a realistic ending the message you come away with is follow your dreams without it feeling too saccharine i have not been that affected by a film in years which is why i chose to write a review as i never write on here this film has been given a lot of hype and is bound to win several awards but in this case they are very much deserved its a such a wellmade film on every front cant fault it dont listen to some of miserable reviewers like the one on the main page,happy
i have never written a review before on imdb but i have to say a couple of things about this filmit wasnt all about love it was also about life itself it was so real there was sadness and happiness at the same time the film was so colourful but it wasnt girly at all it wast like the other clichhollywood films the soundtrack the casting the costumes were all great i watched ryan gosling and emma stone together in crazystupid love and gangster squad too but these two films were not that stunning maybe the scenario wasnt good enough but their roles in were perfect for them thats why they both are nominated for best actor and best actress oscars,happy
the perfect amalgamation of hollywood past and present the slow transition from the wistful allure of dreams to the tangible pop of reality the music and the songs are instant classic by the second viewing it felt like coming home they fit so snugly and felt so rightwhats equally amazing is the character work the remolding of archetypes how neither is an answer so much as a piece of a bigger puzzle sebs passion and devotion are his own undoing he gets what he wants but he also is let down in nearly every other facet of his life he doesnt save jazz john legends keith saves jazz or at least starts to and gets the best speech in the film when he tells seb that hes too traditional and that jazz is about the future but thats because seb is selfish and he only cares about what he wants at least insofar as it pertains to his dreams he changes for mia but also realizes he has to let her go ironically this unselfish act leaves him alone his passion which we normally prize so much in films like this doesnt make him big or famous but instead leaves him small and alone his type the classic bold and passionate man with a dream who cant be stopped type isnt real but as an example to others it does much like a good musical on our lives more on that in a bitmia in her empathy grace and selflessness attains her dream and makes a family yet she doesnt have the person who helped her achieve all this she tells seb that his passion will become other peoples if he believes in it enough but its his passion for pursuing a dream that affects her and causes her to write her play and sing a song and nail her audition her sensitivity is what makes her strong a conduit for passions on screen and offwhat this movie could be suggesting much like whiplashs carefully constructed ideology about the costs and sacrifices of pursuing a dream is that everyone needs a push a push in the direction that you may not be capable of on your own mia developing a backbone believing in herself because seb does seb dropping his stubbornness and pride so that he can make money playing for a real gig so that he can open his club later and that this is in effect the true beauty and romance of our lives what the epilogue suggests is not what could have been so much as what could never be life is a beautiful breathtaking musical of love and passion and romance and adventure even if it doesnt end up how you think and doesnt follow a tightly scripted path if you spend too much time worrying about why your life isnt a hollywood fairy tale romance you will miss out on the musicality and the truth of the present classic musicals are a state of mind not a state of being,happy
i did like this movie all the hype made by the oscars nominations made me want to watch itthe problem with all the hate we see here giving 1s like this is the worst movie ever made is that people went to see it as another romantic musical 60s whatever its none of that it is a movie with a story and in the middle some people dance and singits a nostalgic look at our past why we did it and whom we should say thanks for being there for us but we dont because the present is our lifegreat jazz for people that like it im no fan and a great story of dreams being the pursued in la landif you dont go waiting for a classical you will like this movie,happy
before watching this movie i know that this movie is gonna be good because ive hear ed a lot of good reviews and ratings on this movie and also i love musical movies and broadway all i can say on this movie that it was fantastic one of the things i love on this movie is the story telling the way they tell the story especially that ending probably one of the best ending ive seen on a movie or any videos ive seen the songs definitely fits the movie i feel like on the first minutes of the movie they sing too much song but as the movie goes by i feel like is the right thing i love the costume that they use it definitely fits the movie also ryan gosling ive noticed that ryan gosling used the same shoes or maybe im wrong also the lighting fits on the movie ryan gosling is probably one of the best things on the movie the way he carrys his character is so natural especially his singing and piano skills gold also emma stone is good awesome performance john legend character feels like just a cameo but still goodsome minor things that i dont like on the movie is the transition on scene to scene i feel like its a little bit fast especially on the summer time the transition looks like awkward the way emma stone said that she hate jazz feels kinda force and the transition to the endingso thats my take on the movie its definitely must see movie probably one of the best movie ive because i love musicals i will not be surprise if this movie dominated oscar because its really good i will give this movie a 910,happy
touching movie most of us can relate to beautiful music and editing acting done superblyscript is the soul of movieas soon as we think everything is all good as happens in movies script brings us to the ground realitybitter truth of our life we start dreaming liking attached to some one their life and then suddenly everything stopsnever comes back to the way it was then time passes and most of us move on and think that yes we moved on but is it true treat to watch the movie a musical journey with love struggle success wowmust watch,happy
as a huge fan of classic cinema this movie did nothing else to me than remind me why i love this art form so much the cast was superb the chemistry between gosling and stone was great the music was beautifully composed so many tunes that are going to stick in my head for a long time and the story is quite beautiful and simplethe film making is superb the work between the director and cinematographer is admirable they brought back a shooting style that i dont see fairly often these days they let the actors create the emotion and the camera is just there to enhance itjust watch it trust me you wont regret it,happy
ive come to realize that current award season paranoia is more detrimental to the film industry than beneficial whether lobby riddled or tailor made the very release calendar is designed to make the biggest splash for award recognition rather than allowing every film every topic and every discussion to have room to exist and grow or notis one such example of a film that gathered momentum from its early premiere and rapturous reviews in venice until a disproportionate attention worldwide  not undeserving it is every bit justified but because the attention was given for all the wrong reasons musicals are not an easy sell by definition progressivists may consider it is way past its sellby date and purists may consider the latest outings as travesties or lacking the charm of the classicsnews flash proves exactly the opposite it is an unambitious unpretentious anachronistic love letter to old musicals jazz los angeles and love stories it is a hard sell and specially not a product for everyone just because marketing momentum rubs a film in your face it doesnt mean it is for you an essential characteristic of being a film lover is understanding that every film finds its audience and not the other way around and while some films appeal to a wider audience it doesnt mean that every film that sweeps individual award recognition amounting to a considerable number has to appeal to all is a film that haters love to hate not and for years to come for those who dont deliberately walk into it with either cynical or preconceived disposition to destroy it youll find a heartwarming ode to a dying art musicals or jazz alike never mind thinly plotted or with a sparsely uneven pace that will pull you to a carefree make belief alternate world isnt it the point of the genre anyway,happy
career and aspirations have higher priority than love that is how most of the millennial think drive to achieve dreams takes over anything and everything in life in the process of doing so important people helping you succeed are left behind only when you reflect back after achieving success you feel the void left your lifesomething similar happens with mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling she wants to become an actress and he wants to revive jazz by opening his own bar that plays jazz sebastian to earn livelihood and to save enough money starts playing in a band mia doesnt like that as she thinks that he is living a false life at the same time she is losing all hopes of making it as an actress sebastian for his empathetic nature and love for mia makes sure that she takes her last chance at the making as an actressto make it big in their lives they move on separate paths and at the end of the movie their paths intersect where both had achieved their dreams pain can be seen in eyes of both as both had made it big but without each other and it is evident that has left a big void in their hearts the end of the movie brings you back to reality and makes you think twice whether there are ways to achieve your dreams by still being with the love of your life for few who have experienced some thing similar end of the movie is an emotional ride i personally liked the movie for its music all the love and bite of realityemma stone will surely get oscar for her performance ryan gosling better luck next time,happy
there is so much to say about this movie musical even without giving anything away just looking at my after notes its already loaded with comments and details telling me this is going to be a larger than normal post possibly exceeding the imdb word count of a thousand lets see damien chazelle does it again firstly where he bashed my head in with a drumstick or two with 2014s whiplash which was so intense it had me sweating in the cinema twice i had to watch it again the very next day and wasnt any less sweaty the second time round an absolute masterpiece chazelle again displays his absolutely stunning visual brilliance whilst tilting the hat to classic cinema and musicals like casablanca funny face and the red balloon having been to la countless of times i find it to be my less favourite of the american cities ive been to but chazelle manages to add a glossy vibrant veil over the top thats inspired me with a new appreciation for the city i still find it incredible and slightly unbelievable but in a good way that hes managed to take a modern bustling and dirty city and still make it feel retro and vintage using abstract cinematography like creating its very own time zone altogether he even opens using the original 20th century fox logo and the fade out focuses make you feel like youre watching a theatre play theres a long list of scenes that stay with you because of this style and of course being a musical chazelle honours the classic musical methods with astonishing and exuberant long takes that makes your smile stretch from seat 1 to 20 the opening scene alone is a tremendous feat with epic cinematography and beautiful imagery i could dissect the whole movie recounting each joyful and pleasant scene by scene but its truly something that has to be marvelled at by seeing and not reading the story is about a turbulent romance between seb ryan gosling a confident proud and passionate pianist those ambitions sits with having his very own jazz club and mia emma stone a struggling aspiring actress trying to make her way in the superficial hollywood the cars they drive is a sweet analogy of their characters in way seb driving a classic 82 buick riviera and mia driving a prius it must be familiar ground for both playing aspiring performing artists such as they are in real life apparently the auditioning scenes which are torturous were drawn from both stars actually experiences in auditioning the chemistry between the two is as always perfect this being their third outing after gangster squad and stupid crazy love gosling oozes a certain coolness but with quite the finazz of confident arrogance whilst stone appears vulnerable reserved and bashful but whats simmering is an audacious creative and inspiring woman its so well balanced and enriched by both you could be forgiven for forgetting john legend is in the movie chazelle and hurwitz love of jazz shines through just like it did with whiplash now i know i keep referencing whiplash but please note these are two very different films which make this all the more impressive its the similarities such as the music being very much a subject matter to both films im no expert but im a lover of jazz too and this soundtrack itself is utterly amazing infectious and makes the heart glow with instantly recognisable tracks like someone in the crowd city of stars and a lovely night justin hurwitz composes a mesmerising enchanting musical that reminds me of sitting in ronnie scotts and has me weaving in and out of traffic whilst listening to the songs in the car gosling and stone perform the songs and dances excellently displaying a gracefulness that would make any nonmusical fan a lover and a dancer the choreography is majestic throughout especially the two scenes at griffin parkobservatory the tap dancing in particular gosling actually learning to play the piano for his parts entirely says a lot about him as a star and as an actor getting the emotion to come through the whole production is flawless and as ive said before this zesty imagery is made up dazzling costume designs great atmospheric sets and masterful use of lighting the dresses mia wears set against the plots shes on is just eyecandy and sebs shoes i want a pair of those shoes have you ever watched a film and thought it was a personally message to you sent from the cosmos whether it be a dig or a reminder the conclusion certainly hit a few chords on my heartstrings bringing a tear to my eye its the perfect ending to a glorious movie its only shame is not having enough song and dance but it a good thing to leave wanting more and the film already has a runtime of 128mins as always i havent read any reviews but from what i can gather from the quotable taglines they are awarding the film with theyre absolutely right it really is what everyone is saying a dazzling delightful masterpiece thats amazingly good for the soul heartfelt and a prefect blend of modern and vintage style being nominated for 14 oscars 11 bafta awards and won 7 golden globes should speaks volumes i was totally swept off my feet and urge everyone to watch this film at least twice running time 9 the cast 10 performance 9 direction 10 story 10 script 10 creativity 10 soundtrack 10 job description 10 the extra bonus points 1098 910,happy
the movie is great it shows perfectly how a couple a young aspiring lady and man want to do something in life which is ignorant by people in this real world and their passion gets ignored again and again the love affection and the support to each other shown in the movie is so amazing and displayed on the screen brilliantly and yeah at the last as displayed in the movie the fallgenerally we find someone in life with whom our hearts and soul stay connected but we dont meet or stay together its just love and respect for the person and yeah life is unpredictable you may love your husband or wife but there is someone out there made for you and if you got that person with you married and together then you are the most lucky one feel blessed,happy
the first half and last scene of this film are simply outrageously gorgeous amazing music clapyourhandswithdelightdancing with quite the cast it brings tears to your eyes goosebumps to the back of your neck and a nostalgia even this 26yearold can appreciate the middle thirdhalf of the film brings the modern twist to this film it shows the audience that the optimism of youth sometimes has to give way to practicalities of life that sometimes means that you might have to cashin to fulfil the dreams of your younger self this i think is a great narrative to live by especially for the generations after mine who seek fame for fames sake rather than attempting to be the best at something first now i know some people say that there is a lot of mansplaining in this film thats for other people to decide since im a white male i cant really comment on that another criticism that i had was the opening scene  as brilliant as it was  needed morewow factor its the opening of a musical you can ramp up the volume make things brighter and happier whilst it is amazing and aweinspiring you were straining to hear what was being said and  after the hype of this scene  you felt a bitmehanother criticism has been the last scene personally i loved it its a classic what could have been that everyone feels at some point in their life the idealised view that life could have been happier and racier however they have gotten to where they want to be and would they have managed that whilst being together who knowsas the title says this movie is a love song to classic hollywood whilst poking fun at itself and having a liberal sprinkling of modern touches i loved it though i do acknowledge the criticisms some of which i accept some i dont quite buy,happy
this movie is so sweet that its almost impossible to criticize with that said i felt that the music fell well below the standards of the rest of the elements of the film even when simply lumped with other film scores doesnt rate very high and alongside musicals it fares rather poorly there is nothing approaching a showstopper and the background score is repetitive and facile yet these musical weaklings are meant to propel us through long swaths of the narrative i would say the same thing about the dancing its cute but not compelling enough to fill a scene perhaps at 2 two hours and eight minutes they were being overlyambitiousat their best the song numbers were pastiches of irving berlin the thing is if you cant write a song half as good as cheek to cheek then just steal a songthis reminded so much of el otro lado de la cama 2002 by emilio martnezlzaro and written by david serrano although the spanish film lacked the productions values of the idea was cute enough and she seems like a nice enough kid but emma stone really doesnt have what it takes to pull off an old fashioned solo shot in closeup who does really and once again the song just wasnt remarkable on any level the idea was cute enoughthe seven note phase of the theme songas well as the rest of itjust didnt cut it for me and by the final scene i was completely sick of it and no one would have clapped at the end of his lame piano recitalpeople who like jazz know good music there was some memorable dialogue that was fighting in a higher weight class than the music hollywood worships everything but respects nothing the story was as predictable as anyone wouldcould imagine boy meets girl the share their dreams and fall in love dreams dont go according to plan boy says nasty things to girl et cetera i didnt expect much more but i expected just a tiny bit more their break up scene was maudlin and derivativeat bestand on top of that he burned dinnerthe photography was wonderful at every step and the los angeles chamber of commerce must be positively thrilled the city has never looked better in any film that i have ever seenso when i have so many problems big problems with a film why would i give it eight stars i have at least as many reasons to love the movie as i have criticisms first of all as i stated above it is super sweet any movie that doesnt give a starring role to a gun is ok in my book the next important thing is that i love jazz,happy
i had heard so much about this film that i knew i had to see it and i have now seen as i really really love this film the premise of this film sees a jazz pianist fall in love with a failing actress and we see there journey ryan gosling plays sebastian the jazz pianist and he is fantastic in this film he just has so much charisma in this film and you see him as the coolest guy in any film he has such a passion for jazz that you want to see him succeed and you buy him as a character emma stone plays mia the failing actress and she is truly great in this film she is incredibly relatable and like gosling you want to see her succeed in her dreams and you really care about her character gosling and stones chemistry is what really carries this movie and i ended up caring about there relationship as the film progresses and develops however my one negative in this film is the fact there is a supporting cast in this film that is just there to sing and dance which i thought could have been used in a better way there is a cameo in this film that i didnt know was coming so i am not going to spoil it in case you have missed it too but it was gratifying but it does make you wish this cameo was in this film allot more the story is a great journey of two people that have different passions but you see there relationship develop and you really care about how there relationship develops throughout there movie and how both characters own personal journey takes twists and turns that are great to watch the script has great dialogue that make these characters charming and relatable to anybody really but when the drama hits it also feels pretty real and you see the drama play out very well the style of this film is probably the most unique thing about this film this is a loveletter to musicals of old and it does it pretty well the songs are memorable and catchy and it does help the main characters characterization the dance moves are also great and helps make this an easy watch overall i liked this movie and then for the next few hours i was thinking about the film and i ended up loving it so even if you are not a fan of musicals this is worth a watch,happy
finally after waiting for this movie more than a month its come in hd thank god i didnt watch in cam watching movie in cam just you cant enjoy it at all but now this is available in hd really what a amazing and very very beautiful movie emma stone and ryan gosling is just so perfect doing their job what a movie love it ryan gosling whos playing a best jazz pianist role trying to save jazz music because its dying people is not listing it so he is try to saving and emma stone become a very famous actress and she just married to other man and have one baby and one day when she just came in that old place and listen too ryan playing that piano i thought here movie will gonna give a bad end but they just saw each other and there is friendship smile they give to each other awesome man that was just a awesome end and before end a whole movie just go with different perspective too when instead another man ryan married to emma thats also make movie a bit interesting i love that scene when they are talking with music saying same words but you know with a tone in a musical form that was awesome and also there is dance of ryan and emma so perfect each step not so long step but so perfect just a beautiful movie already won 7 golden globes and i am pretty sure will get couple of oscar too imdb 88 look at imdb rating very high,happy
to people who got out of the cinema 10 minutes after this started assuming it was a musical you have no idea what you lost i had a hard time understanding the amount of 1star ratings on a movie averaging a very good rating otherwise until i understood the shallow experience and judgment that lead to themthe musical is just for appearances and as it seems its very well done the movie is simply sensational  i rarely go to a movie and get up at 630 the next morning haunted by details and trying to find explanations and sensereally go to the cinema and get past the first 20 minutes you will be hooked10 stars from me well deserved,happy
im not the biggest musical fan but this movie absolutely blew me awayso i have 4 major reasons why i absolutely loved this to its core 1 this movie looks so visually flawless the cinematographer and director obviously understood each other perfectly in the making of this film each scene was breath taking to my eyes and even to the point of goosebumps for me the vision of the city during the night time was incredible and something i noticed which may be wrong but the constant slight nudges of stars throughout the whole movie was pretty awesome to me visually breath taking2 the characters were so well written that from the moment we are introduced to them i was curious and my curiosities were all satisfied within the limits of this film i felt myself growing with them and could even relate to them in many parts from ryan goslings obsession over his favorite thing in life to emma stones dreams of being an actress very relatable and extremely well acted by both gosling and stone3 i supported everything this movie stood for which was a loveencouragement letter to any dreamer in the world that are having a tough time making there dreams a realityand finally 4 the ending of this movie was absolutely perfect in every way though i say it is not exactly original it is exactly the ending that this movie needed to seal the deali love this movie cause it was perfect to me the movie itself had more impact on me then the musicality to it although i am also obsessed with the music currently any movie goer even if you do not like musicals should check this out because even you dont like the music the story is so brilliantly told and you will fall in love with the characters just go see it now,happy
im not a big fan of musicals this genre is probably my least favourite film type and consequently i was not looking forward to seeing this so this describes my initial attitude the film opens with a huge musical number the scene is set at an enormous traffic jam where the drivers begin singing and dancing on bonnets everyone eventually joins in my heart sank at this point because this is not what happens when youre stuck in a traffic jam not at least for me i didnt need to worry from there on the one third music blends very well with the two thirds standard dialoguestars ryan gosling a struggling jazz pianist and emma stone a struggling actress both actors characters have ambitions both are following their dreams both sing and dance ryan learns to play the jazz piano  both are extremely competent and they both have great chemistrythere are many memorable scenes and a reoccurring theme tune used to drive the narrative for instance emmas character doesnt like jazz so ryan takes her to a club and explains how to appreciate jazz and how he hears it  he says its all about conflict compromise always different and very very excitingthe film is very emotional the stars fall in love but their paths diverge and they eventually go their separate ways at its conclusion the film quickly plays through an alternate ending which is brave for hollywood to finish on anything less than sickly sweetif you like oldschool musicals then youll like this if you like jazz then youll like this film even if you dont appreciate jazz you might be encouraged to listen to some more after seeing this highly recommended,happy
so i loved the movie my wife hated it when we talked about it the chances the movie took worked for me and didnt for her while this may seem vague if you see the movie youll completely understand what im meaning i think not looking at the movie as a musical and more of just an experience because if youre looking for great singing this isnt it the flaws of the singers make it beautiful they arent out to be anything they arent and it also applies to their dancing this movie isnt for everyone but i feel like if you are the person it hits it hits hard the movie moves a bit slow but its the first time after a film where ive personally wanted to applaud i usually make fun of those people but i held it in,happy
its easy to see why this so popular with hollywood it about the hollywood dream  what better way to express that than in a musical ill be honest i love the genre  musicals dominate my top ten films of all time  they encompass pure escapism  romance  and put a smile on your face throughout and maybe the odd tear too  best of all you can watch them over and over again  how did this this perform as a musical  poorly to be honest  yes theres romance  yes theres escapism  but the smiles were sadly missing  undoubtedly youll fall in love with emma stone  ryan goslings performance however was substandard in comparison  you never really felt his character had true  i would die for you  passion for mia  i loved the homage to hollywood however  particularly the mash up of ricks bar in casablanca throughout  the whole premise of a musical is mad people dont generally break into song and dance in the street but when they do in this movie theyre able to do it tongue in cheek and with humour recognising how bizarre their actions are  i loved the use of spotlighting in musical sequences  just wish there were more musical numbers and maybe a few full cast dance numbers  the opening sequence gave you a feeling you were in for a traditional musical with a touch of mamma mia popularity but it never transpired  on the negative side the movie did try and tick too many boxes and could have benefited from better script editing and adhering to a true romantic story line but perhaps that was its aim  like the breakaway from traditional jazz theres an attempt to break away from the traditional musical  the overall theme was that fantasy is better than reality and this was enhanced by the closing scene  life is so much better in  there were a couple of musical numbers you wont be able to get out of your head  i liked the film  just wish i could have loved it  i ought to want to see it again but im not bothered and thats where it failed on the whole  heres to those who dream pada,happy
first and foremost dont get me wrong i really liked this movie i just didnt love it as much as many other people i went to a special event of this movie because i wanted to see it as soon as i could i heard the most wonderful things about it and it didnt really live up to the hype for methe movie is about two dreamers living in la chasing their career dreams emma stones character mia wants to become an actress and ryan goslings character sebastian wants to open his own jazz bar soon they fall in lovei have to say the movie looks breathtaking you can really feel that they live in la the spirit of the city of angels is tangible every part of this film is colorful and bright and sunny every shot is like a well composed painting the costumes and makeup is wonderful makes the movie feel a bit retro at first i thought the movie was set in the 50s but its present day but i didnt really mind because the characters themselves are quite nostalgicthe acting was amazing i loved the characters their chemistry felt really natural however i didnt really like their vocal talents actually apart from john legends of course the music was fine though not as great as i hoped it would be some of the songs bored me a little bit after a while the opening song was fantasticthe story was a bit up and down for me i loved the first part it also had the best songs and dance routines the second halve of the movie lagged a bit for me it was also somewhat predictable the characters didnt seem to develop much further i really relate to the theme of the movie i myself am an aspiring artist im a drawer and im trying to find my way in visual development and storyboarding for movies so i know what its like to hope for your big break and getting the door slammed in your face therefore at some points i wished they focused more on that and less on the romantic plot not because i dont like romantic movies i do but because the romantic plot wasnt really something new i have seen that movie many times the other storyline about young artist chasing their dreams in la was much more refreshing the ending didnt really do it for me it was as if they were doubting themselves as if they werent sure how to end itso yes like anyone will tell you this movie is great but dont expect too much like i did i thought this was going to be the best movie of the year for me and it wasnt if i hadnt heard about all the hype before i would have been pleasantly surprised but as it is it was just a good film go see it,happy
believe the hype with as this colourful creative and masterful musical deserves to sweep up at the upcoming oscar season just as it has at the golden globes despite such a simple story being told it features so much heart invigorated energy and euphoria that you simply cannot stop smiling with this film even when it all ends a little melancholy its refreshing stunningly told visually captivating and heartfelt in its exploration of themes and ideas with two sensational performances at its core its certainly sweet but with a little bitter bite too refusing to indulge too much in tripes and clichs and keeping the ball rolling even through the slower moments there is always something to enjoy i implore you to watch this if only to be able to tell the story to future generations about where you watched 2017s best picture winner which is destined to become a classic in years to come its a musical masterpiece a love letter to a hollywood time gone by and everything i love about film just in a slightly different package and a reminder to let the dreamer inside of us all to dreamfull review  googltvo4ze,happy
mia played by emma stone is an aspiring actress working in a coffee shop she gets auditions but nothing has come of these sebastian ryan gosling is a struggling jazz pianist playing small venues his dream is to open his own jazz club the two meet but dont hit it off over time however things changei generally dislike musicals and romantic dramas romantic dramas tend to be incredibly formulaic schmaltzy and unrealistic musicals are irritating because instead of spoken dialogue you have someone singing words at you and it all seems so contrived and out of place thus is if youre lucky many musicals just use music as paddingso it is with some trepidation that i watched the opening few scenes didnt help my fear that this was going to be a campy west side storylike implausible songanddance fest or a les miserableslike constant stream of nailsonblackboard irritationhowever it soon became clear that is better than that the answer to how much better increases the more into the movie you getwhat sustains the movie initially is its warmth the wonderful oftenfunny dialogue and the interaction between the two main characters the chemistry between emma stone and ryan gosling is fantastic and their performances especially emma stones alone are worth the price of admissioneven the music is okay  sporadically used not as intrusive as it could have been and it seems to integrate into the plot well moreover rather than just serve as padding it helps move the plot along this all said i would have preferred genuine dialogue at this point the movie was still heading down a rather safe predictable boy meets girlyadda yaddahappily ever after route the stuff of easy box office dollars rather than genuine artthen writerdirector damien chazelle of whiplash fame ups the ante moving it from a mere romantic drama to a drama that covers a host of themes  artistic integrity the price of fame chasing dreams the tradeoffs between relationships and careers missed opportunities and lifes big what if moments an incredibly emotional bittersweet ending ties it all together perfectly what appeared to be a quaintyetinnocuous film turned into a wonderfully profound hardhitting work of art,happy
ok i know the sound of music the king and i white christmasi didnt really like any of those i recognize that they are great timeless films that many people love including family members and friends of mine but if i personally had to pick a least favorite genre of movie id have to go with musical but my god this was great in fact its my second favorite movie of the year after hacksaw ridgethis is a colorful amazingly directed beautifully filmed movie that puts the music in musical without hitting you over the head with it in most musicals there is a song every five minutes and im sitting there facepalming myself another one already however spaces out its musical acts so that you appreciate them more when they appear and while i wasnt crazy about all of the songs most of the music in the film is gorgeous it also has an amazing ending several moments of comedy and a generous dose of warmth and feeling without becoming too sappy the only complaints i can come up with are a lack of explanation for a certain plot point but the filmmakers probably wanted this aspect to be left open to interpretation and the fact that gosling and stone are not professional singers however this makes the characters more believable in a way and you are certainly invited to relate to themmuch like the magnificent seven attempted to resurrect the western earlier this year and i enjoyed that film greatly as well set out to bring the musical back from the grave and if they can make more that are this good i say go for it once again these thoughts come from a cinephile that doesnt like musicals if youre like me i still highly recommend this film and if you do like musicals boy youre in for a real treat move over hamilton,happy
by that i mean the musical closet gotcha what a visual masterpiece some say being critical about something shows how much respect one has about what is being criticized worthy of critique i feel has received quite a bit of mixed views because somehow it portrait a telltale which is very dream like if not unrealistic is that really the point praises the very medium it is being portrayed through film and cinema it does so in a thoroughly enjoyable way by delivering the panache colour splash and the dazzle most of us actually dream of it is an optimistic vision in a world full of anger it is a nostalgic protest a loud praise for musicals of old and it is beautiful the cinematic execution is out of this world the production music fidelity filmography costumes the love for the form is transpiring through the silverscreen it makes you want to dance sing and celebrate are those feelings hard to enjoy it also makes you sad and angry at times it surprises it is fun it delivers all that with what i would call a perfectly fitting ending the scene on the clouds why care if it was corny all the awkward bits play into our own subconscious anxieties and insecurities at least for some oh well a solid bloody 10,happy
damn this movie is my favorite movie of all time its really powerful right from the start most people rated his movie low because they thought that the movie had an average story but they didt realize that is highest of the average kind it was worth my time and is re watchable the movie also has a lot of symbolism in it and they songs are absolutely brilliant especially city of stars and another day of sun guys i would definitely recommend watching this movie,happy
movies about how great movies are only by that the viewer can already feel excited and more if its well executed this film is definitively the case its a musical and a love story but that doesnt keep it from shining the film gives a perfect balance between the epic elements and the dramatic elements while also having very good and clever comedic moments damien chazelle has consecrated himself as one of the greatest most influential contemporary directors he will win every single accolade for it because he deserves to whiplash was great but certainly no masterpiece surpasses the boundaries of what a masterpiece should be the script is not being treated as good as the rest of the film but i disagree the script is powerful deep and compelling the acting is top notch and the musical numbers are exhilarating and exciting some people are unfortunately bashing on it without any good or constructive explanations yes its ok if you disagree from the objective perspective but if you hate something just because its nabbing all of the attention you are being hypocritical being jealous of something thats good in stratospheric levels will not prove any point some people are also not getting the ending im not giving any potential spoilers but the ending is not for everyone but if youre lucky enough like me or my parents and my sister who saw it with me for the first time and you get the idea and understand the subject youll get it and youll love it its been nominated for 14 oscars i wouldnt be surprised if it swipes them all i would instead be surprised and very disgusted if it doesnt win at least the big five awards best picture both leading actor and actress directing and screenplay if you havent go give a watch i give it my highest grade and recommendation it deserves that and much much more,happy
is a joy to watch from beginning to end i mean it is truly a love story to old school hollywood and theater musicals from the singing to the dancing and to the love story that goes throughout it the film was really so much fun to see play out on the big screen i am really glad i got see this movie stars emma stone and ryan gosling who both have dreams they wish to accomplish in life one wants to own a jazz club and the other desires to be a hollywood actress they each push one another with all there might to help the other succeed at making there dreams come true while also finding solace in one another as well the film combines the modern day idea of dreaming with the older style of it in a very well done way showing both the realities of being los angeles and the more glamorized version of los angeles as well this makes for a more enjoyable experience when you come out the theater overall is a film i would highly recommend people check out there is a lot of great fun here and a lot of enjoyment in it as well,happy
as big and daunting as los angeles is its also a relatively small town especially if youre trying to get into show business mia emma stone is one of those many hopefuls shes working at a coffee shop on the warner brothers studio lot giving the actors who are doing what she longs to do their caffeine fix sebastian ryan gosling is another hopeful also currently scraping the bottom of the barrel to keep the roof over his head in his dumpy apartment and to pay what bills he can which isnt many he plays jazz at any club that will have him mia and sebastian first meet in the notorious la traffic she is holding up traffic going over lines for an audition he is stuck behind her he passes her with a glare she responds with another unfriendly but definitely los angelan gesture their paths cross again later that evening after a party that mias roommates encourage her to attend after a bad audition she leaves on her own walking home after her car was towed and hears sebastian playing at a club she passes she walks in just in time to see him get fired for not sticking to the christmas set list she tries to compliment him but he brushes right by her months later at an 80s party mia gets some revenge as sebastian is performing with an 80s tribute band they end up leaving together in search of their cars and start a wonderful song and dance duet a la fred astaire and ginger rogersafter a number of close calls and missed opportunities in both professionally and personally sebastian encourages mia to write her own show she agrees though terrified of failure and writes a onewoman show she will also perform all sebastian wants is to own his own jazz club but he doesnt have the money so he reluctantly takes a gig with a fellow musician the group is very successful but its not the type of jazz sebastian wants to play and its keeping him apart from mia with glimpses of romance with each other and opportunities for success in the dogeatdog world of entertainment the two must make some tough decisions about what they really want out of life ultimately they both decide what is most important to each of them and they live happily ever after    though not quite how you might assumewas written and directed by damien chazelle who recently shot into the spotlight with his critically acclaimed writing and directing achievement with whiplash while both deal with music is completely different than his dark and torturous whiplash if bing crosby danny kaye gene kelly debbie reynolds judy garland or fred astaire were still making musicals today would be their product they dont make movies like this anymore but hopefully the will after this weve seen episodes of how i met your mother psych scrubs family guy and even south park pay homage to the art of yesterdecade weve also seen musicals revitalized with mama mia moulin rouge rock of ages and jersey boys but a musical set today with the feel of the 50s is long overdue and its been worth the wait as combines traditional old school movie sets mixed with some of the modern movie special effects that they couldnt even imagine in singin in the rain or greasegosling and stone lit up the screen in the preview coming across as the perfect kids youre rooting for both in their pursuits of their passions and in their blooming romance they delivered as did if you like any of the movies ive named just watching the preview probably made you smile with anticipation it just cleaned up at the golden globes with wins for best actor best actress best musical or comedy best director best original score and best screenplay i gave a very hopeful 4 star prediction but im boosting it up to 45 stars it was nearly perfect gosling and stone are a perfect match in their wit comedic timing sincerity romance singing and dancing if this is the first of many more modern day musicals to come then we are in for a real treat if this doesnt spark more of its kind it would be a shame but we were blessed with this rare gem and ill be adding it to my collection for suremarksmoviemindblogspotcom,happy
boy i am glad i got to watch this at the cinema because it is definitely worth watching therei want to describe as a visually beautiful nonclich romantic movie that not only has a stunning love story but also goes much deeper into topics like dreams and music while the movie stays rooted in reality which gives a lot of credit to the title i found it quite easy to understand why and that is exactly what i personally like about a movie of this scale it is capable of telling a story about difficult characters in difficult situations and explaining this in a simple way to the ordinary viewer this is why i think it stowed away so many oscars at the academy awards and also why it received so many nominations i will just mention a few of the obvious ones here just to awaken your movie hunger a little if you havent watched it yetemma stone did really deserve that oscar for a portrayal of the lost actress in la of epic proportions ryan gosling was nice to see as well in a more sophisticated role where he must have worked a lot harder with the character in this movie than some of his other typical bad boy roles in addition i also do feel the need to greatly applaud the entire music soundtrack in this film as it underlines the beautiful imagery and scenery of the movie behind the camera it is obvious that magic was worked here too i mean talk about experimental camera angles and zooming i havent seen anything like it since birdman so in conclusion what damien chazelle created here as the director and won the oscar for best achievement in directing is truly a remarkably beautiful timeless picture that will most likely be worth rewatching again and again,happy
although story is very simple wonderful leading actor and actress amazing camerawork and heartbeating scores have created splendid movie dance music and love what another do you seek for the entertainment movie will provide every inspector with every essential factor to amuse you should enjoy it without thinking what musical is true innovation can not be estimate by the concept that has existed before ever is just one of true innovative entertainment musical movie,happy
thank you to all the blindly biased negative votes given because i speak the truth the unnecessary negative votes point as to why this reviews point of view is a much needed one in a culture hellbent on insulting anyone whom does not share your viewpoint even when those attacking you are objectively wrong and hating those blindly whom disagree with your enlightened viewpoint thats what real bigotry is blind hatred if you hate my review or this movie for the reasons just stated that is the true bigotry and you need to get a reality check get out of the cultural idiocy and stop being so biased and calling it inclusivity i call bs on those whom criticize this movie for being rascist when it is obviously objectively not i am glad i read the negative reviews because i think they actually made me like this movie more as most of the insults were ridiculous and missed the point the most ludicrous being that because it is led by attractive white people that it makes it racist in fact criticizing a film for not having enough of a certain race is actually racist as it is a biased based on skin color newsflash thats what racism is fyi people if i apply that to the whiz the color purple or even hamilton those would be racist because they exclude white people either altogether or have only have a few cast members that are white it goes both ways racism is not exclusive to a certain skin colorbtw i like the whiz hamilton and the color purple despite their flaws however neither of those are racist and neither is lala land yes it does harken back to the golden age of musicals only with less musical numbers lala land has many black cast members and it lovingly dedicates a large portion of their film to jazz which was started by black people and it lingers on jazz players which outside of the male protagonist are black and definitely puts them in a very very high regardmy only caveat is definitely that it needed more musical numbers i read an interview with the composer and he said there were many left out of the film so if this gets transferred to broadway as there are talks of well hear them but i do wish more of them were actually in the film one main theme runs through the films but if anyone is familiar with the older films which this pays homage to particularly 1950s movies this is not uncommon i think of an affair to remember where the main song for that is played or sung at least 45 times throughout and is integral to the story as is the main theme that is played or sung throughout lala land it was fitting and appropriate especially because the main character is a piano player and a songwriter this film very much pays homage to musicians and the musical process i write songs myself and also used to act a good deal and i felt portrayed what it is like to be a musician who is just trying to get by but also has a bigger dream and how that process plays out the acting side with the auditions very much captured those feelings of the highs and lows of auditions and why being an actor is not always fun and games unless you actually make it but it is hard work in the process and often degradingi have done numerous singing and acting auditions over the last 15yrs the singing was not at all bad ryan gosling sang very well within his range if you want bad singing go watch vanessa redgrave and richard harris in camelot or pierce brosnon in mamma mia all phenomenal actors but terrible singers ryan gosling has limited range but he he used it very well emma stones singing was very girly and pretty a bit too airy at times but i really enjoyed her solo song towards the end where she finally shows her real chops she has a very fine voice indeed no the dancing is not plentiful but it is well done while i wish there was more tap dancing i am also a tap dancer i enjoyed what they did have although i would have liked it if they were stronger dancers i just appreciate that it was welldone enough and that they got actors who were fairly competent and at least had rhythm the cinematography was beautiful the splashy colors were a lot of fun i loved the bright color palette which also hearkens back to the days of technicolor very much like classic musicals such as hello dolly or seven brides for seven brothers or even westside story most pre1970s musicals actually there were many creative uses of the camera a lot of blurry shorts to make focal points clearer it was very creative while it is not perfect film as i said i wish there were more songs and dancing i truly felt it captured the lost feeling from the great musicals of the past and i really hope this does what moulin rouge should have done in 2001 fully reignite the modern movie musical as a monetary force when i left the theater i was humming the song and i still have the song that ryan goslings character plays with the jazz band he joins and plays a few times it is a great song all of the songs were very beautiful and wellwritten by the way i cannot think of many musicals i actually remember the songs to after only seeing it once if i never heard the songs before that didnt use pop songs as their score i can only think of one and that is on my own from les mis i had never heard that song before and it stuck in my head but no other song from that 30 plus songbook did i remember that i had not already heard but they were still great songs i can say the same for and dont laugh repo the genetic opera great cult film and has great music but not extremely catchy not all music including musicals is extremely ingratiating the first time you hear it i dont remember any of the songs from seven brides for seven brothers or hello dolly the first time i heard them they took time to sink in i still feel really good from watching lala land the next day it made both me and my husband giddy after watching it and the whole theater clapped after it was over that may not be your experience it seems to be polarizing but it is not because it is bad film it is a great film it may just not be to your personal taste god bless amy,happy
the beginning of the film did not really attract me and i was afraid then that it might be a disappointment given its so many oscar nominations but it turned out to be no big deal the story between mia and sebastian went frantically romantic instantly when they met each other the songs the dances and even the backdrops were too romantic to bear almost made me cry well i must say that i have listened to the soundtrack long before the release date but it is at the theatre with every single move and word of the characters that the music began to strike me however it is not the music that makes the film such an accomplishment the story is simple also a bit oldfashioned but really heartwarming and the ending is simply perfect they met each other dreamt about having the life with each other but faced the real world where the romance is only to be held in mind it is not so unrealistic but meanwhile offers the audience warmth at the maximum in other words you will find yourself stuck to the chair in the theatre when it ends everywhere on your body seem to melt away with the story i give it a 10 just because of the story and themusic i think should be extra bonus,happy
was getting so hyped up for the oscars and everything but i was trying to keep my expectations in check so the movie starts out with a song and dance routine in traffic that is super cheesy i lean over to my wife and say im concerned then the next number is emma stone getting dolled up and going out on the town with her gal pals way over the topim planning my movie review in my head alreadyand then it goes and turns itself into the best movie of 2016 the chemistry between the two of them is perfect the songs are beautiful and heartbreaking just an excellent film that i cant wait to see again 97510,happy
after years of hollywood filth uninteresting and painful to watch movies i found this gem of a movie that has tugged at my heart like no other i took my wife to see this movie after seeing the trailer but had no idea it was a musical we both are not fans of musicals and during the first opening sequence she looked at me and jokingly said im going to kill you and i just shrugged after another song we were both more drawn into the movie finally mia walks into the restaurant that sebastian is working at playing one of the most moving sad and romantic pieces i have heard in a movie the soundtrack really helped to set the emotion of the movieis one of the most fun inspiring romantic and sad movies we had seen in years ryan and emmas chemistry on screen is undeniable and made the movie so believable its been a couple of days since we have seen the movie and we are both still listening to the soundtrack and talking about the movie,happy
this is one of the best movies ever why well even the first scenes and great music introduce you to the plot lead you through the wide range of emotions and i can even sayyou can feel the happiness through the movie that sometimes fills your eyes with tearsthe two great actors gosling and stone are perfect couple matched through the story the dance and their dreams that should always be followed and believedi am surprised by the amount of huge positive energy that i have received from this movieand feel more powered to chase my own dreams is about the idea of art versus money and how the right person or your inner voice can help you to go back to the right road to your dreams is totally unique film with magical surrounding where sebastian and mia represent love art and dreamscongratulation to team excellent,happy
went to watch this movie tonight on my own and enjoyed every single moment such a great act from emma and ryan really appreciate such movies when actors can express fully their potentials apart from great play movie full of amazing songs and dance still cant believe ryan took piano lessons just for this movie he plays so greatlike he was doing it since he was a child looking forward to see them both on the stage with an oscar in their hands  will definitely see this movie again in the near future thanks all the crew for such a wonderful experience i will recommend it to everyone who want to see something nice romantic and inspiring looking forward to see both of them in their next movie,happy
an absolutely phenomenal movie that actually is as good as people say it is it brings a touch of classic films with good songs breathtaking cinematography great twists and turns choreography acting and of course the story its not going to be a 1010 for everyone but the idea to follow your dreams is something you dont see very much in todays movies and is the first film in a long time to do it flawlessly tomorrowland as a comparison failed with this to make this review spoilerfree ill say that everything from beginning to end is satisfying and must be seen at least once in your life the journey you go on with the leads is very entertaining and if seen in imax you almost feel like you are a part of it this is the best film in a long time,happy
is a spectacular musical focused on two aspiring stars living in los angeles the story focuses on sebastian an aspiring jazz pianist and mia an aspiring actress and their struggle to get their start in lai decided to watch this movie after learning that it tied for most oscar nominations and i am most certainly glad that i gave this movie a shot i fell in love with everything about the movie 20 minutes in i believe the director put a much deeper meaning in in terms of whether to follow your dreams or follow love at first i wasnt expecting this movie to be something like that but it unravels throughout the last half of the movie the movies score is amazing and justin horowitz did an amazing job with everything ryan gosling and emma stone have amazing chemistry just like they did in crazy stupid love i highly recommend everyone watch based solely on the score of the movie this movie does not disappoint,happy
is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast it is one of the most refreshing films to hit theaters in years the phenomenal damien chazelle harks back to the golden age of hollywood musicals all the while bringing a fresh new take on the genre it is not merely reflecting on the classic musicals but updating it for todays world the musical numbers are also outstanding city of stars being a particularly heartwarming song the final act did stumble a but for me it spends so much time developing sebastian and mias relationship in great detail for the majority of the movie that in the end it is as if they felt under pressure to wrap things up fast the ending itself is a well executed one but i will admit i felt underwhelmed by it i was expecting something a lot bigger that could compete with what we had seen with the rest of the movie the highlight has o be the undeniable chemistry between ryan gosling and emma stone they have worked together numerous times before that it seems almost effortless for them to perform with one another at this stage this is very effective for an audience watching two people simply enjoying being in each others company they chronicle the numerous different phases of these characters relationship brilliantly portraying the emotions they are undergoing in each moment it is original but it does not try too hard to be it simply wants to tell a story about two people trying to conquer their dreams heartwarming extravagant and well acted is a treat that any moviegoer should not want to miss two people trying to follow their ambitious dreams fall for each other along the way best performance ryan gosling,happy
if you are looking for a classical well packaged musical is ready to satisfy your search and even if you are not a great fan of musicals may appeal to you too the story is the classical story of a boy and a girl looking for artistic success and falling in love with all the difficulties that the opposition between success and love bring about and with a finale which is not that predictable what is appealing indeed is not the story in itself but the way it is shot and performed shooting is flawless music is entertaining but never obtrusive or boring dances and songs are enjoyable and charming the overall atmosphere is full of charm and soul and the two protagonists make a difference ryan gosling does a truly excellent job offering a thorough performance playing the piano singing and dancing very well and showing a very good and convincing chemistry with emma stone who offers a talented performance too the final result is that of a solid charming and well made musical a perfect execution by the young chazelle who proves to be a very promising director,happy
this movie is a dream come true and i know it sound weird but it is true at least for me the screenplay is just the perfect combination of romance comedy and drama the whole idea of dreams chasing them admiring the ones who have already achieve them is really inspirational also the dancing most of the time is was tap but even a waltz comes near which was a perfect touch i love musicals and this one is not an exception it is one of the best i have ever seen chazelle is a genius and also his work as a director was outstanding from beginning to end talking about beginning the introduction of this film was amazing the songs are really good also the dancing the performances made by the two leading roles emma stone and ryan gosling were incredible really really good especially stones one how both of them have their own history and passion the custom design were classic and pretty but at the same time very modern the cinematography is just perfect for the motion picture and film editing made me want to cry because it is excellent i love movies i love musicals this movie is just perfection to me heres to the ones who dream,happy
i enjoyed this movie very much because it had catchy tunes which will stay with you even after end credits me and my companion hummed those tunes for about a week and main duet rgoslingestone was absolutely fantastic on screen the dialogues jokes and all that jazz  jazz music brought back memories of musicals of old times and of course cinemascope i recommend this movie for everyone who has ever went on stage and it gives enjoyable break from action pack movies which i have seen lately ps if you dont like musicals and dancing on streets this movie definitely is not for you,happy
i have never seen something so entertaining sweet loving and moving in all my life this story is a tale of how we all need to dream and dream big but while youre dreaming live a life from the directors to the actors to score and to everyone involved kudos this is a splendid ride that you really will miss out on ryan and emma are masterclass and damien oh man oh man where was this guy all my life this movie is a 10the class of this film is in the intricate details strong possibility that this movie wins more than titanic and return of the king fingers crossed this film deserves every bit of love we can get these guys,happy
guess what it has plenty of scenes that are all about singing and dancing its why its called a musical i would dare to say so if you dont like musicals its quite possible that youre not gonna like this one but if you are willing to give it a shot please watch from the beginning to the end with respect because if you are willing to pay attention it may offer a good moment i like musicalsnot all of them i am not fond of every word being said while singing but i usually tolerate and sometimes i quite like it this movie is much more then a musical its a tribute to musicals to old cinema to acting to jazz and yet still manages to tell a typical story in an original manner when you think its all about the pretty songs and scenes the movie starts punching you with some reality and then reality strikes i found it amazing for giving me all those elements i just read a message and it made sense for me i laughed i felt like singing and dancing some times and i cried it gave me all that in about 2h so for me that is a great movie but i think its not the typical story that is delivered to you like in stories that are so strong by themselves they basically wouldnt need anything more to be worth watching or marvel movies that have many effects so its always an experience to watch so i can understand some people not liking itits not typical and if you like that then its new fresh and amazing,happy
the world was magical so i put up with intermittent excessive song and dance an everpresent current of warm piano gave the film a sense of unity that felt reminiscent of chazelles prior film whiplash i did not care much for the bland characters and their clich plights but ryan gosling and emma stone were not the central characters of this filmthe sets the music and los angeles were the focus over time my affinity for the film has dwindled but that does not discredit the pleasure i had in watching it for the first time as a whole was a captivating sensory adventure that was pleasing from start to finish,happy
i teared up often during the show at the end i got the same feeling i did with other oscar best pictures this show will win it this year its that goodaspiring actress mia comes across as more normal than many of her contemporaries which also makes her less likely to succeed as she fails many auditions while working as a barista sebastian or seb is a jazz loving pianist who wants to help the genre succeed but has to compromise by taking on paying gigs that dont inspire himas they meet initial clashes give way to chemistry and they inspire each other to pursue their dreams but to what ending remains unclearthere are many levels to the movie with homages to old and new movie musicals dancing and choreography are great but dont expect astaire and rogers bright primary colors grace the screen throughout particularly on the wonderful costumes about the only thing i didnt like was the excessive motion and swirling of the handheld cameras while our couple are the stars the music is what holds it all together and makes it the greatest you will leave feeling inspired and wistful,happy
with all the hype the movie was getting during this award season and the countless nominations it received i wanted to see what all the noise about this movie was about to my surprise it was actually pretty good emma stone and ryan gosling were phenomenal in it and the songs and music were extraordinary i would recommend this movie to anyone especially if they were into jazz or musical type of movies it almost sorta of reminded me of growing back in the day and watching high scholl musical or even watching grease last but certainly not least i didnt know that emma and ryan can hold a tone and also can ryan play the piano did he have to learn for this part and john legend being in this movie was the icing on the cake for me,happy
as the film progresses and is shaped each sequence is becoming more and more powerful until you reach the critical point where you simply feel that everything is possible as long as you do not stop following your dreams the film is magical and deserves all the prizes to which it was nominated accompanied by a delicious soundtrack and amazing songs that surely won the oscar is for me and many one of the best films of the last yearsemma stone and ryan gosling dance and sing wonderfully besides having a chemistry in the impressive film so it is not difficult to imagine them together the film besides being a tribute to the cinema of the 40s and 50s poses itself the problem of how to be revolutionary while remaining traditional and it turns out is an oldfashioned musical that despite being in the contemporary era reminds you at all times of musicals like singing in the rain etcpd if you do not give the oscar to emma stone i kill myself,happy
is a 2016 musical by the ascending director damien chazelle mostly known for 2014s whiplash it tells the story of the romance between mia emma stone an aspiring actress and sebastian ryan gosling a jazz lover musician it has los angeles city as backgroundhollywoods musical golden era is marked by movies like 1939s wizard of oz and 1952s singin in the rain seeing a musical on the big screen in plain 21st century is a bit hard to chew and i felt this right at the start in a la traffic jam people get out of their cars while singing and the first musical act of the movie begins this reminded me of my childhood fantasies where id be in a car and imagined people just stop driving and starting dancing on the roads so i couldnt help feeling this scene a bit cheesy and tacky but it was no doubt well executed with each of the many actors singing different parts in the song and making perfectly executed dance moves up and around the carsas more musical acts passed i felt less like treating the movie as just a corny musical and more as a merit deserving film in the second act emma stone shows up dancing with her housemates first wearing sweatpants and then changing to a beautiful blue dress she is the heart of this movie with the good acting making you relate to her in happy or sad scenes and understanding the eagerness that the character has for becoming an actressthen were presented to ryan goslings character who describes himself as a serious musician but ends up having to sacrifice his principles for the sake of being successful i felt that mias scenes outshine sebs because her aspirations seem stronger than his she struggles in auditions where people never give her credit and has to work as a barista to get life going however seb has a really strong point his love for jazz even when he makes speeches about musician i never heard about the meaning that the music has to him always feels genuinethe couple goes through the clich of first disliking each other and then falling in love there are a lot of scenes for the development of their relationship where they just talk to each other and one of my only problems with this movie is that some of these talking parts feel a bit dragged i feel that their love is much better transpired through the singing and dancing mia has a different colored dress for each season and this marks each of the music acts also the lighting is always beautiful weather it is the stars shining on the couple as they dance the las beautiful sunset the movie screen lightning their faces or the purple and red toned lights in closed spaces like restaurants and bars the music and the dance moves are very light all of these elements make very emotional scenes especially the one where they float through stars in the planetaryplays a lot of homage to the classic old movies for mias love for acting comes from watching them 1955s rebel without a cause is the most referenced but 1942s casablanca is the most important in this last one the romance of the starring couple is represented by the song as time goes by which is played a lot during the run time the same thing happens withs main song city of stars in the beginning it represents the happiness in mia and seb being together and in the end the sadness in them being apart this might not be the best movie in the world but its emotional tone is enough for it to deserve a lot of merita very interest plot point is when mia continues in the struggle this time creating her own one woman show play and seb starts making success with his new band this gets her inevitably jealous they have an argument and then go apart although our lives have the big goal to find love the ambitions for money and success always end up getting in the way this makes us less likely to trust people and drives us away from our important onesmias play is a disaster however seb gets a call from a producer who took interest in her he runs to the disappointed girl and convinces her to make an audition in the end they both get what they want seb opens a music bar where he can live only for his love of jazz and mia goes to paris and becomes a famous actress but they are forever separated the love and happiness of the classical musicals have no place in here even if mia fantasizes with her love for seb and her aspirations being in perfect balance she realizes while city of stars plays in the background that her goals couldnt be achieved had they invested in their relationship the ending shows the crudeness of real life winning over the fantasy happily ever after making this musical definitely a remarkable one,happy
this is the one we have waited fora thoroughly contemporary film musical that balances romance and realism in surprising ways director damien chazelle pays homage to classic musicals with allusions to among others vincent minnellis an american in paris and jacques demys the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort the selection of ryan gosling and emma stone to play the romantic leads is brilliant their aspirations propel the plot and their very ordinariness makes us believe again that dreams and memories can sustain us through the inevitable separations that life brings wisely every time gosling and stone break into song it ends too soontoo soon to bore us soon enough to leave us wanting more pieces of jazz rock and classical music are woven through the film but the thread that holds it together is the justin hurwitz score which includes the enchanting songs another day of sun a lovely night and city of stars as well as popular singer john legend singing his own composition start a fire los angeles has never looked so good even during a traffic jam and who knew how much we missed the xylophone,happy
la and jazz lovers i highly recommend you go see the new musical made by the writer and director of whiplash damien chazelle this film is dedicated to jazz lovers i am just back and will go back soon see the los angeles sunsets in panavision with such an original sound track was amazing my personal opinion of the film a real wonder an enchantment like if gene kelly meets audrey hepburn for a new musical some scenes are absolutely exceptional including several shots of several minutes real wonders and a formidable prowess of actors dancers and singers the story behind the movie is also exceptional and will bring you to think differently of the consequences of your own acts in life especially regarding love,happy
the anti critic  26012017moviedear mr chazellemi name is alejandro geffner but thats irrelevant at this point just a formality thanks to my older son 15 years old and fan of whiplash yesterday we went to the movies to watch your film i have been working for fifteen years in audiovisual production here in argentina looking for the magic of the movies and it was really hard to find it still i live in a country that constantly debates in between commercial and author movies and rarely occasions allowed us to see being born a director ready to unite those two worlds and the people of my country with it to make as feel one at least for a couple of hours is evident that your movie comes from a genuine romantic soul who has experienced in the body and conscience the love in his pure no form and crossed like a ray of light that make u time travelers as einstein discovered before and showed us in his formula that you transform beautifully for non mathematical readers up to this point that would be enough achievement and example for millions of humans souls over this heart but and here we go being able to transmit all that emotions trough the main stream commercial american studios is with no place for doubts an antenna we must keep on following but after this great success relax and take your time you dont have to keep on filming because the wolfs ask u to until the ideas dont come again from your own heart and desire from love story going to all that jazz and a little drops of birdman in the way you use the camera around the characters and places in that flow way or movies like mary poppins singing in the rain le baln rouge and all melis movies everything is delicate and focused in a simple human and profound story that leaves our seven musical notes open to leave the theatre and keep listening the sound of music we all carry inside and usually dont let go out and to unite us with our environment embracing us to go out and dance on the public places where usually souls get scared and keep inside hidden bureaucratized for surviving adaptation in rigid forms free play jazz is alive dont be scares about that dont be afraid bodies include brains and they are founding the reunion slowly and the all word is receiving the message there is only one truth and you know it and know how to transmit it thank you so much again for permit us to support over your play to use it as our floor as a trampoline to keep dancing the music of life of course years ago this text would have been written full of envy pero today near to the woman of my life the one i love completely in the way she loves me i can tell without the filter of my ego the same love than you deposit in this product of magic because without you wouldnt exist that makes you a chamn of the new millennium of the new acuario era you has encouraged to do what was necessary long time ago but nobody was doing in order to follow the rules that culture and industry impose as a prohibitionthe greatest icons has left their old bodies but are coming back in younger ones and is completely clear you have been chosen as their package lucky us they have founded you focused and working on your artkind regards from an argentinian friend,happy
is an incredibly colourful refreshing and creative film in the otherwise disastrous year that was 2016 this movie makes you happy to be alive and take any given opportunity you have theres lessons to be learned here but it never forgets to be escapist fun at its core is a film about dreams and goals what it takes to achieve them and coming to terms with what comes out of personal circumstances this is a film for dreamers and those looking to have a good time at the cinema this rejuvenating musical is exactly this and moredamien chazelle the writer  director of whiplash 2014 wrote and directed he takes the concept of musics importance in both films but tells completely different stories in each film the thing these two share in common is that its about the desire of the protagonists to pursue happiness both films do this without feeling overly pretentious or sappy and thats a hard way to tell these kinds of stories its personal in a way that the viewer has complete and synchronized empathy for the characters weve been in their shoes before emotionallyis a love letter reinvention and resurrection of the classic hollywood musical from an american in paris to singin in the rain is a retro film set in the modern day but it has the highflying and gorgeously colourful spirit of 1950s musicalsif you havent seen this movie yet please do so its a daybrightener and will put a smile on your face for sure its a movie you can relax toenjoy the finest film of 2016,happy

before the release of people were already pretty excited about the movie  mainly because of our favorite duo ryan gosling and emma stone and also because the expectations went for an epic love story to take place i was pretty excited too although i usually get turned off by people over enthusiasm for a movienow that i have watched the movie i can say that this is by far one of the most wondrous movies ive ever seen is a musical comedy following the lives of an aspiring actress mia emma stone and an ambitious jazz singer sebastian ryan gosling as they try to forge their paths through art and music while falling in love all at once it might seem a bit clich simple story but its a dreamy one that only gets better thanks to the magical touch of music and the theme of dreams is the kind of movie that instead of a scenario you watch the actors singing and dancing this instantly brought to my mind grease sound of music and west side story and others the only difference is that takes place in our contemporary world yet still it gives off the retro feelsand thats how revolutionary is having previously worked on whiplash damien chazelle has done more than an excellent job when he made this simple story into a piece of art narrating the story in a dynamic unexpected way this is a genius work in my opinion it was far from simplethe cinematography camera moves and shots colors costumes and lights this all was the soul of the movie as for casting i love ryan gosling for so many obvious reasons just like i love emma stone however at some point while watching the movie i had this feeling that what if mia wasnt emma stone dont get me wrong in fact she was really amazing she had a warm voice but she is replaceable unlike how things are with mr gosling their successful chemistry though is my solacei can talk about the theme of the movie for days i needed a movie like this i needed to believe not only in achieving my goals but also in fairy tales because thats what we miss in our world now the clash between your dreams and the sacrifices you have to make in the process was more than brilliant because unlike fairy tales this is purely realistic having someone in your back telling you not to put your dreams in the back burner reminding you that you are not stupid but letting go your dreams is the soundtracks couldnt be better justin hurwitz is the master of the beautiful tracks the best of which for me is city of stars and mia and sebastians theme the dance moves werent that exceptional but was more than enough for meagain having a musical comedy in a contemporary world with a touch of retro is something i never thought to be a thing that one definitely deserves the 14 oscars nominations,happy
is a musical romcom film starring ryan gosling and emma stone in the leading roles of a musician trying to find his way and a somewhat failing actressthis film is an beautiful love letter to hollywood and music as they are blended into one musicalfilm hybridone aspect that needs the highest praise is the absolutely beautiful and emotional music throughout the movie that drags you into the film and is an absolute beauty to listen to that sets the tone perfectly for every scene in this moviebut as every film has its best parts it also has its bad partscharacters as everyone knowsevery film needs good leads to captivate and engross the audience and this film has exactly thatthe characters throughout the film expresses their struggle with their careers and their personal struggles as well which makes the audience sympathetic for the the characters and understand them as peoplethe chemistry between the two leads is so convincing and shows the development of their characters because of each other showing their support and love for each other but also falls due to the clichs of romance tropes but tells a much deeper personal story within the characters and their dependence on each otherthe on screen chemistry between the leads of ryan gosling and emma stone was a great addition to this film and really drove the film for me in my opinion along with the musicalthough the romance does fall due to the clichs it is easily the best part and really developed the romance in such a way that it felt reali cannot praise the superb job the actors did in their respective roles and is worth all the praiseplot when it comes to the plot of the film for me its kind of hard to pin down what it was really abouti know the answer would be clear to other people who have seen the film but for me it was more of a music drives the film forward and gave me a better understanding of the story more then the actual film did which is quite a unique experiencebeing a big fan of the type of music used to tell the story in this film i enjoyed it a lot more then anticipated and got engrossed in the emotional impactful scenes that grabbed my attention and left me speechlessone problem i did have with this film was the way they executed the balance between the musical side of the film and the character interactions and developmentat many times during the film i would often forget it was a musical because of the imbalance of story being told and the musical sidethis would often become jarring but the absolutely fantastic music made up for the problem which was an easy way to keep the audiences attentionoverall this film was fantastic and well worth the watch due to its fantastic music and great acting along with the great on screen chemistry from the leads of this filmif any moviegoer has two and a half hours definitely see this film even if you are not a fan of musicals 9 out of 10,happy
damien chazelle mesmerized people with his film whiplash in 2014 so i had a feeling that this film of his would be good especially since i am a sucker for musicals but this was exponentially more than that this film is by far the best film of the year and will get several awards in the near future including highly likely wins for best picture best director best original screenplay best lead actress and several others in costumedesign production and scorethe film follows the life of a struggling actress mia played by emma stone who is waiting for her big moment and a traditionalist jazz pianist sebastian played by ryan gosling who is hoping to revitalize the beauty of jazz music by opening his own club both who seem quite disparate at first become intertwined in each other during their search for an answer for their disorderly lives mia and sebastian blossom into a beautiful couple that plays perfectly thanks to the help of some great dance numbers brilliant dialogue and hints of comedic genius despite the amazing chemistry between the two protagonists their relationship is sadly shortlived upon the realization that their dreams are a higher priority than one another the film fastforwards 5 years after the two of them drift apart into their respective careers with mia being a successful actress married to another man and sebastian being a credible jazz club owner the two former lovers run into one another at his club and the best part of the film ensues chazelle takes the audience through an epic what if montage that highlights what their lives could have been had they decided to stay together but more so representing the delusional that they once had and could have maintained overall we have a tendency to hold onto our convictions and this film takes that concept and demands us to continue to do so no matter how crazy they may seem because there is always hope regardless of the outcomeamazing cinematography perfect use of lighting and some of the best music ive heard in a movie in a while everything about this film was done with such radiant passion from chazelle who may have done just enough to bring back the bigscreen musical that once dominated the box officealis rating a,happy
i never thought id pay to watch a romantic musical but as i began to listen to jazz i gave it a shot movie immediately starts with dancing and singing and so sets the tone for developing romantic narrative if youre a jazz fan or like it im sure youre going to enjoy even though plot is very simple and a bit girly emma and ryan delivered good performances their dancing and singing wasnt that good but the main reason this movie is so enjoyable are amazingly chosen and arranged filming locationss is split into four parts each representing one season winter spring summer fall something like in requiem for a dream each part has its own ambient coupled with appropriate music which is made so well that sometimes i almost felt like i was there since those moments evoked some of my romantic experiencestheres no violence coursing drugs sex and other garbage hollywood is permeated with nowadays thats why can give you that nice feeling of being dragged into another world into like youd feel when you were a child its almost like a fairytale and all that beauty was made with a small budget my final recommendation is that you go to see this movie with your partner or date trust me that will add even more to an already amazing movie,happy
as charming as can be as creative as can be nearly perfect as can be if musical films are of any interest to you will demand to be watched from start to finish right from the start the highway music number is an incredible watch from production to performance it is an absolute delight to and is simply the beginning for what delivers for two hours ryan gosling and emma stone take what is a two character performance and runs with it the film rarely feels dull or boring as one or both of these two are on the screen no matter a spoken performance or musical number the charisma and charm bleeds out of these two with every passing moment with a chemistry that is through the roof damien chazelle shows his love of music and specifically jazz with yet another brilliant musicoriented film first he delivered us whiplash which remains to be one of my favorite films and now we have a film i did not expect to love as much as i did due to it being a musical but damien is simply a brilliant mind when it comes to these films i am excited to see what he will continue to deliver to the public in the futurea special note to the true meaning to the film that you never stop working for your dreams no matter how many times you fail or are told no heres to the fools who dream foolish as they may seemis an incredible piece of film as i said before i gained interest simply because i loved whiplash and what damien chazelle does with his films but i never expected to love a musical film as much as i did with a phenomenal performance by the duo of gosling and stone as well as simply a near perfect production background deserves every award it gets as it faces off with film titans in each of its respective categories with the coming award shows,happy
as a film does a lot of things right but as a musical it does a lot of things not so right the chemistry between emma stone and ryan gosling is undeniable and the story that is told between the two is very well done the jazz score of this movie is absolutely fantastic and does the movie a great service ryan goslings piano playing bits are honestly amazing and his character is fleshed out very well as is emma stones however emma stones singing sometimes leaves something to be desired and sometimes the direction of some of the dialogue leads to an occasional drop in the pace of the film i really wish that some unknown true musical theatre actors were chosen for this film rather than famous pretty faces but thats probably just me i truly believe that if you stack this film up against other movie musicals like west side story for instance it would fall flat on its face if this film came out say 20 years ago it would not be the critical success that it is now the traditional film elements that undertakes are generally very well done but as a musical it often fails 8210,happy
i went and saw without knowing much about it i didnt know anything tbh and i ended up falling in love with the film the acting is amazing the cinematography is spectacular but the music is the lure its the backbone of the film and its also the glue that holds it together the movie is a love story not only between the two main characters but between them and their dreams as well they are in a constant struggle between satisfying their relationships and the music appropriately and beautifully reflects the constant shift in emotions ryan goslings sebastian explained it perfectly when he talked about jazz music speaking for those who cant fully express themselves through words thats what the music in this movie does for the audience it supports the telling of the story the dancing in the film is another excellent source to show where the characters emotionally when theyre happy the choreography is fast during the romantic scenes the movement is more slow and flowing ryan gosling and emma stone were phenomenal during the dance numbers especially when you consider that some of them had long continuous shots besides the music and dance numbers i thought the acting was incredible ryan gosling is perfect at being both smug and charming while emma stone can put on an entire performance without uttering a word the expression she can convey just in the movement of her eyes and brows is nothing short of amazing in the end i fell in love with this movie and hard the story and acting opened my heart but the music is what warms it,happy
ive read a lot of onestar reviews here for this movie and have to say all of them say one thing i am a pessimistic nondreamer who hasnt any connection to artistic magical masterpieces like this onethis movie is for dreamers and people who want to dream if you are none of themyou miss out on life and you miss out on the beautiful message this movie has to give to many of usi loved i went to 3 screenings and looking forward to the fourth the story is beautiful without being too cheesy or anything near boring dont expect a typical hollywood romancecomedy expect a modern love story coated in vintage hollywood floating on musical wonders what i felt watching it for the first time and what came to my mind was magic you have to let go and take this movie and its wonderful music in the musicthe music is so touching it makes you wanna cry because you cant handle the feelings the characters and the music have an amazing bond just go and see it and if you dont get goosebumps at any pointi am sorry for you,happy
everything in this movie is just perfect starting for the idea that unlike most of the musicals are based on the fact that almost all the movie is singed with no purpose this film have the particularity that the characters only sing when they are feeling so great emotions that cant be expressed with only talking so they start to sing and dance as i said and as you could see they are not the best voices in this movie because the movie doesnt focus really on that as most of the musicals this movie shows a very human story which the one you can fill identified art music image and the complement of all this elements is just out of this world,happy
ill start off by saying that i am not the biggest musical fan and as such i went into this movie with a certain amount of trepidation hoping that the goslingstone combination that weve all enjoyed before would be enough to change my opinion on the genre im happy to say that to a certain extent it didi have to admit the all singing all dancing overthetop opening scene did little in the way of settling my initial concerns but from that point on the film was a delight light hearted with two excellent protagonists on one side you have sebastian an aspiring jazz musician looking to revive the romance of old style jazz while the rest of the music scene moves on on the other theres mia a stereotypical wannabe actress who spends her days as a barista in a la coffee shop between the hundreds of auditions that she hopes will one day see her discoveredits the ageold story of two young ambitious individuals who are surely bound by fate to end up together each with their own happy endings but aside from the basic premise nothing about this film is typical the chemistry seen between gosling and stone is one that has rarely been seen in recent hollywood movies both play off of each other perfectly and if you didnt know better you would truly believe that the two were in fact in a real life relationship but despite these two exceptional pieces of acting which will surely land one of the two an oscar the real praise has to land firmly on the shoulders of director damien chazelle for the way he assembled this movie for many the prospect of a two hour long musical is the stuff of nightmares 120 minutes of singing dancing and jazz hands but this is a musical like no other that ive seen each song serves as the perfect accompaniment to the exceptionally written script each lyric bares significance and the style and the understated manner in which it is all combined works perfectly its for this reason that the excellent as they may be performances of gosling and stone are left in someways out shined by their director a true triumph of musical film that is sure to go down as one of the great pieces of work of our time not least because it actually got a musical cynic like me to truly appreciate the genre and even consider a second runthrough in as many weeks,happy
i have very wide tastes in cinema but i generally avoid two genres musicals and horror however i was always going to make an exception for following the vibes from the festivals and indeed by the time i caught up with the movie it had already been nominated for no less than 14 academy awards putting it up there with other recordholders all about eve 1950 and titantic 1997among massive support the film has had its critics ok the plot and characterisation are slight but essentially this is a homage to the oldfashioned hollywood musical and we dont need a complicated narrative or lots of back story instead we have gorgeous colours and wonderfully zooming and swirling cinematography with uplifting dance sequences and a memorable soundtrack composed by justin hurwitz ok ive heard better singing and ive seen better dancing but ryan gosling as seb and emma stone as mia are playing a jazz pianist and an actress respectively and their singing and dancing is much more than adequate these are two glorious performanceswriter and director damien chazelle has given us a movie  such a contrast in tone and style from his previous whiplash which is destined to be a classic and become a longrunning stage show it is structured into five acts based on the seasons the vibrant sequence before the title  reminiscent of a scene from fame is shown is worth the price of admission alone musical numbers seemingly shot in a single take hold the attention and bring a smile to the face a scene where the two leads first hold hands in a cinema is pure romance the dance sequence in the griffith observatory is absolute magic and the bittersweet ending not what i expected but a realistic conclusion to a work that urges us to strive for our dreams whatever the costi just loved this movie and im sure ill see it again and again meanwhile i went straight out of the cinema and bought the soundtrack,happy
ive always said ryan gosling was meant to do comedy i think very highly of the guy but i hold the unpopular opinion that hes not necessarily the best dramatic actor in the world in he gets a chance to utilize some dramaticacting skills but strays away from his usual angstfilled characters as he showcases his humor chopsit helps that he and emma stone have such great chemistry with their third feature together crazy stupid love and gangster squad the pair demonstrate why they may be our generations gene kelly and ginger rogerstwo actors that are paid homage to in this filmis about a struggling actress mia stone who is constantly being rejected at every audition she has and a mercurial jazz pianist sebastian gosling who dreams of opening his own jazz club he is a talented musician but often finds himself going against his own integrity playing pop music and simple lounge standards the two meet in a way that would make any classic cinephile proud and over time develop a relationship each dealing with his and her own floundering careers is the processthe film acts as a love letter to los angeles its not necessarily a nice letter but its not a breakup letter either more like a letter to an abusive partner who you keep coming back to for some inexplicable reason only for them to spit on you and tell you youre worthlessit pokes fun at the city constantly saying out loud the things most of us would be tried for treason for ever thinking but theyve all been actual thoughts lingering in our minds at one point or anotherits a quixotical view of what la is supposed to beor used to be the two characters are old souls adamantly romanticizing what they view their ideal careers to be only to realize that they view this city in an antiquated way that no longer really exists in todays world things such as technology and loss of nostalgia are ruining it and they struggle to find the balance between the new and the old without wanting to compromise muchthe film on the other hand compromises the new and the old very well in its every moment the songs dont feel modern but they dont feel dated either theyre not necessarily poppy and affable at firstfitting well into the films jazz themegosling and stone are not fantastic singers but theyre not bad either which makes their performances all the more appealingtheyre one of usmuch like a nonnew yorker can empathize with a film that pays homage or lack thereof to new york one doesnt have to be from los angeles to get what the film is trying to say viewers can see where the movie comes from la is everywhere we experience it in almost every movie we watch in one way or anotherisnt just for los angeleans its for dreamers and people with big visions for people who have been rejected over and over and over again told theyre not good enough and still for some reason keep going back at it but like anything we love it takes a lot of work makes you believe in your dreams againtwizard rating 100,happy
when i first heard about a musical film directed by damien chazelle and starring emma stone and ryan gosling well the first impression was mixed although damien chazelle convinced me with whiplash it an was excellent film about jazz what im not big fan of it was truly a thrilling experience and my arms and body were shaking at the final act and jk simmons performance was justwell as good as everyone says it isbut now if i have to choose my least favorite genre of movies that would be musicals by far when all the praise and hype met my ears i even at that moment was ready to judge the film to be again an overrated oscarbait film that is not that great at all but it was directed by chazelle and it stars two actors who i like i decided to give it a shot i went to see it in 15th of january hoping the best and fearing the worst and it crushed my careful expectations to little piecesryan gosling is now becoming for a little by little one of my favorite actors he is not that type whos just sticking the same role from a movie to movie he can sing for an normal actor he can act he can do believable performances in romantic flicks like this and in for example dark crime movies like drive he nailed it as a jazz pianist but true star is emma stone her character is not an original not even close but stone blows so much fresh air to a very typical young woman who is dreaming being actress but the auditions are not going very well she makes her character likable and more than that she translates her to almost real life person with you can sympathize gosling does great job but stone is the true star with her oscarworthy work in this film kind afunny that there was only two true characters to follow the others were just sidecharacters who were there just to push the main twos stories forwardcinematocraphy is one of the best ive ever seen there were plenty of scenes that left me just wondering how could the do that it follows the characters and leaves free space to them letting them express their feelings patiently chazelle droves los angeles a picture of true colorful dreamworld that takes you to the 2hour unforgettable experience i loved the whole movie the opening was nicely shot songs were memorable and ending is not a typical one all editing sound etc were top notch films story is pretty much typical but in my opinion this film is not about the story it is for the ones who dreamit deserves all that praise and is joining club of my favorite movies and i dont like musicals at all i cant force you to like this film but i recommend it to everyone give it a shot i gave and i am so happy about that 1010sorry for my english not my mother tongue,happy
beautiful charming and pure this is a true work of artthe movie introduced us to two amazing artists one was an aspiring actress and the other was a passionate jazz pianist they were both broke and trying to look for one chance that can change their life on that road they met each other not once but three times coincidentally like destiny of course each one has their own big dream to pursue and that passion had taken them to each other but money was a big problem so sebastian had decided to give up his dream temporarily to join a band even though he didnt like the music he played the movie went from a joyful colorful air to a sad one after these two had a fight and then mia failed at her show she decided to end their relationship and went back to nevada but sebastian pulled her back thanks to a director that went to her show and discovered her talent five years later mia had become a famous actress but stayed friends with sebastian she even got married and had kid and that is where i find it interestingthe movie didnt go to a predictable happy ending it made a twist a right twist to remind the audience that life is not perfect and not every love stories end the way it should but once more the destiny had led them to each other when mia and her husband came to sebs sebastian had finally made it he had his own jazz club they saw each other and sebastian played that one song that mia saw him playing for the first time and this time he turned it into a masterpiece the song was like an apology to mia saying to her that he shouldve stopped and talked to her when she gave him a compliment about his talent that everything could have been different and they could have been together thats why the song was also his dream that we can see when they made a flashback but in that flashback everything was bright and happy it was fun to watch that but very sad at the same time because what couldve been done is not what has been done and that is what made the movie beautiful and pure it left us with a open ending to keep us wondering thinking and believing after all destiny had led them to each other once who says this time is going to be different thats why i love open endings because it gives us a chance to use our imagination our belief to continue the story ourselves and for me its a way to keep the movie inside my heart it becomes my own,happy
damien chazelles is made with pure ambition  genuine skill a romanticcomedy drama packaged as a musical this recent oscar frontrunner is a dazzling watch however despite its luscious beauty  an extraordinary performance by emma stone the film is somehow fumbles in its later half that takes away its glory to some part but a small glitch doesnt shun away its undeniable meritssynopsis a jazz pianist ryan gosling falls for an aspiring actress emma stone at her best in los angelesis a lovestory that has some of the most beautifully choreographed musical numbers in years each  every song is exquisite  a treat for the eyes i was awed by the detailing  the overall presentation hats off to the teamand chazelles world works even when its not being a musical yes the lovestory between its leading characters is warm  believable you watch  later explore these two people in love  how their dreams come their ways is a lovestory for sure but it also indulges in themes like life itself  how dreams cannot be compromised even when they damage relationships at times chazelle treats the narrative with realism all through the firsthourand thats exactly why the secondhour underwhelms the addition of a subplot featuring john legend who offers gosling to play with him is clichd  seems out of place for a film that so beautifully mounts itself on such magic in the firsthour chazelles screenplay takes risks  adds extravagant musical numbers  drama  makes them come together but he seems to have given in to clichs  a lackluster middlepoint i wasnt impressed by the subplot nor by the difference of opinion the couple get into there after chazelles screenplay picks up again  the culmination is affecting how i wish he dared to add something more rather than adding a turn weve experienced an umpteen number of times in such storieschazelles direction is fantastic  theres no doubt on that while his writing lacks perfection his direction is superior at all times is a visual spectacle with soul  chazelles true skill as a storyteller comes to the front surely some oscar calling awaits himlinus sandgrens cinematography is topclass tom crosss editing is terrific justin hurwitzs score is enchanting is a true musical ride as the songs here are chartbusters art  costume design are marvelous performancewise emma stone owns with a careerbest performance stone fearless  relentless emerges a big winner here delivering a performance that comes straight from the heart she beautifully conveys her dreams of being an actress who sadly hasnt gotten a chance to shine  how truly she falls for a man stone is faultless  may i say that she has never looked this gorgeous before ryan gosling on the otherhand is nicely understated as the jazz musician whod never let his passion be bygone even though its nearly dead gosling expresses with ease  his approach to love is real also the onscreen chemistry between stone  gosling is infectious a special mention for j k simmons  rosemarie dewitt who shine in brief roleson the whole doesnt utilize its potential entirely but its still a solid effort that shouldnt be missed its definitely among the better films weve seen this year  this film deserves to be experienced in the cinemas i saw it at imax  it only heightened the impact no where elseand i miss you los angeles see you soon,happy
is for many the oscar winner 2017 if it is the best i do not know the film is very good it is the photography is incredible it has beautiful scenes the night combines with the film the the film is very good the initial scene of the film is very good and well choreographed the direction of the young damien chazelle is very good is only 32 years old and already has whiplash and in the curriculum a director with a bright future  the cast is competent emma stone is incredible and without doubt is a strong competitor for oscar for best actress ryan gosling is well more sincerely i do not see him winning the oscar i think casey affleck will win and has still the jk simmons john legend and etc the script is good but not quite as original and the soundtrack is excellent is undoubtedly one of the best musicals of the last years and is a strong candidate for the oscar 2017 note 85,happy
my head hurts i havent had this great of a cinema experience since whiplash not only is it a love letter to old hollywood films its a love letter to achieving your dreams its a love letter to la its a fk you letter to the industry in la honestly its the definition of great filmmaking its the reason i go to the cinema lol it could literally win 14 oscars and i wouldnt even mind ugh the way it switches between modern style of musical to the singing in the rain vibe it shook me i was blown away by the cinematography production design and especially the editing after seeing whiplash and wow can we talk about all the whiplash references chazelle put in there i knew the editing would be superb but this was just they even made me like the fade effect which is usually a big no no for me not only is it a tremendous script but the way the lines were delivered its like theyre already classics the first time you hear them even though the film was already greatness the ending is what really defines it an iconic timeless masterpiece just like whiplashs ending damien chazelle truly is a god i dont deserve and i cannot believe im saying this out loud but was almost as good as the legendary whiplash go see it dont listen to the fools giving it a 110 is sitting on 14 oscar nominations and 7 globes for a reason if you dont like it go argue it with your mama,happy
a jazz pianist falls for an inspiring actress in los angelesthere was a moment back in the 1970s when the image of people bursting into song and dancing in the middle of a motion picture wasnt simply cheesy it had come to be seen as downright strange but not anymore our era is immersed in a retro musical culture damien chazelle wants to make a musical that celebrates the classic hollywood vision of love as a spiritual perfection this is is really quite beautiful and as another oscar season begins this time under a dark cloud of controversy movies like this one take their natural place escapist wonderment that reminds audiences and cinephiles like me why they bother staring at flickering images on a wall in the first place the heart and soul of this movie are rooted in the past and so are its characters emma stone and ryan gosling is a romantic that almost feels chemically balanced to perfection these two belong together because of gosling his malice dipped in honey and stone her vivacity and pensive awareness creating a teasing romantic connection but mostly they belong together because they dance like this they are the new gene kelly and shirley mclaine their notsomeet cute takes place on the freeway indeed the film opens with one of the most extraordinary sequences in years a musical number set in the morning commuting and traffic jam along with a vast stretch of la freeway the camera hurls with astonishing choreography intricacy among the passengers on their way to work cinematically the sequence makes the impossible look easy it also serves as a setting for optimism and emotional expectations by staging this number chazelle invites us to return and stay inside an enchanted romantic universe in my opinion damien chazelles is the most audacious bigscreen musical in a long time an irony of ironies that is because it is the also the most traditional one director pays an aweinspiring homage to the look mood and stylised trappings of the hollywood musicals of the 40s especially the 50s with starry nights and streets lamps lighting up the innocence of softshoe romance and two people who were meant for each other literally dancing on air the stroll scene is one of my favourites as damien chazelle stages a gorgeous scene over a view of las glittering carpet of lights that merges into pastel twilight they sit talk and start dancing just like actors did on sets in the 1950s sooner she lays her eyes onhim across a crowded room a stranger playing the piano except that the look on her face tells you that he is no stranger at all she is not just starring  she is falling that is the sublimity of old hollywood where we believed that it could happen just like that maybe only french cinephiles of a certain age will realise that the writer directors true inspiration here is not as much from vintage hollywood musicals as from the late french director jacques demys two landmark 1960s musicals with michel legrand the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort  especially the latter which was far more dance and jazz oriented what i love about damien chazelles movies is that he incorporates music in his movies he did that with whiplash and he does that more than ever here the music becomes a character among all other characters moreover la has rarely looked this gorgeous in films a credit to the directors romantic imagination as well as to the technical expertise of swedish cinematographer linus sandgren american hustlefinally is the story of oldschool dreamers trapped in a world of entertainment commerce that is designed to crush the life out of you it is a reminder that the often selfdestructive act of dreaming is the very elixir of life this film is a love story to passionate people people who have a dream people who want to succeed in doing what they love someone who is going to no matter what anyone says go ahead this film grabs the shoulders of anyone who is passionate out there shaking them until they get out there and follow their dreamsoverall is an unapologetically romantic tribute to classic movie musicals splashing dream  chasing optimism everywhere i was utterly absorbed by the films simple storytelling and the terrific lead performances from emma stone and ryan gosling who are both excellent particularly emma stone who has never been better they both carry chazelles musical numbers off with delicacy and charm,happy
the two actors emma stone and ryan gosling are two at their best the storyline  much the same the music is wonderful sentimental at times and delicious the screen writing is a lesson on how to take a two handed sword and sticking it into your heart yes it has its affect but the cost of which is not wanting to put family and friends into the position of watching it lest they commit ritual suicide themselves b your recommending it to be watchedand never with children present why must all musicals end with love being forsaken and abused bring a needle point knife along to kill yourself not because the actors were remiss but because the director just couldnt and wont believe in happiness,happy
i honestly cant say too specifically why this movie is awful because i only watched maybe 20 minutes before shutting it off i love musicals and was looking forward to this after hearing all the hype big disappointment from the beginning i was just bored senseless and i got tired of trying to figure out the point of the story i kept hoping it would get better but i finally decided life is too short to waste time on something this tiresome maybe someday when im feeling particularly masochistic ill give it another shot,happy
it was great from a filmmaking perspective the music was great and so was the cinematography and it also had some good long takes i just didnt like it that much i just dont like musicals so it really comes down to personal preference luckily i dont rate movies subjectively so im giving a great rating,happy
i finally got around to watching this film and going over other peoples reactions to it i find there is one thing that doesnt get touched upon so i felt it needed to be saidi had no problem with gosling or stone in these roles i thought they did fine with the material they were given my problem with goslings character comes from him being the stereotypical and unoriginal jazz purist with a chip on his shoulder what really set me off about this film was the ending sequence after 5 years going their seperate ways and both being successful they see each other one night in his club as hes going to take the stage and play at this point stones character has become a movie star and is married with a cute little girl when gosling starts playing he plays the song she first heard him play all those years ago starting a dream sequence of what their life would have been like if they stayed together but not just if they stayed together but if they had the perfect life instead of rushing past her in that club and bumping into her as he leaves he instead grabs her and kisses her when she has her one woman play she for some reason has a full crowd of theatre goers that love it she still gets her big role and he ends up going with her to paris and when they have a child its a boywhat is the point of this whole scene who is this point of view from her him both it doesnt make sense and is poorly contrived plus in their perfect life they had a boy and not a girl whats that about thats the part that really felt off to me when i saw this film and started to upset me more and more as i thought about it the next dayscrew this movie,happy
it was an ok movie with a great cast i did love the music and songs but there was not enough to be called a musical the start and end was great but the middle was where i was let down it started to drag and i did start to get confused emma stone definitionally deserved best actress but the movie it self is over exaggerated and lacked the middle which is just as important as the start and end,happy
when i was 12 i saw on my birthday and it changed my life this display by damien chazelle is wonderful and magical as it plunged you deep into the struggles of love and la stardom,happy
it seems like the whole movie is a big los angeles tourism commercial however saying that its a fun up beat movie with vary little storyline and substance unfortunately ,happy
this movie great movie emma stone thx for playng the role in the movie,happy
is the movie that takes you exactly where you want to escape to when watching a movie the technicolor world of music dance and vibrancy all around is enough to fulfill your hearts deepest desires the juxtaposition of magic and wonder contrasted with the realism that follows both the entertainment and music industry is beautifully intertwined with a brilliant soundtrack that truly moves you and exceptional performances from gosling and stone youll love this movie from start to finish ignore the taint of bad reviews that this film suffered not overhyped or boring at all a masterpiece 1010,happy
this movie is just absolutely remarkable i could talk about everything that was amazing for hours and hours nothing about this movie is wrong the script is beautiful the message is beautiful the music is freaking outstanding and the overall look of the movie tops everything else ive ever seen the combination and balance of color makes this movie so appealing one of my favorite things too is that every setting is real theres no green screen used anywhere you get real city shots and gorgeously painted sets ive watched this movie 7 times and counting and constantly catch myself singing justin hurwitzs incredibly composed music just everything about makes it a must watch and youll need to rewatch it a few times as well,happy
im so glad i finally got to view this movie shortly after valentines day 2019 as i lived in la during the 1960s while in graduate school it brought back so many on location memories i loved the hollywood hills sunsets and the everyday street life views now i understand why the film and cast received so much love and acclaim,happy
this is a beautiful film i love it the songs will be a future classic i never get tired of listening them,happy
the story such romantic movie the story is well written the story the music  the dance work so well together no scene is unnecessarythe directing both of the main casts have beautiful voice and dance so well together great chemistry between them it is always refreshing to see a movie done in musical way definitely could feel how beautiful their love for each other well done,happy
everything required has already been said in the headline so why are you still reading this,happy
now i like cazz and listening city of stars i met a new think for me musicalsthe all these years i did not feel musical so much like this after that i will try to memorize musical thanks for this movie to for everything gained,happy
i found this movie absolutely wonderful from the spectacular performances to the magical and touching musici watched it twice in a month and it still brought me tears and laughter and butterflies in my stomach such a beautiful story really captivates the viewer its a must see ,happy
i want to think about there are very worthy comments about cinematography and technical details that i dont know for this picture but i couldnt imagine which romance movie can make me excited there are several reasons why i lovedfirst of all damien chazelle could choose masters of love or the most popular actors and actresses that people love them such as eyes wide shut but chazelle wanted to tell another story between man and women different from classic romance moviesecondly some magnificent landmarks of los angeles inspired me to travel that landmarks has been used like a painting that i want to buy for my home so that is precious to most of usthird the soundtrack of is magical justin hurwitz who made them and won two oscars makes a perfect defination about jazz every single record touch my emotions and i probably listen them at the traffic sleeping studying rest of my lifeas a result i think most of people can find something precious about love art or life experience from the saying why do you love that its overrated is unfair,happy
a musical composed of the moments in dreams reality and everything in between la aa land is a soulthrilling intensely felt rollercoaster of emotions that even acrophobians will enjoy a ride on this movie is strongly structured with a soundtrack that will steal your heart purposeful camera techniques the subtle and realistic execution of acting and major characterization throughout the entire film from the opening scene to the ending credits mia emma stone a barista with aspirations of becoming a big time movie actress is too set in her bland reality to pursue her dreams sebastian ryan gosling is just the opposite a jazz fanatic wandering his dreamworld hoping that one day it will all be his reality and in the meantime unwilling to settle for any job that doesnt fit his perfect idea of starting his own jazz club when sebastian and mia find each other their first few runins are some what of an unpleasant nature from road rage during a heat filled la traffic jam to a rude encounter at a bar childish teasing during a party is what could have been the end of their encounters however fate falls into play and mia and sebastian fall into each otherafter a long la party sebastian and mia walk to their cars together along a lamplit street and a sunset sky the two share a dance and sing a duet saying that they simply have no feelings at all towards each other its ironic that the two sing such things in perfect harmony and with the synchronized choreography by mandy moore the scene is portrayed with such charm that its overwhelmingly captivating and honest the chemistry between them is as electric as the la city itself its very clear that the two complete each other strengthening their weaknesses through the others strong suitthe way that a movie is shot makes or breaks a film every angle every movement every frame means something for instance when mia went to sebastians concert she started out close to the stage when the music picked up into a sound that wasnt sebastians style the camera linus sandgren takes on a wide angle shot and shows the crowd of strangers pushing mia back farther away from him this shows us that as sebastian morphs into someone mia cant recognize they will grow apart another example of why the filming is so important is when mia and sebastian go to the movie theater as their hands fumble into each others for the first time sandgren decides on a close up shot to make it seem like that is solely the only thing youre meant to notice however the dialogue of the movie that plays in the background the one no one would ever pay attention to discreetly hints at the ending of the movie simply due to the shot chosen you only subconsciously pick up on it this is clever because you might not even understand they you knew the ending all along it until you watch it a few times throughbeing a musical its obvious that one of this movies key components is the score justin hurwitzs composer did a miraculous job at creating music that allowed the audience to connect and become invested with the characters and their performances with three oscar nominations for his work in its clear to the ear that each musical number was deliberately written to enhance certain emotions of every individual scene the music in this film often arise from a soft dreamlike tune to a lively upbeat and loud one this aids the audience in getting a sense of the reality verses the dreamworld and even gets them caught in between the two although nearly every song goes back and forth from soft to loud one specific song stick out the movies most popular song city of stars is played many times throughout the film in different renditions each carry a unique mood for instance its first introduction to the audience is when ryan gosling sings about the city all by his lonesome as he walks along a pier in the early evening he sings the song as a hopeless romantic like sebastian would in a rather pensive and calming tone expressing that hes drifted into another dream in the second version of the song ryan and emma sing alongside each other its played with a more upbeat mannerism at some points in this version the two even giggle playfully with each other this symbolizes that together the stars have never looked brighter it shows that they both have a positive outlook on life and feel that dreams are achievable in the third version the simplicity of emma stone humming the songs tune leaves the audience with a light hearted giddy feeling almost like a daydream it shows the effect that sebastian has had on her and at the end of the movie after weve witnessed all that mia and sebastian have been through the track plays once more this time its morphed into all the songs from the film for the big finale this brings back all the emotions we felt at once it overwhelms us in the best way possible and its an experience everyone should have the melody of this final rendition of city of stars shifts from a hopeful and curious tone to one of remembrance as it is played differently than its past debuts you get a sense that its no longer a turned page but the closing of a bookaside from the technical aspects of film culture such as filming score and acting was enjoyable to the fullest extent not once was there an unintended dull moment and its not doubted to be one of the best films to arise in 2016 with 12 oscar nominations and 5 winners of best actress emma stone best cinematography linus sandgren best director damien chazelle best original music score justin hurtwitz and best production of design david wasco you should not worry about walking out of the theater disappointed,happy
damien chazelle directorproducerscreenwriter is the brilliant director to his second major success after his previous awardwinning movie whiplash he directed this movie is about two people living in los angeles california trying to achieve their dreams the first character we are introduced to is mia emma stone who has loved acting her entire life she writes her own oneact play with hopes to become a successful actress while the second main character sebastian ryan gosling who is in love with jazz music is trying to open a jazz club after their random encounters they fall into a stunning romance full of song and dancea musical like no other director damien chazelle uses the movies beautiful music in a way that you dont see every day the music is used to further the characters not just the plot of the movie in musicals like the greatest showmen the music is used to tell what they are doing not who they are you learn more about mia through her song called someone in the crowd this song not only shows what is happening in her life but also the life people have as a struggling artist while the music was amazing the movie also had subtlety wonderful costumes the entire movie stuck with minimal patterns on the clothes with vibrant colors to make the actors pop in the first dance song that mia was in she was wearing a bright blue next to all her friends wearing equally bright clothes this just makes the audience feel as though they are with the characters in sunny california in scenes where chazelle wanted to send a message he would dim out all the lights having a sole spotlight on the character this created a contrast to the brightness of the characters emphasizing the characters intense emotions the characters mia and sebastian were played beautifully by stone and gosling they had previously played in two movies together and in you can see why their onstage chemistry is evident not only can they act they can also sing and dance which is an amazing combo to have as amazing at the actors are they didnt have the script to fulfill their endless potential we learn very little about mias actual life when she is writing and performing her oneact play there is no detail on the process it took to make the play or the people who helped and when mia goes into an audition she is asked to tell a story but she tells one about her life not her aunt the character mia is amazing she would be even more amazing with a history the scene itself was beautifully done they do a complete pan shot around stone as she sings a beautiful story about her aunt the turning pan shot represents the major turning point in the movie made the movie similar to older movies theres dancing around lamp posts and doing everything they can to achieve their dreamstruly is one of damien chazelles best movies this movie is one for the record books its about achieving your dream no matter the cost its a symphony of music love and color is a musical has one of the best soundtracks out there this movie makes you feel in sunny california with the marvelous character mia emma stone and sebastian ryan gosling,happy
what a piece of cheesecheese actingcheese directingcheese storyand cheese dancing,happy
it blowed my mind at first i thought it is like the other movie but then everything completly changed i didnt understand how much i fell in this movie you cant stop listening the magical music of this movie specially city of stars the playing paino was great every thing was awsome but in last secense i understand what a great movie is it was incredible,happy
18 december 2016 2016 in a way is its own movie genre a fusion of musical and drama that in just a few places doesnt seem to completely fuse well together as a smooth jazz duet the few discordant notes arise from its lack of a full range of musical variety as in moulin rouge 2001 chicago 2002 mama mia 2008 or even west side story 1961 in one place the music almost becomes repetitively dull and monotonous in most other places however the music is amazingly broadway of the highest sparkly quality dazzling in its choreographic display captivating sound and creative photography in birdman 2014 style at a few other places in the movie the serious prolonged drama comes forth that threatens to crack the musical fantasy mood but holds together this bold and risky venture manages to reveal the refreshing potential of a newly minted theatrical approach to filmmaking even the ending scenes even though unsettling offer up a much more mature realistic and surprisingly satisfying musical wrapupthe dramatic romantic storyline is suggestive of the trials and tribulations from my girlfriends boyfriend 2010 my best friends wedding 1997 if only 2004 days of wine and roses 1962 roman holiday 1952 sliding doors 1998 bridges of madison county 1995 a man and a woman 1966 and even nanny diaries 2007,happy
one of my favorite movies ever utterly enchanting and magical the ending was perfect and gutwrenching both emma stone and ryan gosling delivered stellar performances but the star of the show is the songwriting choreography and cinematographycamerawork a story that will leave you pondering about the limits of dreams and the seams of reality the breaking points inbetween and which sacrifices are worthwhile,happy
i loved the colors they caught some beautiful pictures with their cameras some songs in this were catchy and memorable also some scenes hit me emotionallyit has musical parts in it but its not always musicaloverall id say it is a movie worth seeing theres definitely something about it i can see why some people dont love it though but also why some people do make up your own mind i think it had good parts in it that definitely convinced me but maybe its not as big as it couldve been,happy
most beautiful film i ever seen  i will watch this movie for every christmas ,happy
this is a movie lovers delight from the opening few frames you know youre in for something special and damien chazelles valentine to romantic musicals never falls short of pure delight from beginning to end its an ode not so much to hollywood as much as its an homage to the fictional world that existed within hollywood musicals where practical details are mostly irrelevant but cynicism is not welcome reminding movie watchers why they love movies in the first place emma stone and ryan gosling as perfectly matched with charisma affection and chemistry galore perfectly able to give a willing audience the warm and fuzzies as we follow them along their trek to immortalized hollywood romance its really something special to watch capable of bringing genuine tears of joy over how beautiful and masterful everything is from frame to frame scene to scene interaction to interaction song to song etc truly a remarkable accomplishment for all involved,happy
bob fosse and his dancing company are doing it again the movement of bringing the causality to a play production or piece of performance is an unique attempt at belonging on stage the inevitability of a move that is not choreographed made a smile from afar on another planet,happy
damien chazelle is a real artist who positively surprised me with the use of colour the director didnt fail to bring another beautiful work onto the screens and the movie stayed in my memory even for non musical fanatics this is a mustsee which deserved all the oscars that it received the film portrayed all emotions fantastically and conveyed the raw real emotions through the use of different hues and absolutely amazing lighting techniques one of the things i noticed was the ballet of the camera and its swift movement which the director demonstrated to us before in whiplash but what i really want to say is chazelle is a real artist,happy
i love this movie so much i downloaded the soundtrack i love the concept of what ifs vs reality its such a beautiful film and of course i loved it even more especially being emma stone is one of the main actresses this movie made me fall in love with love all over again looking forward to a sequel even though it doesnt need one because its that good,happy
i never thought i would have liked a musical  but so be itoriginal amazing music never a moment of boredom or banality to be reviewed seen november 2018,happy
i love these fantastic songs in it and the beautiful color while the part of dance and the end of scene but i dont like the whole story,happy
this strangely took me back in time to a 90s movie loved every second,happy
its an amazing movie the director was amazing ryan gosling and emma stones chemistry is amazing the songs dancing and colors this is,happy
this movie is so fabulous on every level i cant get enough of itthe cast is perfection storyline makes old new again thescenes around la beautiful ending sublimedont miss this ,happy
im not one who enjoys musicals so going to the theatre to see one was tough i gave this movie a chance and it was well worth it incredible cast music that made you come alive inside and an amazing story it was truly a phenomenal cinematic experience,happy
im doing a bit of catching up with some 20162017 titles and has been one of my most anticipated the film is absolutely brilliant from every standpoint obviously it gets ton of credit for the cinematography score songs etc but its all for nothing if it doesnt have emotioni havent been this moved by a film in a long time the full of real life ending is where the film rises to the masterpiece category theres something bubbling under the happygolucky cover and i kind of got similar nostalgic vibes from the story than what boyhood 2014 offeredaudition the fools who dream is a fantastic song that tickles all the right senses obviously every review has to also mention the opening scenedone the two juggernauts of that years awards season moonlight and this are both something special but id probably give the slight upper hand to a very rare four and a half stars out of five from me,happy
im amazed that this film has created so much noise i found it empty and leading nowhere i hate to leave a film unfinished curious to see how it ends but this one was just impossible for me after 30 mins of stoic patience i just gave up,happy
a nice blend of the musical and nonmusical is a successful modern take on a vintage film tradition navigating the paths two starcrossed individuals pursue in their quest to attain their goals in the city of dreams roundedup in a bittersweet and deeply moving ending its nice to see good musicals are still being done these days a memorable depiction on the heart of what it is to be human this will linger with one for days even for life,happy
everything in the movie was stunning storymusic screenplay etc and you definitely get the vibe of watching old animated movie ,happy
the movue is good and music is also good but i am disappointed with the ending but the movie is good,happy
finished rewatching after seeing it twice the elements that stands out the most are the cinematography and directing the set design is vibrant and just fun to watch the inclusion of magical realism also added an extra layer to the films design the director did a great job crafting a world based around the extravagance of magical realismacting wise the movie was solid i dont think best actress solid but that is just me ryan gosling was great as expected i do think the pacing was a bit off near the halfway point cutting away a bit of the fat could have helped a bit overall a 8 out of 10,happy
is an epic romance tempered with reality its about two people trying to make their dreams come true in hollywood and how much their willing to sacrifice along the way along with great music and choreography the story ranges from hilarious to heartbreaking in spite of its bittersweet undertones theres a lot to love about for those who were left bewildered by the ending heres some clarification so you wont be left scratching your head the following is not a spoiler but references the last scene the final musical montage was how seb imagined his life might have been if hed given up on his dreams afterwards the smile he shares with mia indicates theyre both satisfied with the choices theyve made,happy
seemingly frivolous details can destroy ones most cherished dreams feelings of excitement and disappointment are reflected in the music and lyrics in the lyrics are enjoyable and lifeaffirming the film teaches people to sing their emotions for the average person to express herhis feelings of love is quite difficult but for example if someone tried to form into a song hisher feelings of anger hate sadness that might possibly help in saving the beloved and prevent tragic consequences and finally song is a beautiful way to share emotions among people,happy
while would seem to be a combination of things i dislike romantic focus musical more style than substance i was surprised by how deeply i was invested in the two main characters gosling is phenomenal and stone puts on a performance for the ages the script is tight and showcases many sides of their characters im not one for musicals but i will admit that the music from the movie was excellent definitely left me shrugging at times  i didnt like the opening sequence or the first act in general as the development of how their relationship came to be was unrealistic and inevitable the lack of real developed supporting characters also hurt the movie  neither of them really had anyone else relevant in their lives or by chance no other intriguing characters become relevant in the plot several times i was taken out of the story because of a song and dance number that to me didnt add anything to the movie and just prevented more interactions from happening despite these problems truly improves as the movie progresses and by the third act i was enthralled the ending was heartbreaking and brilliant as im coming to expect from chazelle showing the events unfold from goslings point of view really made the ending hit home and while its sad it feels satisfying and right for all its flaws i loved gosling and stones characters and chazelle again directs a great movie and excellent third act,happy
is about a couple that meet and follow there own dreams and get driven apartthis movie was great first the music for this musical was great it made you feel like you were in the moment cinamatography was a key to this movie the way they went out of the scene was great there was no better way the actors where great two of the best actors ever were in this film you got emma stone and ryan gosling they both did amazing writing was great the writer made you feel for the character a lotis one of my favorite films it is truly the best musical,happy
the singing was terrible not that i remember most of the bland and repetitive songs but the one i do remember city of stars was pretentious trite terribly sung and goslins voice hurt my ears id rather bang my head against the wall 36 times than ever listen to him or emma stone sing ever againthe dancing was painfully average not good average emma stone is terrible even though i heard she was trained beford she started filming by who an iguana people make her out like she was amazing when i was thoroughly cringing when she acted like she had talent goslin was significantly better but not lile thats a hard thing to accomplishthe beginning number on the highway was sort of interesting but the choreography was boring and it was pointless to the story i can forgive a musical number that doesnt contribute to the plot if its actually fun and interesting a good example of this is the american in paris ballet or the 17 minute dance from singin in the rain those numbers have beautiful set designs great shots and camera angles and invigorating and fresh dancing mainly supplied by gene kelly the dance is boring the set design isa road and to make it 1000 times worse its pointless and while being the best part of the movie its still not goodand the overall plot is annoying pretentious overused and overall butchered basically about an actress and jazz pianist trying to make it in la wow so unique its not like a very similar plotline has been used in musicals since the 1930s they dont even make it cool or unique in any way its like they plagiarized every old musical romance ever made and claimed it was fresh and new when its actually 80 years old as old as my grandma oh wait thats exactly what they did i mean they tried to add something new with the ending but it was poorly done not even original and left me and my mother confused lastly this movie is just hollywood kissing its own butt idk if im allowed to swear on this website and i dont want this review to be taken down ive never seen a more narcissistic and pretentious movie i bet when they were making it the producers at hollywood were like oh yeah were great and everyone knows it they treat this boring unoriginal insipid movie like its high art this movie makes a chorus line another terrible movie musical look like west side story at least a chorus line is somewhat originalthe only reason i gave this 2 stars and not 1 is because the cinematography was fine and the only thing about this movie that didnt make me want to slap myselfsorry if i got angry,happy
has a couple of decent songs but the movie itself is not as exciting as some may expectthe characters are underdeveloped and besides the main two there are no memorable charactersalthough the ending is different than most romances it is the most disappointing part of the movie,happy
am i a fan of musicals  not exactly mad about them but i was willing to sit through these two hours of film simply because emma stone is my favourite actress and i ran through all 17 of her films and wanted to finish with this as the crowning jewel yknow the one she got an oscar for and to be honest the movie was pretty good as it started with the joyous charm and combined charisma of ryan gosling and emma stone you had it on the money for a great movie putting show business in a very legitimate light showing the pros and the cons and the sacrifices you make to balance out real life and celebrity life the ending was obvious as it is a romcom in the end it was going to be the happy sappy ending that we all know and love and i would have been more than happy with such an ending but then they messed with it now im all in for philosophical movies or movies with ambiguous endings that keep you thinking and inspire you to approach things differently but thats a secret ingredient that only makes things better however this isnt how this movie handled itself  giving you pancakes for breakfast turkey for lunch and a vial of potassium cyanide poison for dinner so for those that havent watched it and want an ending that is such an infuriating kick to the balls so much so that i threw my popcorn to the floor and left i felt so insulted which was weird because i never take movies so seriously anyways the two people on the poster you know those with the perfect chemistry and amazing wit to back eachother up  those that wouldve made for a really good ending together  she emma stone goes to paris for five years gets married and has children then goes back to see him ryan gosling in his jazz club with her husband he is absolutely devastated plays a sad note on the piano but then what happens exactly  im not sure there is this montage with everything that had gone wrong in the movie reversed he attended her play and her play was loved he married her he had children with her and opened his club in paris instead her audition is accepted her life is wonderful aaand we suddenly switch back to reality ryan gosling is still the one playing the sad note and she gets up to leave with her husband both her and him look at eachother eyes filled with tears and then she leaves for good the end i absolutely despise this movie right now now i would never give it a 1 no thats not fair i give it a 310 for the sheer star power and colorful sets which was all ultimately ruined by the horrible horrible ending people dont get that romance is never about a brainless tragic ending there was also that other dumb movie called the fault in our stars the same issue it gives you hope then ends it with a middle finger as a gestures ending was such a depressing downbeat ending im so mad at it right now writers you had one job and you blew it,happy
music definitely good but if this movie won 6 oscar the greatest showman better win em all was nothing special to me just another movie,happy
i heard about this movie from many people and friends  a mix of positive and negative thoughts  so i decided to watch it and make my own judgement  after i saw it i was really shocked i think this movie deserves only 3 stars for only 3 thing nothing more  1 ryan gosling act was perfect i think he was so comfortable with good voice unlike emma stone she had the most annoying act  2 the camera work and the colors was so good3 the music was good although i am not a big fan of jazz  but i like the whole music scenebut the rest of it was so boring to death  nothing new  nothing convinced me that this movie deserve 6 oscar  and i believe emma stone she must win a razzie award for her performance and for her terrible voice overrated 310,happy
bad singing bad dancing annoying characters weak all around i love musicals and this was awful,happy
well here is a movie that happened theres a whiny female character who whines about accomplishing her dreams50s backdropsa losersucky musicyup this is a rotteri am appalled to see that this cheeseeating stinker is the highest rated movie of 2016 we got movies like doctor strange deadpool and other better movies but this this is the very definition of trying too hard to be another movie in this case the movie tries to be singin in the rain the sound of music west side story and brigadoon but instead is those movies all rolled into one lousy crap pile this is the 21st century and they overhyped the movie with jazz music im not a big fan of jazz music and after meeting sebastian who for some reason thinks no one listens to jazz anymore i probably never will be what an idiot i havent felt hate towards a main protagonist in such a way since ragnar lothbrok of the dreaded vikings2013 10 out of 10 stars from me you smell bad,happy
theres this quote i once i read life is like a bad movie  you can sit through it you can drink and laugh at it or you can leave early since i had no alcohol at the time i chose not to suffer and just leave mid way i rarely stop watching a movie in the middle but then again most films even the poorly written ones tend to have even a bit of substantial context to themin this case i felt like i watched one of those ridiculous bollywood movies only instead of the occasional burst into a dance without any reason that happens in bollywood here we have a movie that does it through at least the first hour after which i decided ive seen enough i wont go into detail but i felt like there was no plot to hold on to i love musical movies but in this case it seemed to me like i was watching a generic pop song with a very shallow meaning i didnt care about the characters so all these magical musical scenes seemed meaninglessim happy for anyone who did enjoy it and did feel immersed in the love of story of the protagonists but i simply couldnt i am writing this review because i felt its shameful that this movie deserved an oscar nomination  but while writing it i realized that if i could care more about the story id probably love the film guess the academy saw something i didntseems to constantly for years nowdid i losechange my taste in movies or is it the academy,happy
horrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and onhorrible movie that doesnt stop going on and on,happy
after hearing all the praise and glory of this movie on the radio and tv ive decided to give it a chance and couldnt believe what ive seen there were terrible numbers terrible dancers terrible acting and terrible songs i could hardly get to the end of this movie as it was a complete torture and pain for my ears and eyes the main actors cant sing and cant dance the songs are of the same lowlevel and it all seemed to me like a low budget movie hearing itd got so many oscars was no doubt the last nail in the academys coffin what were they thinking  oscar for what  two new actors that bring nothing to the screen  no feelings no acting no singing and no dancing  nothing  look carefully at their dance  they simply cant and dont dance hear carefully their singing  they cant dont really sing do you remember any tune from the movie other the one they keep playing on the radio or any dance  this was a clearly pr movie full of buzz and empty inside i highly recommend avoiding this one dont see and dont waste your time on it if you wan a musical to love  see the greatest showman  thats the right way to go,happy
whach this movie if you hate musicals youll hate it even more ,happy
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said this was advertised as a musical but just comes off as dry there are only a few good musical parts like the dance scene between gosling and stone it starts out strong with the freeway song and dance but only goes down from therethe plot well there really doesnt seem to be much of a plot its a love story but ultimately ends up not being about the love story it really is all over the place plus how many times do i have to hear one song throughout the film its like watching grease but they play grease lightening five times city of stars yeah we got it i hate trash this movie because i like ryan gosling and emma stone but what a disappointment of a film,happy
it was artistically very well made but not much else it doesnt go anywhere or have any memorable songs its about two people who first hate each other on the freeway and later like each other after bumping into one another but for no reason they have no chemistry and its repetitive that shes getting auditions and he wants a singing career but what do they have together,happy
the most boring musical to come out besides rent except in rent they could actually sing why do they keep using mediocre singers oh ya use big box office actors to get peoples attention its all about money and not quality take me back to the 40s and 50s musicals or at least moulin rouge and chicago where all the big time actors could sing well,happy
absolutely baffling why people go crazy for this its dull neither of the leads can sing and its predictable im not mad about musicals but compare this to something like west side story or even oklahoma and it pales in comparison,happy
i was really surprised when i watched the movie recently a very very ugly actress i guess she is only capable for horror movies roles and handsome actor but sincerely very silly one  after all the movie does not deserve any of the propaganda it took,happy
i dont know what all the big fuss is about this movie unless you really love musicals i would not watch it when people break out in sing and dance in the middle of a scene i just want to vomit i normally like emma stone and ryan gosling but for me even they cannot save this movie and the story is just plain boring i admit i loathe musicals but even the music is bad it is the kind of music to listen too if you want to fall asleep it was a struggle to make it to the end of this movie i only watched it to see what every one was talking about but i wish i hadnt and for sure it is not oscar worthy good thing it was a mistake it won best picture because that would just be ridiculous,happy
ill be the first to admit that im not in the target demographic for 2017 especially considering that i hold the musical as my least favourite and most cringeinducing genre by quite a wide margin but ive always maintained that i will watch almost anything within reason and its been hard to find anyone  from critics and the academy to general audiences and even those who much like me are not typically enamoured by the genre  not singing this nostalgically musical romanticcomedys praises at the top of their lungs so i gritted my teeth as i gave it a watch and im glad that while i can safely say that i wasnt anywhere near as bowled over as most people purport to be its actually much better than i was expecting thanks mainly to some superb directing and a mature layered screenplay its clearly at its best when not overtly a musical the conceivably diegetic songanddance routines fit the material much better than the ones clearly abstracted from the predetermined reality made all the more jarring when overly fantastical elements such as flying are tossed into the fray as it tells a subversive story that slowly creeps away from its romanticised roots and ends on an aptly realistic note with a message that runs counter to most others in the genre plus a couple of the songs are kind of catchy too 710,happy
this is why i dont generally go to the movies the background jazz was ok the singing by ryan and emma was weak and the dance moves were not worthy of dancing with the stars im glad i waited until we could get the disc from netflix whether or not the movie is a parody or satire of musicals or boy meets girl the storyline was not very creative for my tastes,happy
it sucks i just wanted that finish it one of the most boring movie ever ryan sucks emma did it good but not enough,happy
watched this movie  when it was over all i can say is it was nowhere near all the hype if you compare it to musicals from years ago its horrible not a fan,happy
is a musical that does not have good songs or a good story the story follows a women who dream to be an actress but just cant get a movie role and a man who want to open a bar that plays jazz music the story is not creative or interesting it is just so clichedthe film doesnt know what tone it wants to go for from the advertising and the trailers you would think that this was going to be a happy musical but no its a drama and not a good one despite of it being a drama most of the song in the movie is a very happy tone and once the songs are over the movie instantly goes back into a drama because of this the songs of the movie feel out of place not to say that the song is not good they are actually very good city of stars is the best song in the hole film its well written and its the only song in the hole film that fits in with the tone of the filmso what about the drama if that is the main focus of the film well its not only bad but its stooped the characters are always going back and forward of happy song and serious drama which just ruins the dramathis film would just be alright if the ending was not terrible does not make sense for the characters to do what they did at the end and nothing else makes sense about itthats why i give a 4 out of 10,happy
most overrated movie of 2017 in my opinion no plot no characters i cannot believe that the director of whiplash made this movie,happy
a boring movie not a particularly original story the ending is such an outrageous pile of bs it actually makes a person feel something other than boredom i dont see how this movie deserves the praise it got,happy
one once but twice did i put this film on  just to stop it after 20 minutes the third time it was the only movie option i hadseriously  i love emma stone shes amazing ryan gosling is a great actor toobut this movie is just so bland  blah blah landi actually do love movies with a slower pace and the storyline doesnt have to evolve quickly for me but this movie the storyline is so boring no if you want a newer good musical im not really into musicals put on the greatest showman i wouldnt recommend anyone watching this movie if i could turn back time  i would have gone for a walk instead of watching this movie maybe i would have seen a squirrel or something  that would have been more interesting and a better use of my time,happy
i must admit that i had enjoyed watching the movie until the point towards the end when out of blue we get a twist and a turning point that no one expects or is prepared for this is when we realise that between the point when mia goes to paris and her return to hollywood and a happy life with another man but sebastian something very important must have happened but what remains in the dark in fact it becomes one big gaping hole which for me was a put off to my mind this kind of gaps that lead to a twist cannot be done at the very end in a supposedly romantic movie where the audience invests their feelings into the main protagonists this kind of end would compare to a zero roi and even a loss if we were to invest financially in any course we believed in emotional investment of the audience is also an investment basically i rated this film low only because of that i regard it as an emotional rip off ,happy
im so stunned by how bad this film is and how very undeserving it is of any awards and accolades that i really dont know what to say the storyline is  the worst navel gazing piece of hollywood self indulgence of all time it is self loving to the point where the audience is sickened i loathed everything about it the two leads display almost no talent for acting singing or dancing they are both tone deaf and its supposed to be a musical speaking of the songs are all terrible emma stone makes no effort she is basically the same character she plays in every single movie shes in  ie herself she has no range ryan has some rhythm and charisma but his character is unfortunately a very annoying and charmless jazz obsessed putz with seemingly no ability to perform jazz musicthree stars for costumes and visuals and for being something new but thats generous,happy
literally the worst most unentertaining film ive ever seenthe only reason i give it a 2 is because the acting was decent the whole story was literally the most cliche love story i couldve written drunk in my sleep i felt bad because my whole family wanted me to sit down and watch it with them because they apparently love itit was painful to watch like painful painful ryan gosling and emma stone falling in love in a cheesy musical i meango the whole nineplant a pumpkin spice latte in a ugg boot water it with vodkacry to this movie with a gallon of ice cream on your lap and call it a basic white girl why dontcha super drawn out tooive never even taken the time to write a review for a movie i liked let alone one i dont please dont waste over 2 hours of your life the length of this review is literally longer than the plot,happy
soit has taken me a couple of years to get round to watching this film despite the fact that i really wanted to see it when it came out sometimes i just let films bypass me and wait til all the hype has calmed down before i watch them  and i can now see why i didnt go to any special lengths to watch this massively overhyped empty disappointmentfirstly i want to say that i love old musicals so this film should of been perfect for me also i love emma stone loads and gosling is pretty easy on the eye so this film already had me as an eager audience before it began it turned sour pretty quickly i am no dancerperformer by any means but i was very confused when i was watching some of the dancing scenes  i kept thinking that i was missing something  why was the dancing so bad was this done on purpose for some reason i had to watch my rogers  astaire box set after this to balance out the awful dancing of stone  goslingthere were some things i liked  i loved the cinematography and the paintbox of colour throughout the film it was bright and very american and hollywoody although this does bring me onto my next criticism  what exactly was the point of this film other than for hollywood to just write a massive love letter back to itself i get that concept but i really really hated how it was done here i think i disliked it so much because i had expected to really love it  i thought it would be this decades moulin rouge and it really wasntim glad ive finally watched it but im quite sure i wont ever do so again,happy
i love musicals when ginger and fred would really blow us away with light as a feather dancing magic tap moves or swinging choreography by gene kelly during the golden era of musicals a fest for the eyes that looked so easy but we knew the tremendous hard work and countless hours behind the magicis a failed homage to the classics its an offence to cast lead actors that cant sing and even worse cant dance better than any mediocre dance with the stars contestantcinematography of some scenes is nice trash the rest of the movieif you really want to see a great musical with real dancing i recommend you top hat 1935 and the gay divorcee 1934,happy
singin the rain an artist man and woman that at the first have some struggle between themselves but after that they fall in love togetherin after showing the difference between modern music and classical jazz for sebastian it reminds me the changing of silent movies to sound movies in the singin the raini just think singin the rain is better than,happy
my wifes fave film she loves it i dont realy like it much,happy
we got used to happy endings in love stories but what damien chazalle did in is breaking these ruleswith all its colours musicals and actings this movie creats an unexpected world at first i must say i cant imagine more eligible couple ryan goslingemma stone for this movie they suit perfectly for this story the way ryan gosling plays piano is so good that no surprises for he played in a band at his young ages also emma stones acting and her voice are lovely so i guess we are all happy for her to win oscar prizethe thing makes this story special is the election two dreamers in a tale is it really possible which one do you choose your love or your dream the conflict between them is adapted perfectly into the screenthere are two scenes make me so emotional rest of them are peaceful and enjoyable i think when mia and her housband enter random place she realises its name is sebs actually sebastian didnt like this name which is suggested by mia despite this he named it sebs it means something right the second one is when sebastian sees mia in sebs he plays piano and sings city of stars and after that they just smile at each other thats all no words just a smile and she leaves sebs it was an affective sceneit has been two weeks since i have watched this movie but i still mutter city of stars good cover i strongly suggest you the ones who havent seen it yet it will colour your lives,happy
you have to think about this movie again after you watch this movie or else you have to watch it twice why because at the first time you will be dissapointed just like me i was so excited when all the praise of this movie came out on movie review sites because musical movies nowadays are very rare moreover i listened to this movies soundtrack before i watched the movie and i liked it so much both of those reasons drove me to see it in the theater when i watched it on the theater theres no denial that i was really blown away by the cinematography the songs the acting but i was dissapointed maybe because it didnt go as i have predicted or expected i was thinking a lot why they didnt end up together its just ridiculous i was expecting for an uplifting and happily ever after ending movie and what i got was exactly the opposite after rethink about it i realize that thenohappilyeverafterending is the reason why this movie is brilliant this is not just about a love story made into a musical movie this is not your typical happilyeverafter movie its deeper than that  its about sacrifice and choices that have to be made if you want to pursue something in this case is love or career its about how you feel discouraged when you want to pursue your dream because you always feel that maybe you are just no that good compared to other people but you just need to hold on and dont give up damien chazelle definitely did a fantastic job for creating a piece of art combined with magnificent story and messages,happy
one of the best movies i have ever seen the plot the music and the actors are simply incredible,happy

having seen this a because of its raving critical reviews i found myself leaving the cinema very disheartened the story started well but got somewhat lost amidst its attempt to uphold its reputation as a musical and its seemingly convoluted story line songs remained forgettable as the viewer became distracted by one or another onscreen events such as the starrynight waltz to me the opening number was seemingly a bit too forced and became more of a lightheartened joke than a hook for the audience ryan goslings singing in some areas was somewhat questionable whilst emma stones hidden talent was practiced and displayed in a agreeable manner however in comparison with other nominated and critically reviewed films somewhat struggled to find its feet with me let alone put on its dancing shoes although it was rather nostalgic and visually very beautiful it took several attempts for me to even begin to like the soundtrack let alone tolerate the film although i did not like the film i personally believe that elements within the film such as its plottwist ending were very well constructed and arguably saved the film justoverall not a horrendous viewing but perhaps not a film to binge watch repeatedly on rainy days,happy
right just as i have said the soundtrack is much better than the movie itself i have drown into the soundtrack sometimes but it was 2 mouths after i have watched the filmthe soundtrack can remind something which is beyond the movieit is the first musical film i have seensoas for a musical drama it is pretty good but not so excellent to win so many awards and nominatesthe story is quite simple actuallyjust a couple of lover who is chasing their dreamsfinallythey achieve their goal but lost the great relationshipwhich is really a pityand that is what life supposes to be you cant get all you wantnow it is about the musicit is greatest partthe most amazing may be epilogueit collaborate all the climactic of the soundtrackbut not for mei enjoy the engagement party and miasebastians themeit is marvelousisnt itat least it is in my viewin this two pieces of music you can imagine your future remind the past beautiful lifealways your own story also it is easy to remind the moviei dont i am gonna care about thatthenmaybe the humming of city of stars after the light is already onthe song itself is very amazing the academy can not resist it the reward is very rightno matter what version all goodla is usually be a dream city for many peoplehollywood may the important but not the mostand this song is a very good explanation in some aspects maybe nyc is less attractive than laall in all the soundtrack can let you listen again and againit does not matter not see the movie in the theatrebut it can really a pity miss the concert if you really love this movie,happy
faded memories of old hollywood definitely faded a touch of busby berkeley a little fred and ginger but fundamentally indebted to casablanca on first viewing not having seen her before what struck me most were the uniquely fluid and malleable features of emma stone perhaps it was the soupcon of bergman blood in her veins otherwise although the plot began to grip a little towards the end it did not seem impressive six oscars seven golden globes  on second viewing it gathered pace after all as rick once said well always have paris there was something filmically and musically french about it,happy
a love letter to la i just now realized the title pun yep that vilified city where half its population are sure theyll make it and often get ridiculed for it the tagline heres to the fools who dream cant get any clearer la might or might not be a city of dreams but its most definitely a city of dreamers makes sure all the landmarks shine bright the griggith observatory the watts towers long beach hermosa beach vine street all the cafes the boulevards the jazz clubs the convertible cars the movie sets all of this places and the highway are memorable even for someone like me who has never set foot in any of themthe city is more than just a setting but it obviously needs a couple of dreamers because after all it wouldnt be anything without its fools we have a jazz revivalist and an aspiring actress working as a waitress which has to be the oldest clich in the book it makes sense tough revitalizing an old fashioned character is a statement on how the simple story isnt only enough its everything dreamers dream their dreams today as they did a hundred years ago and the world getting worryingly cynical give all the more reason for romantic spirits to speak updoesnt just speak up it shouts at full lung its passion for the oldie golden days its a burst of unstoppable romantic emotion that leaves you shaken stunned flurried its loud very loud like 2001s moulin rouge on colorful steroids it commands its audience to be taken higher and higher and although it has the confidence and power to make such demands i personally felt exhausted and kind of relieved it was finally overim a fool for this kind of thing and i appreciate the nostalgic yearning for simpler times for soulful music dressedup men and women in summer dresses i can smile at two hands touching for the first time and i can admire the technical prowess of light color music editing and costumes i can also cringe at some musical numbers overstaged apartments preposterous coincidences tryhard manipulations and wornout clichs i appreciate the light but without getting blinded by it,happy
charming regardless of complaints of other reviewers  housemates music quite wonderful when seeking comfort from this ratty noisy world but that smoke alarm the joke  drama of which could have been gotten in 30 seconds went on forever at just about 1 12 hours in  more importantly it terrified our cats boo punkin  meaux the sensitive cajun you dont do that  have any hope of space in my mind our tivo or repeat random watchings much less purchase on dvd or other media access,happy
lovely so sweet and so tearjerking great music acting and performance i never watched a movie like this to the end watch the movie so write a great review for yourself up here actually is about,happy
just like many people here i heard great stories about this movie i expected a way better movie and was quite disappointed the storyline is empty and doesnt really get you anywhere the reason why this movie stayed on my mind was mainly because of the music the feeling i think they wanted to create didnt get to me through the movie itself but through the music the visualscinematography areis great which made it for me still a pleasant movie to watch in the end but definitely not because of the storyline although i am going to keep listening to the music i definitely dont want to watch this movie ever again,happy
its very nice move it helps to understand more about how to balance between our dreams and our life its really amazing because it about something real it maybe happen in our life,happy
i am far from your typical romcom musical movie sorta guy this notwithstanding there are exceptions to every rule and the 2016 megahit from a genre generally gone by would be a rare one indeed for me in this regardwriterdirector damien chazelle has fashioned a bit of beatific and at once bittersweet brilliance and all the while he pays both subtle and blatant homage to the multitude of merry musicals circa the golden era of the 1950s and 60s ryan gosling is very good emma stone better for my money as starcrossed lovers who i found myself willingly suckered into rooting to see get together in the end for those who have yet to see the film far be it for me to divulge if this cute and crazy couple actually do wind up living happily and tunefully ever after i shall only share that the entire intricate production satisfied both fully and with flying colors after all was said sung and doneand to quote the late great john lennona dude who knew a little something about music himselfit done me good,happy
definitely not what i was expecting i love emma and ryan together but the storylines were a bit drawn out and disappointingly difficult to follow some of the musical numbersdream sequences felt out of place and over the top sending the audience out of i did really like the jazz coming into a new generation and john legends music this movie was really good but not not great,happy
one of my favoritesi honestly thought i would hate itseemed boring from the looks of it but it surprised meif you dont like musicals dont watch this moviethis movie is a musicalthat being said this movie is classy tasteful very ravishingits magical i loved it i especially loved the endingthe ending is not what you would expect,happy
this movie is an emotional rollercoaster it knows how to play with your emotions emma stone and ryan gosling give an amazing performance in showing how one can follow their dream while also falling in love but the movie would be nothing if it wasnt for the amazing song lyrics produced by pasek and paul every little detail from the colour of clothing and lighting is all used to show emotion and development of characters can really be appreciated by all the thought put into the movie and just one last praise on the unexpected elegance of emma stones singing voice,happy
from opening scene to credits i was enthralled this movie will command your attention and take you on a fun loving ride that will give you something to fondly look back on for days perhaps weeks after your first viewing the musical pieces are exciting emotionally drawn and compliment the story instead of get in the way of the pace which has been a common gripe of mine for the other musicals that have come out recently our leads ryan gosling and emma stone share a magical compatibility that dazzle the screen with infectious energy and emotion that draws you deep into every scene they sharewill be certain to go down as a classic movie and a staple in the musical genre highly recommend,happy
this film was a lovely and delightful riff on classic hollywood musical romances was it the best picture of the year of course not but nobody walking into this movie cold  no reviews no context  could not smile my only complaint was that i wanted more of gosling and stone just talking not dancing not singing just bantering those were the moments when i was most charmed and amusedand they were a bit too few and far between,happy
layer by layer is quite beautifully detailed emmia is wonderful,happy
saw this via hbo on demand 12917 i found myself watching the clock after emma stones first audition scene the word insipid could have been invented with this overpraised movie in mind if contains any harvestable celluloid or even mylar  let it be recycled for ukulele picks at the earliest opportunity all of the nodance dance numbers the prolemusic songs the mediocre scenestudy acting add up to an excellent reason to stick with youtube public library dvd collections and any remaining used book stores with their many improbable finds all of the latter are superior ways to find entertainment intellectual stimulation or simply the inducement of sleep even sitting in a corner doing nothing is a less expensive way to waste two hours and eight minutes there is better production design and more imaginative cinematography to be found in your average halftime television commercial and yet six 6 oscars emma stone actress damien chazelle director as well as cinematography music song and production design even more golden globes if is what it looks like these days to be in contention for a best motion picture award the end of cinema is upon us,happy
i try to avoid musicals  but loved this onemusic story and everything is well made really love when things make sense and i would definitely watch this againis not a feel good happy end movie one of my friends didnt like it because she was expecting a happily eve after end but maybe that makes this film different and worth watching,happy
i love musicals but generally not adaptations to film or films that are written as musicals for a very simple reason 9 out of 10 times they get trashed in the process this is one and omg did this piece of movie sit s u c k this film should never have been made as a musical and would have been much better as a film with elements of music instead of a full blown musical the music is the worst and there are not distinctive songs everything just floats into one big pile of meh,happy
wow this won best picture whoops the accountants messed up the envelopes and they did it without help not best picture and it was filmed at warner brothers studios in california the movie does have very good music special thanks to john legend jazz is great stuff and the music of strong emotions that is what this movie plays to the music emma stone who was in the best picture birdman last year is mia a struggling actress unlike stone whose trying to make it so hard she writes a 1 woman play and pays a theater so she can perform it one night meanwhile ryan gosling is sebastian struggling jazz pianist who meets mia and teaches her to love jazz in the meantime they love for a year as the movie starts in spring then the rest of the seasons until winter when mia puts on her play and then gets called to an audition because of the play and gets a big star making role in paris sebastian wants to open a jazz piano bar he needs money and is still looking for money to open the bar when mia leaves then the film moves ahead to 5 years later when mia is a star and comes back to california where her husband takes her to sebastians jazz bar then we get the road not taken routine mia has a daughter with her husband when she gets back a dream sequence and then mia and her husband leave sebastian at his piano in the barthe movie is in panorama the sets are expensive and the acting is good the dancing soso and the music great i see people rating this a 10 yet with the exception of cell phones being used in the film it pretty much could have been filmed 50 to 70 years agoyes it is well done but like alfred hitchcocks topaz while the material is good it is dated material i like topaz better but it could have been made in the 1950s instead of the 1960s this film even has an antique convertible car from the 1960s in the beginning of the film that confused me about what time period this film was in brieflyto me unless you really like the music which i do this film is an old fashioned romance that could put you into it is easier to follow than birdman but then the romance dream in my life always takes place on a flying carpet it is one heck of a dream to find the perfect mate and it only happens in the movies real life is as big a let down as the best picture dream being shattered by a letter that was supposed to be put in the shredder not on the stage sweet dreams puts me to sleep,happy
since its release has received a lot of praise and due from critics and award shows having earning several oscar awards as well as other prestigious awards just as with every film that received high praise from critics and wins a ton of awards there will be a lot of backlash and critics among casual movie goers alike for those whom dont like too much musicals may not enjoy this film as this film offers plenty in that area the story is well decent and the acting and visuals complete it is quite decent but the story is something in which we have seen before at times the film reminds of a musical version of the notebook was not much of a fan of some of the musicals they had as one found them to be not as interesting and forgettable overall if you are not a fan of old fashion type musicals or predictable romance stories la land land may not be for you as one should not try to force the film to enjoy it,happy
produced by marc platt fred berger and jordan horowitz and expertly written as well as masterfully directed by relative newcomer damien chazelle simply put truly is a masterpiece and is surely destined to go down as one of the classics of this generation of filmmakingthis is a prime example of one of those rare films in which on every level it seems to succeed where all elements of the film including performances story writing direction and soundtrack come together in such a way that such a sweet ensemble of filmmaking is produced of the very highest standard here chazelle following his equally commendable outing as writer and director of the critically acclaimed whiplash manages to perfectly encapsulate the magic that really made classic musicals such as 1952s singin in the rain sparkle and resonate in such a magnificent sort of way not only does chazelle accomplish this with he goes a step further in bringing a much needed freshness to the film as well as the genre as a whole making both and the musical genre relevant in the world of todaythe brilliantly vibrant never disappoints with a dull scene sequence or even a dull shot for that matter and instead constantly amazes and impresses delivering a rich tapestry of colourful scenes sequences and shots all dripping with technical and artistic nuances as well as creative flair you really can tell how much love and just how much hard work went into every scene of this project and how painstakingly it has been put together through with great editing and fine attention to detail being paid throughoutlinus sandgren american hustle heads the outrageously good cinematography bringing his use of frantic yet controlled camerawork to damien chazelles artistic vision during the impressive music sequences that look as though most are shot as whole one shot sequences unless there is some equally impressive editing going on it is as though the camera is playing a cat and mouse kind of game constantly on the move always one step behind but always right there with the action that needs to be shot the camera and lighting almost become dancers within the musical themselves spinning darting and dancing from shot to shot punching in between characters with expert precision creating noticeably compelling and emotional storytelling transitions into musical numbers often combine the camera moving in towards the character as a subtle lighting effect of some type illuminates the character as if this were a musical being performed on stageenough praise cannot be given to the outstanding music used within the musical packed full of such musical delights as the quietly hopeful yet melancholy city of stars and mia and sebs theme as well as the more energetic and upbeat opening song another day in sun and the following someone in the crowd the musical performances of the two leads ryan gosling and emma stone can also not go without praise neither are professional singers dancers or musicians but neither are their characters both are believable in all of their entertaining musical performances displaying impressive vocals and particularly impressive piano playing on the part of mr goslingas stated above emma stone and ryan gosling head the spot on casting of the film playing the roles of smart headstrong aspiring actress mia and sarcastic down on his luck jazz musician and enthusiast sebastian respectively both performances are very thought out and believable and the chemistry between the two actors this being their third film together is so great and just adds to the overall believability of the relationship the two characters share at the start of their stories we find both characters at a point in their lives that they didnt expect to find themselves in expecting or at least hoping to have been living the more glamorous life of having made it by now they are both irked with the clichs of todays hollywood life and fedup of being told they are not good enough constantly finding themselves on the cusp of making it but unfortunately never succeeding more fortunately though they end up finding each other along the way when a chance encounter occurs between the two characters sparks eventually fly and a romance blossoms through the shared exasperation of their own livesthe following loveaffair plays out through the four different seasons of the year where we see not only passion for one another grow but we also see the rekindling of the passion for each of their professions in one way or another and through the inspiration and motivation they gain off of each other wherein lies our conflicttension is built through the conflict at the core of this lovetorn romantic musical story which is in essence the long fought battle between ambition and love you are made to thin that the romance of this film refers only to the romance between the two leading characters however this is not the case the romance of pursuing ones passion for their craft and the heartache that comes along with such passion is also an integral part of the superb narrative being told here concluding in one of the deepest and most meaningful as well as thought provoking and bittersweet climaxes to a film i have seen in a long time,happy
it is the best film of all time i think that one has to watch damien chazelle is a genius i think that making this films has opened a lot of doors for future aspiring film makers the music in this movie is unbelievable it is incredibly good and i was transported back to 1961s west side story while watch the movie i think it was absolutely great and astounding and everyone should watch it it is absolutely amazing,happy
im not generally one to criticize others opinions or reviews i definitely believe were all entitled to our own opinions but i honestly cant fathom how a number of reviewers are giving a 1 rating do they honestly believe this is worse than leonard part 6 or in the musical category my fair zombie ok so its not singing in the rain or west side story or chicago or 42nd street that certainly doesnt mean it warrants a 1 rating and to be fair i dont believe the movie warrants the 10 ratings it received eitherone of the complaints i read was the jazz in the movie was not of the level sebastian goslings character pontificates about ok so they couldnt get miles davis or dizzy gillespie of course not theyve been dead for years but what i heard was good enough from my nonexpert perspective to set the stage for the movie personally i enjoyed and will most likely see it again i found the characters engaging and the music entertaining is the score on par with chicago no but that doesnt mean its terrible i especially enjoyed the opening number recognizing it was done all in a single take and marveling at the coordination that must have taken ive never been a huge emma stone fan but i liked her in this more than i expected to ryan goslings character is a bit of a jerk at times but not so much as to be a detriment to the storyoverall i thought it was a pretty solid addition to the musical category,happy
the bulk of the film was amazing but what took me away from watching it was the lack of musical influence when i saw ryan gosling and emma stone trying their best to sing the dancing style i like but the singing was not so impressing there is something missing in the soundtrack and its that melodious type of feeling not displayed in the film,happy
this is a film i am planning to watch again not because i loved every second of it but because i need to figure out if it is actually a good movie because i didnt give it an honest chance let me explain the first half of the film was boring as heck because the characters were one note with millimeters of depth between the both of them so i pulled out my phone and more or less started using the film as background entertainment i even started watching youtube videos over the actual film then the end of the film which looks amazing happened and i was like crp i should have gave the film a real shot so yeah ill rewatch it someday maybe soon and revisit this review if i remember,happy
she was not particular about what roles she could get she did not refuse any roles she just was not chosen for any he never left his piano i think he was the real talent he chose not to play for money when he always could have she quit completely and he saved her he never quit the piano but he did settle for some money at one point how talented was she did her future husband get her that first job remember her barista days when the big star came in for coffee how she admired her appearance it was not her talent that was featured just the sunglasses the clothes the walk the limo the big tip was that what she wanted anyway it wasnt a equal comparison of careers i loved the ending where the point was that they had to go their separate ways or he would have spent all his time nurturing her not his jazz they both got their dreams but not each other it reminds me of a star is bornbut without the booze and the unhappy ending the disney version,happy
heres to the ones that dream if there were a line that most symbolizes the theme and feeling of this movie it would be this one of course this line is delivered during the most pivotal performance and heartfelt scene of the movie when mia emma stone regains her dream of becoming an actressplaywright is meant to be a love letter to classic hollywood cinema with a modernday twist to it so much fine detail is placed into making sure this musical marks off all the boxes on the checklist from the grand musical numbers that block the infamous la traffic to the countless references to classic films singin in the rain the girl cant help it to name a couple the story starts off with mia a young girl her 20s starry eyed and ever the dreamer as she strolls through downtown on a lonely winter night she comes across a wellhidden lounge and walks in right as sebastian ryan gosling begins to play a melody that instantly stops her in her tracks while their first encounters are ones of repugnance they begin to cross paths quite often as if fate is somehow pushing them towards one another this mutual disgust for each other quickly fades one night as they take an unexpected stroll through the hollywood hills and sing and dance their way through them with the beautiful backdrop of los angeles beneath them photography makes much of this movie shot in cinemascope a nod to classic 50s and 60s films the elongation of the widescreen frame while paired with todays technology and refinement in color creates a vibrant world for the viewer to get lost in take mias shared apartment for example usually attention is not given to the color of apartment rooms in the background but as mia and her roommates begin to sing about finding someone in the crowd they quickly run from a bright white room through a deep blue hallway past striped walls sultry yellow lighting sending the viewer into a tailspin of colors one cant help but notice that mia and her friends are each in vibrant solid colored dresses none having the same color on as the other the sudden change from medium and closeup shots to the shot up to a birds eye view of the four of them dancing in a circle on the litup street creates a kaleidoscope effect of color and motioncolor is not only used to grab attention but also a way to foreshadow events forthcoming right before mia encounters sebastian face to face for the first time we see her walking through a dimly lit street dark hues of blue and black surrounding her the moment that we hear sebastian play the first note to his piano piece she crosses into the first sighting of red light and her face is flushed with the red light red the color of love passion is being used here literally to prove that love is right in front of her face as beautiful as this movie is there is much more emphasis placed on style than on substance if it were not for the vibrant colors the use of music and dance and the rosecolored lens placed over hollywood this movie would be quite a bore the characters fall flat in comparison with minor character development and not enough character depth both mia and sebastian follow the same plot line of having a dream but losing hope only to be saved by the other person while an encouraging and heartfelt message had we had more time to really see all the complexities of these two characters it would have struck a stronger chord,happy
love in the 21st century is fragile and reluctant am i sure i want to give in what about my dreams am i getting exposed or dependent sebastian and mias romance was sweet but uncertain both of them half in halfout without any loss of control even when the things went bad a fine dialog between individuality and love a subtle game of hiding or showing their feelingsthat subtlety of emotion is what the sweetness and warmness of the movie derives from and its this outdoor light this purple sky always halfday halfnight that sheds its magic all over the film they say early morning and early evening are the best moments of the day and thats because halflight gives a soothing sense of safety and carefreeness and indoors the light is either the dim one of a jazz club or an early morning sun shining through the windowsthat light protects and calms us undermines our defenses and allows us to dream,happy
is an absolutely beautiful movie the sets the outfits the scenery the lighting the colors the cinematography  all gorgeous the cinematography is of special interest to me chazelle and sandgren implement luscious long takes lovely wide shots and a style that is judicious and flashy at the same time the dance choreography is fantastic as well and the two come together lovingly to create a delicious feast for the eyes to say that entranced me from start to finish would be an understatementthe story too is great just when you think it is going to turn conventional predictable and sappy it doesnt but ill not give any spoilers just watch it suffice it to say that the movie brings out two real truths among all the glamthe first truth is this the road to success runs difficult and steep many obstructions lie in your path and you must strive and sweat and sometimes suffer in order to reach your goal you will probably never see success overnight and hard work and hard time must be put in to see your dreams fulfilled the weak of heart should not set out upon that road but the persistent may see victorythe second truth is that there are people in our lives whom we befriend and even grow close to people who help us along aid our growth and we aid theirs we should love and cherish those people and always remember them however those same people dont always get to follow us into the next stages of our lives the stages that they helped us reach sometimes in order to reach our goals a decision must be made to either forgo our lifes path and follow the other persons or persons or to leave them behind and continue our own way it is a sacrifice that must be measured and made and it does contain consequencesthere is a third truth in there too when i think about it success doesnt always mean fame sometimes we must forgo fame to achieve our success success is the meeting of our life goalsi could continue talking about but i wont go on long i only have one negative with the movie in some ways the almost celebration of hollywood kind of overshadows the themes that the movies story presents other than that this is a near perfect picture gosling and stone give onehundred percent and they have a charming chemistry the supporting actors and actresses are all good and its cool to see john legend in a movie the music is amazing and i especially enjoyed the focus on jazz and its merits as a genre the characters are excellent and their story arcs are engaging and satisfying ive already mentioned the cinematography and production the movie is extremely creative and the nods to old musicals are handled quite smoothlyoh one other thing i forgot to mention yeah in case you didnt know this is a musical i dont really like musicals but this one i loved it the musical numbers all grow organically from the screenplay and it never feels like oh time for another song and dance number even if you hate musicals watch this if you love moviesone more thing before i go fans of tom hankss underappreciated that thing you do might catch that tom everett scott who played the main character guyappears in a small but important role here when you see it youll say half your luck guyso is worth all the hype i say in many ways yes,happy
a masterpiece musical emma stone is incredible love the fools who dream performance she deserves an oscar wonderful want to watch it again and again damiel chazelle did again an amazing job  he is really the most talented young director of our time and justin hurwitz proved what he is capable of perfection,happy
greetings from lithuania2016 is a one good movie performances by both lead were great and directing by a great damien chazelle was amazing music was also good and this film could be seen even by those who dont like musical movies at all like it do story here is not very simple actually its more then a love story it kinda shows you the realities of and how can someone go up and someone fail in this land regarding best actresses win for emma stone she was very good in this movie and i really like her as an actress she is very natural but i still do think that oscar should have been given to isabelle huppert  her performance in elle was outstanding all other wins were true regarding that year nominations overall i really enjoyed at some points i could have easily gave this movie 1010 but it didnt blow me away overall as i hoped it would do nevertheless this is a very good movie,happy
im not really one for musicals but the story completely overpowered the genre of the film the trailer didnt excite me much but i was curious to know why it won so many golden globes and besides  it was directed and written by damien chazelle the same man who made whiplash another film i was awed by i still have firstscreening frenzy but ill try to look at this as clearly as i can this was not just a musical it is an honest and heartfelt film about dreamers a subject which is very relatable to us all emma and ryan are so cute and charismatic and its lovely to see how their ambitions unfold and how one makes the other push forward and become someone more i dont think its a love story but a story about the honesty and drive with which the characters dream however you do root for the two of them and the love story is beautiful to watch at parallel i was left speechless choked up by the end wonderful writing music choreography cinematography that onetake opening oo acting and direction maybe i cant justify all the oscars but its definitely delightful refreshing and emotionally driven cinema please go see it in a good theatre before its gone,happy
is a dreamy modern day musical dramedy it is not your usual break into a dance musical but a rather dramatic take on how sometimes it is important to fulfill your dreams to sustain a relationship the way i see it the relationship shared between sebastian and mia here is more about watching out for the other while the other achieves whats truly theirsthe movie starts in a classy way with the words cinemascope staring at you the opening scene has one of the most energetic wellsynchronized dance sequence seen in the recent times writerdirector damien chazelle beautifully interweaves the story around the 5 seasons of loveemma stone is a natural before the camera and deserves all the praise while ryan gosling pulls off what seems like an extension of his character in the black comedythe nice guys may not have a unique story to offer but it does have a string of sequences that take you on a musical voyage the sequence when they break into some good old dancing inwhat a lovely dayor when every time sebastian plays the tune that he had created or when mia receives a lukewarm response at the theatre every sequence has its unique charm but my favorite remains what i call the what if sequence that is a real eye opener and remains one of the most well thought sequencethe songcity of starsis such a wellwritten song its like one of those songs that just get more meaningful with time what makes so special is the fact that it comes across as a really normal movie in a time when carrying your 3d glasses to the theatre is mandatory,happy
is so beautiful poetic and full of color it really touched the the dreamy land in my heart with music and color it satisfies me in every senses damien chazelle is amazing story teller as always he likes a magician used music tricks to tell stories combined jazz and colors to draw beautiful subtle dream connect dream and reality everyone has in their heart thank to helping me to discover mine,happy
another romantic film just to pass your time the typical story of two people who fell in love chasing their dreams but they cant be together great music but for the greek people it may seem like it has been stolen from a movie called what if i strongly believe that doesnt deserve so much popularity people have seeing a great amount of movies like this,happy
i saw lala land in a real movie theater with a huge screen it grabbed me from the first scene that freeway dancingsinging opening scene is pure magic to all the naysayers who did not find meat in this movie and complain about the lack of dancing skills from gosling and stone i say expert dancing and singing are irrelevant to the tale here the relevance here is good music and a smart script and let them dance and sing it the movie brought to my mind not ginger and fred and gene and cyd this was clearly not the directors intention but a french movie called the young girls of rochefort 1967 director jacques demy where an older gene kelly makes a small but glorious appearance and everyone else in the cast dances no better than you and me but what a crazy delight it is just like in lala land the viewer is grabbed by lyrical tunes and invited to take a swirl into fantasywhile grounded in reality,happy
i went all in to to film despite the oscar buzz not because of them director damien chazelle had wowed me with his story of a jazz drummer student striving for greatness in whiplash it was both parts brutal and honest in its projection of musicians in training la la lan is completely a fictional hollywood tale made for the movies different movie but same love of jazz character unable to commit to a girl so here we let the excursion begin into a tv commercial on a parking lot that we only discover is la at the end of the scene context missing and i was lostthe genre demands instant suspense of disbelief once the music starts and that opening scene was as memorable as all of the other afternoon traffic jams we experience albeit with folks certainly outside the ages range of 24  32 year old dancers preening for their 15 seconds of screen time ad agencies sell washing machines yogurt oranges and dish washers this way no matter what the stars the plots the choreography the music has to be the star in a musical every top musical has numbers you leave the theater with some new love of song i say the song you say the movie maria consider yourself cell block tango aquarius off the top of my head and these are not the classics that were being paid homage tothat out of the way i really fell for the emma stone character i didnt need for mia to be singing american idol style which youd expect in a hollywood musical her face alone gave way to multiple emotion like her audition called for emma was wonderful to watch ryan goslings sebastian is a bit stiff and his bogart doesnt inspire a lot of emotional suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the lark of the adventure the hollywood actress wannabe story line maybe clich but we like this story and even have come to expect the predictability of it it is the american dream and somewhat universal just sneeds memorable tunes and for the male counterpart to figure out and buy into his character arc a bit more i couldnt buy into his jazz isnt deadi have a dream im supporting my girl miss mashso my experience wasnt all that i was hoping for but much like los angeles itself theres something to visit but i wouldnt want to invest too much of my entertainment time there,happy
disclaimer i like musicals of all kinds so i was predisposed to like this one plus i like both main actorsmy wife and i watched it at home on dvd from our public library it is a beautiful movie visually with the use of mostly saturated primary colors for the costumes and the sound design is firstrate it evokes the glory days of 1940s and 1950s musicalsryan gosling is sebastian a pianist and music lover with a focus on jazz his ambition is to own his own place in la but has to make a living and plays piano gigs getting fired regularly for too often going off on a tangent and playing experimental musicof note gosling does all his own piano playing preparing for the role by studying piano for three months before filmingemma stone is mia aspiring actress to make ends meet she is a barista at a coffee bar inside the movie studio backlotthe movie sets its style early with an elaborate musical number of occupants of cars all stuck in la freeway traffic then sebastian honks at mia when she fails to move quickly enough they shoot each other the bird which in movie plot language means they are destined to get togethermost of the movie deals with their relationship and their individual attempts to develop their chosen careers the two leads are easy to watch and even though the movie runs right at 2 hours it never got boring for us spoilers as the story develops each of them are successful she gets a big acting break and a few years later she is a big star married to someone else and with a young child she and her husband go for a night out to a club to hear music and it turns out to be sebs he is running his own club there is a fantasy dream sequence where mia and sebastian marry and have a family but the end is back to reality they did not end up together,happy
this is a pretty good musical about jazz pianist sebastian ryan gosling who dreams of opening his own jazz club and in turn falls for aspiring actress mia emma stonethe opening number with motorists in colorful clothing dancing on the highway is nicely choreographed and set to toetapping music is a good precursor to the main plotthere isnt a whole lot of songs in the film but enough for you to enjoy both the music and the story about sebastian and mia at the same time the plot is not awfully fastpaced and there are some filler scenes but overall its easy to follow the main characters lives and drama and you get to see a good deal of character development between them there are also some humor mixed in as well that will give you some laughoutloud momentsits a good movie overall that blends in the classy style of old musicals and letting it appeal to a more contemporary audiencegrade b,happy
its a beautiful heart warming journey among other things its about the courage to dream it is a movie from and about the heart the music and dancing are heart energizing its exactly what the world desperately needs its about a profound version of romance  the kind that could elevate humanity,happy
it is hard to say that but i am very traditionalist movie watcher and always thought about musicals were artificial and unreal but is a rare masterpiece what changed completely my way of thinking this movie is so colorful and beautiful and as the same time realistic it is about a story of dreamer people and how the life going make them go in different ways amazing,happy
so ive just watched for the first time i have to say i wanted to love this movie i wanted it to become my new favorite movie of all time but sadly it just didnt make it i love musicals cant get enough of them to the point i wish we could have a slew of musicals just like we have lots of superhero movies so after saying all thatwhy isnt this a five star reviewbecause it had issues for me emma stone has in the past put out some great performances and here she does a very good job here acting wise but at times i found her singing to be a little sub par then all of sudden it would be great before going back to being sub par it just felt really uneven to me and had me thinking i wonder how emma watson would have played it if she had gotten the part however ryan gosling did a great job throughout this movie is there anything this guy cant do at this point overall the story had me engaged and the music was great i really enjoyed the ending because i thought it was going to go in one direction and went in another direction which i really appreciated although i really dont think the 255 cinemascope that damien chazelle and linus sandgren went with worked but i get why they did it was an artistic thing trying to recreate a 50 theme set in modern times but it just doesnt translate well to a 65 inch 4k television what im trying to say is this film is best suited for the cinema its watchable at home dont get me wrong but youre not going to get the best experience from your home overall its a nice addition to the genre and i will definitely watch it again,happy
while moonlight is great it has nothing on i dont like musicals but this and le mis are the only two exceptions from the energetic beginning to the emotional ending it holds your attention and keeps you engaged throughout everyone needs to see this at least once in your life it deserves your attention,happy
amazing movie must see ryan and emma are so cute and flawless3333 i love musicals and before this phantom was my favorite but after seeing this lala land is the best musical it is so beautiful the scenery and music and acting is just top notch please see it if you havent already,happy
a great movie about love music jazz chasing your dreams and sacrifices damien chazelles masterclass musical is one of the best musicals ever made and is the best musical in recent years damien chazelle continues his work on the theme of jazz which just goes to show how passionate he is about the genre of music great performances all around especially ryan gosling and emma stone as they have great chemistry and it makes you feel as though you are watching these two characters fall in love however not as good as chazelles first masterpiece whiplash in my opinion is still a great movie that shouldve won best picture the visuals of the scene and the frequent use of vibrant colours makes beautiful to watch and admire the musical numbers are fantastically placed in this movie as they arent just shoved in whenever they make you feel as though in that situation you would break out in a smooth song and dance number which is what it should make you feel all in all is one of the best movies of 2016 and i highly recommend you watch it even if you arent a fan of musicals 810,happy
one of the most uplifting movies ever made and inherently actual is a joy to watch seamlessly cruising through the choices the main characters have to make in order to become successful though their paramount achievement is becoming better persons and the way to do that is simple selfless love,happy
in the years of the great depression the average american went to damnable lengths just to pay bills or scare up food for their family and yet hollywood was still able to pull off successful numbers at the box office the reason escapism the late 1930s brought movies of pure joy and carefree lifestyles films like my man godfrey top hat chaplin and marx brother comedies were a tonic to forget hardship is a film in this vein 2016 is coming to a close and has yet to pump its breaks as a freighttrain of ugliness will have one of two effects on viewers the desired effect of escapism or one of jaded cynicism it was a telling experience that i fell firmly into the second categoryi will begin with how this movie succeeds and it does so spectacularly is a beautiful engaging and technical feat of production long choreographed takes and sparkling settings compliment music and dance that act as an ode to hollywood classics that could sweep you away the opening song and dance number sets the mood for how dutiful the production will be for the rest of the film hundreds of dancers jump and glide over car hoods on the interstate in perfect step in a single take the shot pulls back and the line of cars and dancers go on for miles here we meet our stars ryan gosling and emma stone are sebastian and mia classic dreamers mia is a parttime barista and even more parttime actress sebastian is a talented pianist that is willing to spin his wheels to the grave rather than sacrifice his integrity as an artist they have a modern meetcute a middle finger on the interstate like any classic musical their relationship develops through a series of musical numbers rather than dialogue they start as flirty enemies who dance at one another when the romance picks up they dance with one another we follow their romance as they court us through this new hollywood that isnt so unlike the old sebastian lives and breathes jazz perfecting pieces off of garbled records that were pressed before he was born mia auditions for any tired clich that will have her all while going to sleep with a 9foot ingrid bergman banner on her wall certainly follows a formula but it does so while celebrating it now for the cynics when you have a year like 2016 cute cat videos and puff stories on the news just cant quell the acidity of whats going wrong takes place in a world void of these struggles consequently its hard to see these beautiful people and think of their struggles as anything but trivial i found my smile frequently turning to an eyeroll when prompted to care about the conflict based on the overwhelming praise coming from countless other sources i count myself as unfortunate for falling victim to this dissonanceif there is anything imperfect about the musical arc of the film its that it plays more like a score than soundtrack the songs are as grandiose as any great broadway number but not as memorability they may not be meant to be but the songs dont exactly stay with you this is a true romance featuring actors with perfect chemistry you root for them to a point but when things get hard their worst case scenario is still a dreamy existence in,happy
is a piece of art i am not merely saying because of the bright musical that it is or the great acting by the leads but deep down underline somewhere it shows the conflict between love and dreams and though the movie is dreamy enough a 33 year old damien chazelle never forgets to showcase us that it is not practical to be only in love and be together we got to make choices between dreams and love to make the memories more beautifulmia and sebastian could never meet yet they met through their dreams they couldnt be together yet they always lived in their memories love for them was in fulfillment of each others dreams and if sebastian would not have called mia for that casting or if mia could not have confronted sebastian about his compromise of music over jazz they would have been mediocrethan there is emma stone who easily steals the show with her eyes and expressionsthis was acting for the ages and ryan gosling beautifully underplays himself making her more relevant to the plot  giving her context yet making his presence felt in a subtle mannerthe music was refreshing and the jazz was infectious most importantly i like the way director plays with the camera and the mood of the movie he makes mia as gorgeous as she can be by vibrant deep earthy colors he makes sebastian a sad soul without making him speak much and he had the most innovative sets you can see in a long long timeso yes is a piece of art i wish damien chazelle does a musical with leo someday would be refreshing to see,happy
this is a film that i will save up for viewing on those days or nights when i need to some color in my life or some sweetness but i dont want to search for those things i just want them to be delivered to me right up there on the screen or on my computer or dvd player first viewing i did not particularly like watching people dance  eh ive seen better my attention wanders im checking email im thinking that emma stone is no great beauty im wondering how it is that these two stone and gosling are going to carry this movie they do  they make this movie work emma stone looks like  and becomes  a plucky film star wannabe ryan gosling looks like  and becomes  a musician he learned to perform the jazz pieces no need for faking it without amazingly starting out an accomplished pianist i dont think i appreciated how much promise there was for their powerful romance until they exchanged a certain glance this is a very very lush umbrellas of cherbourg type film in my opinion can los angeles look any more beautiful does not match the romantic dramas of the 30s and 40s emma stone does not have the inner tenderness that peeks through the cool exterior of a bette or a joan she does convey something fresher though of a youthful actress today,happy
i have some difficulties to understand some very negative comments here about this movie i cant understand that one cant be touched by the sensibility of that romantic love story with an obvious chemistry between the two main actors and their subtle way of acting herevisually damien chazelle is often very creative and some scenes are pure poetry i really loved itas a musical i can confess that its probably not the best musical i saw in itself as singers and dancers ryan gosling and emma stone are not at the same level as big stars of classic musicalsbut no matter  its a marvelous tribute to that kind of movie and to hollywood golden age as well,happy
is one of a kind a true gem i so wish we would be able to see more in theaters it deserves the buzz and success it got and surely should have been awarded the best picture award at the last oscar ceremony they had it for a time until they finally gave it to a movie everyone barely knows but thats ok as long as we the general public give the full success it deserves and we doso where should i start there are so many assets in this movie i dont think 1000 words would be enoughfirst the story is so well written its full of hope love but most importantly lightness this movie is so carefree and poetic were getting in another universe that scene for example at the la observatory where emma stone and ryan gosling are dancing among the stars gave me chills i felt transported it was amazing and i remembered me and my companion holding each other hands tight as it was so powerful is such a great tribute to the legacy of hollywood and the musical genre in generalemma stone is mia a young small town girl who wishes to make a name in hollywood like many other girls but is not achieving real success until she meets sebastian a carefree pianist who lives through jazz and wish to open his own jazz club to give the genre a second youth recognizing each others talents they fall in love and take together the path to stardom both actors are truly awesome in their part and they display such a great chemistry throughout the movienow im not a true fan of jazz but i love the spirit and the songs are matching perfectly the lightness displayed throughout the movie city of stars is my favorite so far i love the dance scenes too including the very first one which get us straight to business id so wish waiting in the la traffic would be that fun that other one when stone and gosling are dancing on hilltop is making such a great tribute to the classic and no doubt it will become a classic soon tooyes damian chazelle should be proud of his baby because we dont make that kind of movie anymore and it has nothing to envy from the classic oldies of the 1950s and 1960s a,happy
 major spoilers ahead so yes this movie is definitely worth the high rating it will surely touch everyonemany elements and motives are included hollywood life atmosphere dreams against reality depth against superficiality and love so strong for the ultimate sacrifice of not being together reminds me of man on fire 2004  denzel washingtonacting is superb especially by emma stone the high quality of visual effects audio effects and directing are evident on every framenevertheless some elements and symbols are difficult to follow on a 2 hour period the musical parts that includes wording are too complex to understand unless watched more then once reminds me of pattersonalso for those who are not so much into music or acting the musical parts may be boring in addition the intellectual difference between the story heroes mia and sebastian and the rest of the world is too much emphasized on plenty occasions one might think that the heroes are both phds or somethingworth watching of course but not like the competitor moonlight which eventually took the oscar,happy
when you see the hype of any oscar nominated movie you wonder what it is about is is worth it  i was never fond of watching musicals or any kind of romantic films but this one is just out of this worldif you think you wont like this movie you are god damn wrongwith the charming and brilliant acting of emma stone and ryan gosling this piece of cinema gets you enthralled into a incredibly charismatic and musical experiencechazelle brought a lot of colours into this movie the elements of joy nostalgicaffectionconfusion were astonishingly woven together with stunning songs to create such a masterpieceits about dreams that may look maddening in the beginning phases of failure or defeat but with the continuous perseverance and sacrifice nothing is impossible it beautifully captures the bond between the two character mia and sebastian and how they support each other and love each other even when things were going haywirein the end it reveals the bitter truth of life that how one cannot have everything you desire in life there is always some pain for some amount of gain,happy
is just incredible how a 32 years old director can bring altogether cinema from the 40s 50s and 60s to create something fresh and unique from the opening shot you can already identify a thing that looks like a try of copying something old but that actually you wanna keep watching it this are some of the things i love in this movieemma stone how many actress can play the role of an actress emma performance was marvelous to me she was meant for this character end of discussionryan gosling i gotta say first that i love ryan no homo but i didnt know what to except from him in a movie like this since i was more used to his mysterious notso talkative characters but man it fitted just perfectly not the ryan from the notebook the ryan from and it was right on pointcolor damien used to the maximum the good things from our century and one of them was the way he worked the colors vivid fresh and meaningful the whole filmsoundtrack its funny because although this is a musical it doesnt restrict itself with the expected wholescenario singing and dancing through the whole movie the fact that one of the main characters is a jazz playerlover makes up that half of the movie soundtrack is jazz and it ends up working pretty wellcinematography you will be having flashbacks all the movie it recreates a hell lot of old types of shots and framing but it still feels fresh because its done with modern fashion its splendid to watch your eyes doesnt want to leave the screenoverall what i think makes this movie so great is that it brings dead cinema to life making the best usage of modern cinema techniques and equipment and without any flaws theres some much you can breakdown in this film and so little bad to point out in my opinion in think we could define this movie as neomusical,happy
i could talk about this film all day i saw it 3 times in the movie theatre and i can not wait to buy it when it comes out on dvdbluray i connected with the characters and the story so much i took one of my best friends to go see it and he even said he teared up a bit and connected with it just as much as i did we both saw ourselves in the characters this movie is not a love story i like to think of it as a passion story sebastian and mia love each other of course but it is so much more than that they have a real passion for each other they have a passion for what they want to do and they have passion for what the other one wants to do as well they push each other and support each other sebastian truly believes in mia and her talent and mia feels the same for him that is why she is so confused when he has the money to start his club but continues to play music that he doesnt particularly like just because it makes him good money he took that gig for her but in the end she just wanted him to be happy pursuing his real dream the jazz club they had something even deeper than love from experience i have been in love but i have also felt and still feel something even more than love for someone its a feeling that is so strong that there are literally no words for it that is what i feel sebastian and mia had in the end mia is married with a daughter she is happy and even in love but when she sees sebastian again that deeper feeling returns they are happy for each other because they each made their dreams come true they broke up not selfishly for themselves but for the other they sacrificed their relationship so the other one could succeed and focus on what they needed to do i could go on and on and i would love to but the overall theme that i feel this movie has is passion life may seem like a dream sometimes but there is a harsh reality to it as well sacrifices need to be made but passion is what will keep you strong and moving forward this film is great for anyone it talks about love dreams fighting for your dreams struggle strength and passion the cinematography the acting the directing all of it is just incredible to me even the title is perfect for so many reasons,happy
is a musical set in and mostly about hollywood and those who try to find their way in it it starts out with a big musical number on the highway and promises much it is also there we meet our two main characters mia and sebastian mia a struggling and aspiring actress and sebastian an equally struggling jazz pianist they keep running into each other and this musical evolves into a romanceunfortunately even if it brings along a lot of music it leaves the musical pretty much behind much of the ensemble and dance scenes as the introduction sets the tone for fail to materialize it is a good but rather classic romance about how two people meet in this case meet and meet again and ultimately fall for each other predictably trouble then ensues music and a songs are a central theme in this but this is not as much a musical as i hopedi like stones and goslings performances and i like the characters i like the storytelling in the movie it has some nice tricks with time and what ifs but i feel i dont really get what i expectedand in the end was it a happy ending710,happy
the story all begins with an enchanting amber blur of cars and voices on a highway stopped by traffic the voices cease and the oncestrangers transition into the opening musical number another day of sunan upbeat tune accented by its catchy lyrics about being a struggling hollywood actor in los angeles a bubbly girl in a bright yellow dress carols when they let you down morning rolls around and its another day of sun a metaphor for the resilience needed to make a living as an actor is a vintage fairytale about an aspiring actor and an aspiring jazz musician with a common desire to pursue what they love since this film was a romantic musical i was expecting a happy fairytale ending with them falling in love immediately however the song a lovely night dispelled those predictions when sebastian and mia lament about how theres no romance between them at all and how its such a waste of a lovely night later mia sings in an audition about how a bit of madness is key to give us new colors to see perhaps a hint on how she lost her stability in sebastian and the colors he showed her there is a common theme throughout the film when the seasons change from fall to winter to spring and summer the changing of the seasons represents mia and sebastians love changing and growing and eventually ending in the winter overall the film was a captivating movie musical however some songs and the story line were more evocative of old movie musicals and the movie would have been more gripping,happy
regardless of what you feel over the oscars mishap i will say outright that i do like this film a lot the scope of it visually as well as harmonically is immense this is especially apparent in both the opening another day of sun musical sequence that is 5 minute of uncut intensely intricate dancing and then on the museum date which is almost dreamy with how the visuals and the sound design mergesin terms of plot this film does have some similarities with damien chazelles last film the musicalthemed psychological thriller whiplash in that you have a jazz musician who is hellbent on making it in the world and by the end both him and his love interest do make it more on this later ryan gosling in this film acts way better than he sings that i can say for certain as a lot of times he is out of key and his voice doesnt suit a lot of the songs he does but his acting is great the scene where he begs for his job back is both serious and keeps the lightheartedness that the film does try and maintain emma stone in her oscarwinning role here is by far the better singer and dancer of the two and her performance as mia is very expressive and eager and also fun john legend has a good supporting role too as a former friend of sebastian gosling who he recruits into his pop band much to sebs reluctancethe soundtrack and the set designs are big and broad and totally awesome aside from gosling a lot of the vocals are strong and i was a bit disappointed in the lack of jk simmons as sebs old boss  i mean he was amazing in whiplash and is also a professional vocalist use it the ending is where the film does kind of fall down flat much like the grand budapest hotel which is amazing this film contains an ending that gets way too emotional way too fast we see seb and mia talk then a caption 5 years later comes on screen and we see mia is married with a young daughter to an older man and they visit a jazz bar in the evening owned by seb they lock eyes and imagine how if everything had gone completely their way what wouldve happened its a great musical number that ends very dourly on mia and her husband leaving with mia and seb exchanging one last look its just such a big leap with so much different in 5 years that you have no time to process it and it spits in the face of a lot of the film and it is a shame because narratively the film was good up to that pointnevertheless it is still an extremely enjoyable movie with good songs and direction that will make you want to keep watching it on repeat viewings the ending just keeps it from being perfect though,happy
i wanted to love this movie but i only liked it i am a theatre guy love great musicals appreciate the theater geek appeal of the plot in this film but i couldnt help wonder why couldnt they say see you in a few months if they loved each other all that aching much and while i enjoyed the music they are not singers really most of it was forgotten before i got into the car not one song stuck with me i liked the leads acting hollywood needed some positive pr and this colorful postcard shows you just what they want you to see of la,happy
to all those who have fallen in love or wish to fall this is a true masterpiece you will not look your watch once for about 2hours of screen time best performance fro emma stone and ryan gosling they have pulled up the characters miraculously what a love story  what an art moolah,happy
i was in the movie theatre today with my sister and we waited for that the movie will start finally we get to the cinema hall and we ate some popcorns anyway the movie finally started after commercials and the first scene was pretty good after the first music scene the real movie started we watched the movie while eating popcorns but the movie was the important thing in that hall after a while there was a scene from rebel without a cause 1955 i have seen the movie of course but the most important thing in the movie was the respect to old classic movies especially rebel without a cause and of course casablanca 1942 there were also a scene where the man and the woman went to the observation and danced through the stars that scene was so good that i get chills from it the love story between that man and woman was romantic description about what can you exprerience in the jazz bars emma stone deserve the oscar from her acting performance and was singing very beautifully about her grandmother the movie was really good and one of the best movies ive seen in my entire year im really thankful to the cast and of course the director thank you from me to all movie makers,happy
if only more movies would be like this the world would be a much better place to live from my point of view  it is amazing to see how emma and ryan show how multitalented theyre really are in this gorgeous movies oneofakindtruly inspiring time capsule that takes you back to the good old days of hollywoodi only hope that will set a trend in motion for producers and writers to put more creative energy in a script more emotion and involvement of the audience compared to the cutanddry modern movies that are out there  in my experience a new standard has been realized by the people that created and im very happy that their efforts have been awarded at the golden globes and the oscars,happy

im writing this review while im listening to the films soundtracki really dont know how to start this because ive heard a lot of things about this moviemostly negative commentsi loved the filmthough i like slow filmsmostly dramas like kieslowski and wendersit was so amusingso magicalit had the innocence and glare of a different timechazelles attempt was bold but he managed to capture us with his imagescostumes and musicits a film that i could watch again and againits a factmade history,happy
i was sceptical going into this film however damien chazelles earned a historic 14 oscar nominations as well as winning all seven golden globes that it was nominated for the film opens with an array of crayolalike colours in a busy los angeles traffic jam and already the cinematography is breathtaking this opening sequence is a perfect example of what hollywood can do on the big screen without the visual aid of superheroes big car crashes and all the other cgi nonsense used to break box offices these days the picture is a throwback to mgm musicals with a modern twist  after all it has been nominated for best picture at the oscars it is the perfect mixture of cheesy musical and a us take on french new wave if you could even imagine of such a thing  but it works excellently chazelle has become the master of making retro feel new weve been here before with hollywood trying to resurrect the bygone genre of musicals on the big screen many failures have been and gone scorseses new york new york in 1981 didnt quite reach the heights of the manhattan skyline that it was set in with viewers whilst woody allens 1996 everyone says i love you didnt really take off described as a allens frightened worldview is finally given full exposure and it is a grisly thing to behold by film critic jonathan rosenbaumthe film follows the tough relationship between seb a struggling musician who finds hope in all things jazz and mia an aspiring actress looking to get her career kick started what i liked about was how real it was  it wasnt ruined with cgi effects unrealistic plot lines or an array of visual steroids yes i know  it is a musical but chazelle has done a great job at making it feel oh so real a close up of a cracked iphone screen not exactly the textbook example of product placement but something we can all especially myself can relate to at one point or another even the way in which seb and mia first meet  this is not your typical love story seb is playing the piano in a sophisticated restaurant in la only to go against his bosses demands as he plays some of the finest jazz ive ever heard as mia goes to congratulate seb he simply barges right through her as if she was not thereas much as i can sit here and praise damien chazelle for days on end a lot of the films charm lies with the two leads ryan gosling and emma stone possess the chemistry and charisma that can really make a film is the pairs third film together and they simply just work whilst sharing the screen the two are not the greatest singers or dancers to have graced the screen but they have so much fun in doing so  which makes it all the more fun to watch stone has never been better she fits the role down to a t so hats off to the casting even if she was the second choice for the role behind emma watson the film is about personal drive as opposed to a love story  professional success is the aim and if you need to break a few hearts in the process then so be it nonetheless this film is made with charm and although were only in january im not confident a film will beat for the remainder of the year,happy
to get it out of the way this is the first musical i ever saw in my lifei absolutely loved itthe story was really well made and also well acted the music oh my god the music is greatsome tracks are lively some of them are really haunting emmas stone performance was amazing and added some depth to the movieryan gosling also did a great job with his role in this movie the set piece is great and reminds me of hollywoods gold era even though the movie takes place in present daythe story consists of two lovers who dream about the futurethey sing they dance and simply amaze me this movie is beautifulwhile watching it i simply forgot about everything  i probably loved this movie because i am a fool who dreamsafter watching it i couldnt stop thinking about it the main theme was still haunting meit truly inspired me and i think it is one of the best movies of the year an extraordinary masterpiece i am still dreaming really,happy
i dont like musicals at all but i loved the reason for this is simple its unlike any movie ive ever seen i have a huge appreciation for the way films are made so when i watch one as innovative as this its really specialthe plot of isnt really what the hype is all about two twenty somethings fall in love while trying to achieve their dreams in la thats pretty much it the plot moves slowly at times because a lot of the film relies on visuals not dialogue i think this is the main reason people dont understand the hype surrounding and i totally get thathowever if you know anything about the way movies are made you understand exactly what the hype is about the cinematography is so unique ive never seen light implemented quite like this before in all my years of watching movies the chemistry between emma stone and ryan gosling is palpable and even though they arent professional singers by any means there is so much heart in their singing that it doesnt matter the score is superb the costume design is effortless and brilliant the musical talent of gosling on the piano is wonderful is reminiscent of old hollywood in a way that will make you feel nostalgic for a time and place youve never even been toso if you dont like thats totally fine but i recommend you watch it a second time with a more careful eye the hype surrounding this film isnt about what you see at first glance but about all the little details that bring it together a movie like this doesnt come around very often  thats why its overrated,happy
as i take my earphones out and return to reality i am left with the feeling of joy that i have not felt in a long time this movie has not only blown me away but in fact given me a reason to love movies even more this film is hands down one of the best works of art i have seen in a long time mister damien chazelle you directed this with class and respect and it shows with every shot ever line and every scene i was blessed to lay my eyes on mister linus sandgren your work as cinematographer is jaw dropping to say the least i should know i spent half the time with my mouth wide open the other 40 was spent shaking my head in disbelief and the last 10 had me with my head on the table trying to figure out how i will ever be able to even come close to the techniques you used in this film lastly the talent that graced the screen from mr gosling and ms stone was second to none i dont know how to adequately put my feelings for the appreciation that i have for this film other than the words thank you you guys have proved that there is still hope for great talent and film that isnt complete and utter filth this film is something that i would be proud to have made and would stand behind 100 even though i dont like the one time ryan said f them but even still i believe this film should have won best picture and i hope that in the years to come this movie is remembered as the beginning of the rebirth of hollywood god bless and i look forward to seeing more incredible works from this team and god willing being able to work with you in the near future darrick,happy
when people think of movie musicals they associate the genre with older people or musical theater lovers to many kids and young teenagers movie musicals are boring and do not compare with the modern high action thrillers or clich romantic comedies on the other hand some hardcore musical fanatics may criticize movie musicals because they are no match to the original broadway musicals performed live in the flesh however lala land directed and written by damien chazelle is an original not based off of any existing musical performed live on a stage therefore the movie can not be compared to any other version with high appraise from movie critics nominations for several awards and attention from many music lovers there is no surprise that majority expect the film to be adapted from the big screen to the stage however some people believe that this credit is not all that deserving and the film is rather over exaggerated although seen by many as overrated damien chazelles lala land relates the audience to the hardships of love careers dreams and friendships through award winning music and brilliant acting making the movie musical one of the most deserving films of appraiseone of the aspects that makes this film great is its ability to relate to a wide audience of all ages who have experienced the ups and downs that life has to offer chazelle creates a story and characters that are just like us who have dreams and aspirations to achieve sebastian a passionate jazz musician and mia a struggling actress hoping to make a break in the hollywood industry both chase their own dreams while struggling to tie in a relationship normally in a clich typical hollywood ending the guy would get the girl and each person will eventually fulfill their bucket list of dreams however this movie musical gives the hard truth of reality that life does not always work out the hollywood way the story line is tragic yet phenomenal and both characters in the movie learn that even in los angeles the heart and center of hollywood their happy ending would take sacrifices of love and dreams choices have to be made all the time in life and like sebastian and mia sometimes we just have to decide which roads to take where these roads take us is unknown but we have to be willing to take a chance on our dreams this movie is all about taking chances and the great possibilities that come from risks and sacrificespeople who love music know how something as simple as a song or tune can transform the entire experience of watching a movie when the music is put together with a visual image in lala land the movie would be nothing without the music considering it is in fact a musical however it is not that often people come across a movie musical soundtrack where each song is catchy original and meaningful with its lyrics justin hurwitz the music composer for the film captures the mood of every scene with a song whether the scene was an upbeat dance a slow waltz an argument a magical fantasy or a walk in the park at night there was a perfect song for it jazz also plays a major part in the music as well as in the plot sebastian has a true passion for real pure jazz throughout the movie he thinks this style of music is dying and convinces mia as well as the audience of the importance and beauty of the traditional genre even if you do not find the rhythm of jazz entertaining hearing the soundtrack and sebastians take on the art form may just change your mind nevertheless regardless of your preference on jazz there is still something for everyone in the music soundtrack for lala land with ryan gosling playing sebastian as the lead male role and emma stone as mia for his scene partner brilliant acting is inevitable both are very successful actors with already big names in the hollywood industry many know ryan gosling for his lead role in the notebook while emma stone has captured many lead roles in several popular movies such as the amazing spiderman and the help they also have evident on scene chemistry because they previously acted together in the movie crazy stupid love in 2011 furthermore these actors are both nominated for the golden globes under the best actor and actress category they had to sing dance and act as well as learn how to play the piano which is not all easy tasks to perform nevertheless they pulled it off and created the characters of mia and sebastian that the audience will love and connect to on an emotional level before turning away from lala land because movie musicals are not your preferred genre i encourage you to give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed through moving music and excellent acting this movie tells a compelling story of real life that is sure to appeal to all audiences with numerous awards and nominations as well as positive critiques i doubt you will find lala land to be overrated but rather worthy of all its praise,happy
from watching the trailer it gives off a very enthusiastic and fun mood however that may be slightly deceiving as the movie goes through a range of emotions some will be unexpected and that is what makes this film so great a must watch till the end even though the beginning half may be a bit slow it is worth it if they had cut out some details or made the beginning half a little shorter then it would have been perfect the musical numbers are plenty and all very well executed i absolutely love the soundtrack here is a movie based entirely around the musical element and it is phenomenal as i write this now im listening to the soundtrack as all or most i presume of the songs are original they are able to create the song to suit each character not only that but choreography throughout is simply amazing those like the beginning scene is simply to initiate the audience as to what they are getting into others like the tap dancing scene with gosling and stone are infused with feeling and flirtation the cast is perfect gosling and stone complement each other so well  they were previously paired in crazy stupid love gosling is such a versatile actor just looking at his imdb history is so impressive he can encompass a range of personas and is great at portraying characters with a lot of passion stone is also quite a versatile actress and it is hard not to like her i heard from my friend that there area also quite a lot of distinguished dancers in the movie and that doesnt surprise me it is a musical after all and that requires great dancers not just great actors and actresses so overall everyone did their parts extremely well and was able to bring a lot of energy to the story what makes this such a classic is that it pays homage to many eras in the hollywood film industry there is a bit of film noir quite a few scenes depicting the silent era there is of course the sound era and the introduction of technicolor and what makes it so classical is the fact that it mimics the style of singin in the rain what with the musical numbers and also the selfreflective aspect of the story while in singin the characters were actually making a movie in they show some behind the scenes of how hollywood is like there is also quite a few instances where characters break the fourth wall and this is done so smoothly that it doesnt really affect the diegesis the ending scene as well is very much like the one in singin though produces a different effect overall this film is definitely a new classic and i thoroughly enjoyed it everyone i knew was saying how good it was and i cant agree more,happy
anyone who finds the chemistry between stone and gosling wonderful will be divorced in a few years seriously a better male figure would have made this a classic stone is wonderful the music is good the story is pretty good still the story needs a more accessible male figure and that is not overcome by the rest of the story,happy
this is up for 14 nominations and is bound to walk away with the lions share of oscars it was a pleasant movie but did not reach the level of greatness for me that it has for others here it is a basic girlmeets boy movie with a bittersweet ending there is not a song from the movie that i came out humming or singing if emma stone wins for best actress in this movie it would only show me how weak this the category may be this year but i havent seen arrival or elle so i dont know about these movies as i watched this movie i did think about les parapluies de cherbourg 1964 but that movie was a modern opera and 2016 comes no where near that great michel legrand work of yesteryear,happy
from time to time we feel the need of watching a movie without too many special effects explosions people punching kicking shooting and killing people this is the one and it has no sex on the bed either jazz pop music but mainly jazz and even old style tap dancing everything mixed up with a tender love story half real half dreamed between a jazz pianist and a girl who is trying to start a life as an actress a technically excellent movie in terms of cut and image sequences some of them very beautiful for instance the opening sequence of a collective dance on a road filled with cars during a traffic jam is wonderful indeed a movie to be loved almost a masterpiece,happy
i dont understand why this film doesnt have a 10this film is so good that makes us cry when it ends just because its doneit opens with one of the most fantastic sequenceplan of all history and it ends just like it has to be to broke our hearteverything is in the right plane from direction to acting from soundtrack to photographyi have to wright 10 lines about the movie but i just have one line to describe itthis is the perfect movie,happy
quintessencial 710 not to be confused with 77 please maybe youll be surprised but i think the best part of the movie is its ending which has the very meaning of the film sebastian realized his dream by creating his own jazz club not continued a career in the band whereas mia on the contrary became an actress in poppy movies not in solo plays as she wanted separately i would like to mention the performances by ryan gosling and emma stone  great chemistry between them also good music songs dances visuals nevertheless we have probably a cute pastiche no more no less and only downers may not like this movie at all but this is a second the artist not singin in the rain will hardly revive the fashion and love for musicals like the artist has not done so with silent movies yes a nice movie indeed but sorry hardcore damien chazelles fans for him personally especially after whiplash its rather a step down to more mainstream movies and entertainment he wants to please everyone and this is his vulnerable feature incidentally interesting how it rhymes with the films ending the director is on the sebastians side but he himself is mia ,happy
since the overwhelming consensus is that this is the best thing since sliced bread my opinion probably means very little here still ill try to sum up my feeling of the film5 seconds in i had tears in my eyesthe first musical number is absolutely incredible its big its wild its colourful and filled with power and joy the last scene in the movie is absolutely amazing as well i wont spoil anything but it somehow captures both the extreme highs and the lows of emotion in only a few minutesits the bits in the middle that bother mesee a lot of it just drawn out at some point it just becomes an infinite loop of the two lead actors staring wistfully into the distance to jazz music there are a few of those big showstopper numbers in between but they jar with the long quiet blandness of the rest of the film these two parts of the film are never reconciled theres something off about the flow of the whole thing the way it all connects the cinematography and colours are beautiful even in the normal scenes but all of the big emotional creativity  the actual core of the movie  seems to have been reserved for the songs now this wouldnt be a problem if there was a song for each important beat but there are only about 5 songs that are actually sung by the characters considering most broadway musicals have about 15 songs this movie exists in a weird state where the creators arent sure as to whether they want a colourful largerthanlife broadway musical or a realistic toneddown nonmusical drama which is a shame really because the scenes on their own are crafted masterfully its just that they fall apart as a wholethe cinematography and directing is a delight the actors are lovely if limited by the script as said they spend a lot of time staring wistfully into the distance and the music is wonderful so i dunno go watch it if you have the time  youll probably like it more than i did,happy
these two are just super cute together although to be honest i buy them more as best friends or brother  sister i didnt think it was a walltowall songanddance musical like i expected it was more like a regular movie and more drama than i expected with a few neat musical numbers their first dance together when they didnt really like each other that much was terrific i loved seeing jk simmons in it which reminded me of the excellent whiplash that damien chazelle made before this and im really proud of chazelle for getting this done  now he can live his dream and make exactly what he wants this love letter to hollywood is his story too i wasnt crazy about the surprise twists at the end but its definitely the most charming picture of the year something the whole family will enjoy like the artist its a unique experience that deserves all the praise its gotten,happy
is one of the most different and entertaining movies of recent times i have ever seen the acting and the melodious musical numbers mesmerized me the colorful setting and dresses also add to the cinematic flair the story is about two aspiring people with dreams of what they want to become sebastian ryan gosling and mia emma stone sebastian is an exceptional jazz pianist who wants to revive jazz with his own jazz club which he dreams to make and mia dreams to be an exceptional actress the two meet under random circumstances somewhat rudely drawn together by their aspiration to do what they love they fall for each other however their dreams conflict with their love for each other ryan gosling excellently expresses his love for jazz and mia he enacts the piano playing part exceptionally well and it really looks like he is a gifted jazz pianist emma stone is a show stealer as mia with her expressive eyes aspirations and acting skills especially during the scenes where her character auditions and her chemistry with ryan gosling is amazing john legend as keith utilizes his short onscreen time well portraying a man with a different taste in jazz which sebastian doesnt like and he happens to be a good friend in needdamien chazelles direction keeps the movie flowing from one beautiful musical number to the next mandy moores exceptional choreography charms us particularly in a lovely night which was done in oneshot on a hilltop on sunset and includes amazing dancing from the main actors my favorite scene is the scene in the planetarium with creative visuals such as sebastian and mia flying in the sky dancing sebastian and mias dresses in the movie are spectacular and some of the best i have seen in a movie the film is also shot in cinemascope which gives it the vibe of many golden hollywood musicalsthe movie has a positive message about mia and sebastian never giving up their dreams despite multiple failures mia still pursues her dreams about being an actress and the same with sebastian about starting a jazz club i give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 the only inappropriate thing about the movie is some of the language but that is infrequent this is a movie which everyone will enjoy this film opens in theaters on december 25 2016 so go and check it out for a unique musical unlike any otherreviewed by arjun n kids first film critic for more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org,happy
this review has spoilers this will be a short review of to be blunt is basically 500 days of summer which came out in 2009 with more song and dance numbers i read one review about along with hearing all the buzz about how great of a film it is so i saw a late showing of it on new years eve i was the first in the theater and i thought that i would be the only one but about ten random people walked in i thought that the retro intro of the film such as the cinemascope graphic was cool but as the film started i felt like why does this movie seem so familiar then it hit me 500 days of summer i then was able to predict what was going to happen in the filmhere are some of the similarities of both filmsboth films have the theme of boy meets girl boy gets girl boy loses girlboth films have the change in seasonshas angels flight and 500 days of summer has angels knollin 500 days of summer tom and summer see an older film in the same thing happens500 days of summer has expectations vs reality and has a dream sequence scene at sebastians jazz club sebs where the characters imagine what their lives would have been like if they had stayed togetherbut 500 days of summer wasnt the only film that will remind you of as i watched some of the other scenes i kept thinking why does that look so familiar the film is basically an homage to musicals such as singin in the rain and an american in paris the scene that is so obvious is towards the end with the boy and the giant red balloon which was a blatant homage to the red balloon which teachers at my elementary school seemed to have enjoyed screening for us i read a review after watching the film and it had still comparisons of dance numbers from the plethora of films it pays homage to including sleeping beauty one of the homages to 500 days of summer is when sebastian and mia are riding angels flight in downtown los angeles although tom joseph gordonlevitt and summer zooey deschanel didnt actually go on angels flight they sat on one of the benches next door at angels knoll how many homages can a current film have in it from films decades old along with a super similar story line to a more current film from 2009 before it stops being an homage and starts being something else like a best of compilation piecedo i think that is a good film yes do i think that it is a great film no do i think that it is an overrated film yes do i think that it will receive countless awards and nominations yes hollywood loves films with song and dance numbers especially if the actors arent known for those talents this would have been a much better film if joseph gordonlevitt had portrayed the character of sebastian instead of ryan gosling gordonlevitt can show more emotions on screen than one look gosling and has a better singing voice along with dancing talent500 days of summer was original and felt more real because of the characters and the nonclich happy ending and the real places in la that the average person could visit that arent normally scene in films that are made in la is definitely a fun date film and likable but when you realize as i did that this is a lesser version of 500 days of summer with more song and dance numbers along with a boatload of homages it doesnt seem as creative as the current hollywood buzzhype portrays it to be,happy

why do you go to the cinema for me it is to be moved to laugh to cry to be frightened to be in awe to be amused in a gentle way this movie did this to me in all 5 ways i am mr ordinary  i have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family i have wooed a certain number of women i have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family i have lost my parents i try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life this movie defines me if you miss it this time dont worry youll catch it later most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage my advice is to go and see it now its not perfect  its a bit english a bit middle class the story is preposterous but the sentiment the message hits the spot take one of your significant others take a first date take a box of tissues its the reason you go to the cinema,happy
from the director of love actually who is also the writer of four weddings and a funeral bean notting hill and the bridget jones films it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy romantic comedy drama film about time travel although it shares some similarities with the time travelers wife the same female lead actress rachel mcadams and groundhog day but rest assured about time is a witty intelligent charming sweet film with surprising depth and heart the script was well written the direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their respective roles the film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running timedespite the timetraveling plot device the story focuses on the fatherson relationship of tim and his dad and the lovely romantic relationship between tim and mary without being too sappy too overly loveydovey or too sentimental the message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachythe selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenesthe onscreen chemistry between rachel and domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together on the other hand domhnall and bill as father and son their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them togetherits one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer better than the disappointing time travelers wife its a great date movie thats not to be missed,happy
what an amazing movie when i see the cast and the title i immediately thought of a romantic clich with full of known plot twists and et cetera rachel mcadams is known for her romantic movies but this was just more and more than thatabout time was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen i was immediately captured and the cast is so brilliant i believed every single line thank you for this film i am still under the influence of this movie it is about life in the most raw way how life should be lived and how we should see the world as it isextraordinary movie magnificent,happy
initial impressions of a book film play piece of music etc can sometimes be illconsidered i have occasionally revised my opinion of such a work with the passage of time i am confident however that i shall not change my view on about time the sheer brilliance of which has quite bowled me over its not only one of the very best films i have seen recently its one of the best i have ever seen yes i think its that goodabout time is a romantic comedy about the vicissitudes of life and love its witty clever intelligent and very funny but its also a film of perhaps quite surprising depth the centrepiece of the film is the relationship between tim domnhall gleeson a young lawyer living in london and his father bill nighy who lives with tims mother lindsay duncan in cornwall tims father is able to time travel he cannot change history when doing so but he can revisit past experiences and incidents within his own life and alter their outcomes tim has inherited this ability from his father a gift which apparently is hereditary on the male side of the family he uses it to improve his love life he builds up a strong bond and a young family with mary rachel mcadams but he soon realises that his exceptional gift does not protect him from the normal ups and downs of family life indeed one of the most moving scenes in the film and there are many is a conversation tim has with his father on learning that the latter has terminal cancer the performances the screenplay the direction and the soundtrack are first class the humour is excellent there is one very funny scene in which tim nervously meets his prospective inlaws for the first time and blurts out an admission that he and mary do not practise oral sex there is also a very amusing sex scene the soundtrack includes music performed by the cure amy winehouse and nick cave indeed the featured cave song into my arms forms a motif for the themes depicted in the film and gets a specific mention by tims father when he is discussing his funeral arrangements with tim about time is a very watchable intelligent and witty film that could so easily have descended to mawkishness and sentimentality but it doesnt its a brilliant film that raises in the viewers mind all sorts of important questions about life love and loyalty do go and see it 1010,happy
i loved this film i perfect balance of story humour and sincerity along with excellent acting and a wonderful cast even the soundtrack was superb not your average time travel movie very thought provoking and one which tugged at the old tear ducts in the best way some reviews complain about how it is like this or that film no film is unique and for sure there are similarities with other richard curtis films but that is all plus to be compared to other great films is surely an honour forget about all that and enjoy what is a great film which will inspire you in ways you were not expecting thoroughly enjoyable and im already looking forward to going to see it again that doesnt happen very often,happy
i just dont understand how people are not liking this film it is just perfect any richard curtis movie i rate against love actually because to me that is his best film and one of my all time favourites but about time for me beats love actually hands down the film is so well thought out and the cast is just so good i have seen this movie twice already as it was such a great story the main focus of the film is about love and family so dont be too worried about the travelling in time it fits into the film so well and makes some great comic moments when things go wrong dont listen to the haters this really is a fabulous movie it is a sad thought though that this could be richards last film he is going to direct i hope not but if it is what a way to end his brilliant films well done richard curtis 1010,happy
my husband accompanied me but warned me that he would not stay if it didnt interest him after 15 minutes he stayed and gave me the summary chick flick for menits a fantasy because it deals with living in the present and the past at the same time its a romance because its about young love and love expressed between two people who have been married for a very long time and still feel that spark that brought them together its a family film about siblings loving one another so much that one of them might just jeopardize his future to save his sisters life its a cautionary tale for those who practice habits that could sicken them or get them killed its about life and truly living ones life even when faced with the prospect of death the acting is solid and rachel mcadams is lovely and inspiring the rest of the actors are amazing as well and you want to believe that it is all real but the story itself can be so unbelievable just go with it its like a really high calorie dessert that tastes so good you dont care if you gain five pounds i enjoyed about time immensely and i could watch it again and again,happy
i love horror movies i like fun movies but i am not really into romantic movies except this one i think it is well paced and has a lot of heart and warmth and i swore profoundly when i read the reviews in the danish media as i see it it is not just another boy meets girl love story it is first and foremost a story about appreciating life  even the everyday routine but also a film about the bond between a young man and his fathersuffice it to say this the plot is great and the story is well paced the casting and acting is very good by all the main characters bill nighy is really a joy to watch the musicsound track is spitzenklasse throughout i would not have to think twice if rachel mcadams were to ask me to have a third childsic the fatherson farewell scene brought me the rare sensation of tears in my eyes thank you for that,happy
a young man like many others only he can travel in time this main element of the plot is something that was difficult to digest throughout the film since it was not a predominantly scifi movie this struggle was compensated by the successful interjection that even with such ability life can have difficultiesthe main character did use this to his advantage to win the love of the girl he was so fond of but still he often faced difficult choices as to let things happen or turn the time back to prevent themone thing that makes this stand out is the somewhat philosophical approach an approach that is conveyed with simplicity so all can relateoverall it is an intelligent film with emotion and poignancy,happy
one of the best movies i have watched till date this movie makes you imagine all what you can feel and all what you want to feel in just 120 minutes worth watching millions of times i have seen many time travel concepts before but this is where my heart pounded better than any wherenot only romances is magnificent humor and drama are also far better than many classics with heart touching soundtracks and songs the movie has eye pleasing scenescharacters are perfectly casted performance screenplay dialogues etc all are first class but the best is the presentation of emotions which could be linked to every single person who ever loved someone or just believes inthe movie begins with casual entries and remains a good entertainer till second half while in the last quarterending it cross a bridge and steps in best movie category platform with a message of livingi strongly recommend this movie to all the viewersi rate this movie 1010,happy
really surprised by this onewas expecting the run of the mill romcom but it is so much more than that its about family and the smiles and cries of life the whole film was filled with charm wit and had its fair share of heartfelt moments time travel is a subject that has been visited many times in the film industry but this had its own unique touch to it the film flows really nicely it oozes class at some points and the mere thought of having the ability to travel back in time sends your mind into a whirlwind of whatifs the acting is superb by all but bill nighy was my favourite as tims dad when on screen with domhnall gleeson tim the connection is very convincing and it was those scenes that i enjoyed the mosta very good film and worthy of a viewing by any standards 72510,happy
i attended a preview screening of this in londonif you enjoy previous richard curtis writer director films such as four weddings and a funeral notting hill and love actually then you will very likely enjoy this sweet time travel comedy drama albeit with an ironic sense of time travel feeling of been having been here beforebut that more of the same feeling is no bad thing thanks largely to the wonderful performances of the cast and more importantly the exquisite execution of its new spin the time travelling plot device in fact the time travelling here is really good fun and plentiful as its employed with typical motives but with inventiveness by our main protagonist a stereotypical loser played with utter charm and goofiness by domhall gleeson his use of the power is at times hilarious but very useful without your typical changing your past will backfire moral message in most time travel movies changing events in the past is usually painted as a negative repercussion but here for the most part the movie is certainly promoting its benefits the time travel premise have some set rules that nicely serves the narrative although if you think too carefully in some scenes you might find some minute flaws in the execution of the cause and effects which could have been made neater if extra attention was paid there is a moral message but you have to wait until the end to get what it is because it isnt so obvious as the film rolls you might suspect things will happen in some ways as you watch the film but they dont and you might wonder whats the story then but let it roll and the point of it all comes at the end however that waiting for the end leads to my first little bit of criticism this film clocks in at just over 2hours and it did feel a tad too long there are quite a few points in the film which i feel could have been trimmed i think it could have been about at least 10 minutes shorterthere are familiar stalwart faces from richard curtiss previous films making guest appearances with the always awesome bill nighy justifiably anchoring a supporting role with his usual high calibre presence its also nice to see one of our great british character actors who had recently passed away make a surprise and funny bit part appearance perhaps for the last timeor did the film makers travel back in time to shoot his part rachel mcadams is very lovely as the love interest and is believable as a girl worth manipulating time for im not a great fan of richard curtis previous movies but this film swims along with so much charm english middle class idiosyncrasies a lovely romance and a gentle pacing that flows with a steady beat from beginning to end this is not a riotous comedy its not a thriller nor an adventure or even a film that draws any suspense towards the last act its a journey through a period of our time travellers life sometimes funny charming poignant with a very clever and enjoyable time travelling premise its certainly a great date movie too810,happy
every now and then a film comes along that changes the way i think about life about time is that kind of movie this pleasantly unique film isnt just a love story its a life story it showcases a variety of relationships that go beyond the traditional romcom stereotypes the story is uplifting the acting is excellent and the humor is plentiful this movie made me want to be a better person and im very glad i saw it,happy

the characters are very strong you just cant help but to fall in love with every each one of them theyre so unique but yet so familiar for me i feel like i know them and could relate to each one of the characterthe message is strongyes the message is common but yet the way they tell the story makes you appreciate life a whole lot more after watching this movie i came to realize that little things should not be taken for grantedi dont know about anyone else but if a movie can make me think about my own life then its definitely an awesome moviethe movie is funny charming witty touching and inspiring must watch but please keep the tissue box near,happy
im older now but this movie still gets me its a wonderful love story about boy meets girl but the real story is the love between dad and son superbly acted by all involved and with a stellar soundtrack you can watch it ten times and be touched by the story every time i cant recommend it enough for those days when real life is so negative,happy

over the years british writer richard curtis has scripted some wonderful romantic comedies four weddings and a funeral notting hill and love actually so by now we know the features of curtisworld locations in london upper middleclass english types lots of friendship and love plenty of wry and sometimes rude humour a socially inhibited boy an attractive north american girl a doddery elderly male relative a freaky young female relative probably a wedding probably a funeral obviously some heavy rain wellchosen songs and finally a clever film title about time which curtis has both written and directed delivers all the familiar ingredients and is a charming addition to the canon but while i really liked it it was not love actuallythis time we have two love stories and a time travel device that enables both to achieve special fulfilment there is the fatherson relationship between bill nighy and domhnall gleeson and the sexual relationship between glesson and canadian rachel mcadmas coincidentally the time travelers wife both the technique of time travel clenching hands in a darkened space and the rules forget the butterfly effect are rather ridiculous but the device serves to pose some almost philosophical questions if you could travel back in time to change things in your life how often would you do it and what would you change in the end is it a power that you would use to change the facts of the past or your perception of the present,happy
an ordinary 21 year old man is shocked to discover that he has the ability to travel through time a concept which granted is not new to the world of cinema although this unusual ability is naturally the main theme of the film the plot still engages the viewer with the struggles of every day life including marriage finding a job having children as well as a few family issues to keep the plot fresh the intriguing plot complements the few timetravelling excursions and keeps the idea crispthe plot is thought provoking and the script is kept light with several laughoutloud moments which can be alltoo rare in this genredomhnall gleeson gives an extremely high quality performance in his lead role and is supported well by the highly experienced romcom lead rachel mcadams and an everamusing bill nighy who provides much of the comic relief in the filmthe plot could perhaps be accused of moving slowly at times however this only serves to heighten the drama of the intriguing plot twists,happy
about time is one half snappy romance and another half family drama which lures us into the tutelage of some very beneficial chicken soup for the soul truisms like value your life and live everyday fully notice the beauty in the small things around you and be brave to say goodbye to the beloved and move on such and such and under the sine qua non of a timetravel setup at the age of 21 tim gleeson in his breakthrough leading man offer a clumsy young brit learns from his father nighy that all men in his family can travel in time with certain limitation for sure so with this windfall fatealtering gift tim starts to woo mary the girl of his dream and eventually they get married and babies are coming on the way on the face value the film is tremendously entertaining and heartwarming tims naturalistic maladroitness proffers enough ballast for repeating his onetrick pony to finally win mary over along the way there are laughters galore the family bond is also capaciously constructed between tim and his father and a detour to save his sister kit kat wilson from wrong choices in her life the biggest revelation of the timetravel theory comes after tim has fixed kit kats past by going back to the timeline before the conception of tim and marys first baby when he jumps back the process has altered the babys gender then immediately after that scene tim manages to miraculously change everything back to normal so clearly this no pre baby travel rule can be amended afterward which drastically conflicts with the eventual dilemma of choosing between going back to visit his deceased father and having a baby no 3 after his dads death for the reason that he can reverse the repercussion of the butterfly effects whatsoever as he did in the case of kit kat im not nitpicking as i am more than happier to overlook the technicality of timetravel experience take one example how come kit kat gets a hunch that she is in love with jay after they went back to the past and altered their fate while tim is oblivious of his newborn babys gender until he sees him with his own eyes but the film is deeply flawed in a logic standpoint and this plothole is too glaring to overlook which does hurt the movies empathy in its final stage alas the performances are generally favorable nighy surges into my supporting actor chart as a benevolent father figure immensely understanding and reasonable passes on his wisdom which accumulated through ages with coherent delivery and as the sole theory elucidator he is the one attracts the most amount of interest on screen although he should have warned his son about the rule beforehand which would save the film from its paradoxical miasmagleeson and mcadams makes a fitting couple although for the latter it is her third time being the girl of a timetraveler after eric bana and owen wilson her american sweetheart default and clever dressing choice remarkably masks the age difference while a babyface gleeson doesnt truly reflect the passing years in the narrative there are also several interesting secondary players the sexy bomb margot robbie appears as tims unrequited love interest lindsay duncan sheds a light of coolness as tims unwitting mother and tom hollander is the swearing playwright with a cynical bad temper about time is oscar nominated writer richard curtis third venture the man who writes mr bean series bridget jones series notting hill 1999 and four weddings and a funeral 1994 710 as a director after love actually 2003 710 and pirate radio 2009 no wonder it is such a successful crowdpleaser and even a tearjerker only if its content could have made more sense out of the infinite loop impedes the time travel subgenre,happy
i approached about time with very low expectations it hasnt arrived with the same fanfare or same star power as many of writerdirector richard curtis other blockbusters notting hill and love actually for example and the trailer implied something slightly twee rather than truly uplifting but sometime during the first fifteen minutes i berated myself severely and settled in to what started out as a very sweet tender and gently amusing filmthen it stuttered and the stuttering continued as we edged towards highs and stumbled into elongated lows where nothing much occurred and nobody seemed quite sure of how to lift it againon new years eve 21year old tim lake domhnall gleeson listens wideeyed as his dad bill nighy imparts some fantastic truth about the men in the lake family they can travel back in time there are rules of course but the fact remains tims world has opened up in a most remarkable way much to his fathers dismay tim decides the best use of his newfound ability is to finally secure a girlfriend in a longwinded and occasionally funny manner he courts mary rachel mcadams mary is insecure and likes to sleep a lot and other stuff happens too eventually and some of it even comes about as a result of time travel maybethe obvious and immediate comparison with about time is the time travellers wife which starred um rachel mcadams unfortunately though the latter was a weak adaptation of a beautiful book about time has the feel of what was left on the cutting room floor after theyd excised the humour and protracted subplotten years ago hugh grant would have been cast as tim and at times it feels as though gleeson has been forced into grants shoes its a pity because he is a fine actor and when allowed to be the tim in his own head does a wonderfully charming and understated job the screenplay sucks but thats hardly his fault theres also about the same level of chemistry between tim  mary as there was between the tomato and chard on my dinner plate last nightbut when gleeson and nighy share the screen about time sparkles the relationship between father and son is beautiful it is tender it is funny and it is the glue that binds the film i came away not wishing i had the boygirl relationship but dreaming that the fatherson bond was mine what a pity curtis didnt have the courage to turn this romcom on its head and make tim and mary secondary to tim  dadthere are moments of pure joy where curtis is on his very best form the wedding scene is the finest weve seen screen since james fleets best man speech in four weddings  a funeral it doesnt hang around it is neither schmaltzy nor patronizing but is magically sweet and funny the theatre sequence too is comedy gold in a completely different way the last few scenes with tim and dad are tender sensitive and deeply affectingand then curtis undoes the stitching take the dress scene weve seen it in countless films before where girl tries on dresses but cant make her mind up while boy fails to help the issue its no longer original and in this incarnation is at least five dresses too long its so protracted it hurts its a problem that persists throughout about time it just doesnt know when to stop frequently it even forgets what it is about and suddenly throws in a time traveling scene to justify its name inside this lumpy tedious 117 minute trudge is an 85 minute gem desperately fighting to escape was script editor emma freud asleep when she held her red pen was editor mark day afraid of offending curtis black marks to them boththe supporting cast is a real boon to about time lyndsay duncans mum is just the right side of eccentric while uncle d richard cordery is as mad as a box of frogs and delightfully so chief amongst them is harry tom hollander the selfcentered embittered playwright who takes any glimmer of joy crumbles it insults it and stamps on it for good measure he is used sparingly to crisp the edges of scenes that edge towards tedium what a pity he wasnt let loose with a flamethrower throughoutbut even with the minor characters and their subplots curtis struggles as if he has a checklist of occurrences he absolutely must insert to appeal to everyone and so he throws in a broken sister with alcohol and domestic issues parental issues with overbearing visiting folks about time is too much too long too overegged and too reliant on previous films watching about time is like swimming through porridge to the occasional pockets of beautifully sweet honey and then struggling onwards in vain the hope of anotherfor more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog and like the facebook page,happy
when richard curtis turns to scifi as a vehicle for his acclaimed human stories the results is mixed as scifi about time is an absolute disaster as curtiss signature thoughtful gentle and often humorous exploration of human feelings it is delightfulim not going to waste time on a discourse of time traveling one does not need to be an isaac asimov devotee to understand the most fundamental paradox what happens when you meet yourself in the past as well a key theme addressed in the proliferation of timetraveling movie is whether you can change things in the past so that you switch yourself into a difference life line suffices to say that curtis is not even remotely concerned with these questions but simply uses this loose idea of time traveling to suit whatever he wants to do in his movie bending it whichever way his whims or the need of the movie steers i cant even say there are logical plot holes because in this movie insofar as the science of time travel is concerned there is no logic none whatsoever periodas curtis has demonstrated times and again depth does not necessarily require gravity nothing to do with the recent movie with that title a vast majority of we mortals live a life that cannot be even remotely associated with the word epic with any stretch of imagination indeed we face life death partings illness joys and woes but none as dramatic as what you would see depicted on the silver screen what curtis does best is touching the everyday audience with everyday slices of life romance parental siblings love parenthood friendshipall quite ordinary and as such empathywinningtold by vo of the protagonist everything in this story revolves around the young man from the idyllic cornwall coast who articles in london to be a lawyer then becoming one domhnall gleeson intelligent but unassuming is instantly lovable as he projects his easy humor to both the people around him in the movie and the audience no matter how many times i see the first appearance in any movie of rachel mcadmas it always comes with a wow especially this one and you have to watch it to see why the romance as said is slicesoflife light but by no means lacking in depth bill nighy elicits another sort of wow and in this movie as the father he makes our protagonist the envy of every son tom hollander always lifts a movie a notch whether it is good or bad and this one is definitely good plot disaster notwithstanding playing a family friend and an eccentric playwright he is not unlike one of the caricature portraits in a dickens novel lydia wilson is a joy to watch as the protagonists sister with a telltale name of kit kat there are others too in a large support cast making solid contributionsat the end of the day after lots of laughs and many heartwarming moments the audience emerges with an endearing though treasure every day you life scifi forget it,happy
pleasant romantic comedy about a young man domhnall gleeson who is told by his father bill nighy on his 21st birthday that all the men in his family possess the ability to travel back in time he proceeds to use this new gift repeatedly to help him fix mistakes in his life and to help him with his relationship with a pretty girl rachel mcadams as a romantic comedy with some tearjerker moments its very enjoyable and nice as science fiction it will give you headaches with all the plot holes so the more unforgiving scifi fans out there might want to skip this one i didnt mind it much at first but it got more complicated as it went along the plot itself is reminiscent of groundhog day and maybe a little bit of somewhere in time gleeson and mcadams both do very well and have great chemistry mcadams is especially likable gleeson has an appealing young hugh grant quality about him bill nighy steals the show from everybody as is often the case its a good movie if you dont think too hard about it but i must stress if you are someone who is a stickler for flaws in plots or someone who nitpicks time travel stories you will really hate this everybody who doesnt fit that description should definitely check it out,happy
i went into this movie expecting a cute romance with a touch of comedy and a bit of back to the future style scifi flair what i received was a beautiful and massively moving story about love not just romantic love although there is plenty of that also but also the love between siblings parents friends and even strangers warning this movie will make you cry but the end of this film will redeem any tears with an unshakable message about appreciating day to day life and how to appreciate the beauty we experience each day i was especially glad that this film dodges several old and annoying movie clichs that i expected to see as the film progressed in closing this film has an original storyline very talented actors and a genuinely moving power,happy
this movie is a great example of how unique films can get buried under the bad marketing of the hollywood machine if you know anything about this film prior to watching it chances are you think ait is about time travel and bit is a comedytime travel is a part of the storyline but this is not a time travel movie hence the disappointment and angry reviews from the scifi geeks who apparently felt the world needed yet another movie riffing on changes to the spacetime continuum and the butterfly effectbecause this is a british film it gives you a few laughs the british never take any subject completely seriouslysince what the film actually is defies the conventions of 2 minute trailers and 30 tv commercials hollywood hung its hat on the two things abovewhat the film really is about as the title says is about time it is a fatherson story in the vein of cats in the cradle the story makes many salient points about life specifically because it isnt bogged down with explaining in detail how the time travel which we all know is impossibly anyway so whats the obsession with the explanation scifi geeks worksit is what intelligent people would call a plot device a way to make points about love loss and life the men are the only ones who can travel back to make this a fatherson story and keep it focused the screenwriter made choices as to what he wanted his story to be people that is a good thingthe cast is all capable but they are not depended on to carry the story at any point so no performance really stands out if there is any flaw in the movie it is the lack of high drama at any point but the overall message of the film brought home at the end makes up for ita very good film the kind hollywood makes too few of probably because when the pitch comes across their desk they sum it up as time travel romantic comedy,happy
inception looper predestination x men days of future past interstellar dunkirk memento and pulp fiction hollywood and the moviegoers of the world have become enamored by the mind bending analysis necessitating complexity of nonlinear storytelling as viewers of these films we cannot lazily follow the string of the story we must be attentive and tenacious to grasp the full experience these films are beautifully knitted together perhaps as audience members we feel that we are the ones who untangle every loop and knot until we are left with individual strings the truth is we are not the ones doing the work that is not why people go to the movies people go to ward 16 consolidated theatres to lay back on new recliner chairs and munch on concessions not to solve mental mazes it is the job of the cast and crew to challenge us with the mystery and then politely present to us the answers we get the delightful sensation of solving a puzzle without doing any of the work perhaps we love the momentary struggle or maybe it is in our human nature either way we have grown heavily attached to this film genre directors such as christopher nolan and quentin tarantino have earned the respect of the common moviegoer with narrative complexity in their films the sheer amount of thought that goes into creating these narratives is unimaginable it takes extreme discipline and wit to remain within the structure of the film while dodging the plot holes these films have gained so much popularity that they have inspired writers and directors to create similar films so much so that some audiences youthful enthusiasms for the genre eventually withered out and turned into pessimistic annoyance about time was released when time travel movies seemed to pop up every week directed by richard curtis about time is a product of the popularization of time travel and nonlinear storytelling in hollywood the initial review by critics did not bode well for the film many pointed to the blatant plot holes within the film and with a 55 rating on metacritic and a 68 rating on rotten tomatoes only the rare enthusiast would admit the movie is above average however as time passed the movie gained popularity and became a surprise hit in south korea 93 percent of google users say that they like the movie the light hearted sentimentality of the movie caught the hearts of people across the globe despite its origins about time ignores the common narrative conventions of time travel and proves that the powerful combination of charm and self awareness can more than compensate for a neglect of structural rules those who are simply looking for a relaxing time at the movies will love about time about time was released during a period where time travel movies were very popular and almost becoming a gimmick in hollywood movies like hot tub time machine satirize this overuse of the time travel trope the movie pulls inspiration from movies like groundhog day that mix the scifi aspect of time travel with realistic everyday life richard curtis made a lot of romantic comedy movies such as love actually and notting hill during the initial release of the film about time many critics pointed out the plot holes that were left in the movie just one year prior another time travel movie looper was released many debated over the effect of plot holes on the quality of looper as well there is one video where the writerdirector of looper rian johnson is explaining the reasoning behind leaving the plot holes in that movie in the interview he states that the plot holes were a result of a conscious artistic choice he says there is a slight amount of magical logic that you have to apply in order to make a story like this make sense is this a valid statement or is rian johnson just rationalizing his inability to write a impermeable screenplay it would be unreasonable to assume a renowned writer such as rian johnson is lying about this furthermore rian johnson surely has the skills to write a plotholefree screenplay he broke into the scene with the critically acclaimed film brick and has gone on to contribute to blockbusters such as star wars the last jedi a writer of such expertise would not settle for anything less than excellent in his mind there is a very high chance that the plot holes in looper were indeed an intentional artistic choice there are parallels between about time and looper if we are compromising our logic to believe that a human can time travel by closing his eyes in the dark then why cant we use a little more of our magical logic to accept minor plot holesmost would agree that richard curtis was not trying to create a narrative masterpiece when he was writing about time this however does not mean that it is a low quality movie about time is delightfully charming and lighthearted the sentimental moments strike at perfect times with realistic dialogue and witty humor about time humbly reminds us to enjoy the seemingly unimportant moments in our own lives within the film the protagonist discovers how all of the men in his family have the ability to time travel after years of using his powers in self interest the protagonist realizes the limits to his powers and his father lets him in on his secret formula to happiness the fathers secret is that he only uses his powers to relive his life in the exact way he lived it the first time around the whole message of the film is to enjoy the little moments richard curtis wants the audience to simply enjoy life for what it is the film wants us as an audience to simply enjoy the film a charming quirky story the theme of the film compliments the simplicity of the story of course about time is not a narrative masterpiece but that was never the intent about time is very self aware the protagonist is very relatable he is not a buff overbearingly masculine character he is just an average awkward guy that happens to have the ability to time travel throughout the movie the protagonist tim played by domhnall gleeson predictably does what all of us wouldnt admit to doing if we were gifted the power to time travel a protagonist who has a 110 morality rating should not cause the movie to be 110 in quality many of these reviews fixated on the simplicity of the film as if simplicity is a bad thing ordinary was a word used a lot to criticize the characters as if ordinary is badatelevision shows like the office and parks and recreation are loved by america because they give us a peer into the lives of relatable characters relatability is what caused the office to become a sensation the movies are often represented as an opportunity to momentarily escape from reality but if someone were to say that movies should only function as an escape they would be terribly wrong films can function as an escape from reality but also as propaganda memorabilia education and more about time knows its intention and as a simple romcom it beautifully achieves its own goals about time sparks an interesting argument because there will be a point where interpretation of intent matters if we assume that the intention was to leave in the plot holes as a sacrifice to maintain the theme of finding beauty in mundanity then my argument would work on the other hand if we assume that there was no intent of having plot holes and it was simply a mistake then i would probably switch my argument however i have come to the conclusion that there was intent to leave in the plot holes because the simplicity of the story adds to the message of the movie moreover the movie does such a great job of camouflaging the plot holes and the chances of that being a product of coincidence is super low film traditionalists who despise plot holes should ask themselves a question why why would a plot hole ruin a film if its purpose is to remind the audience to enjoy the simplicities of life if a movie achieves its goal shouldnt it be considered a success for people who enjoy tv shows like the office or parks and recreation this movie would be perfect all of these shows have a theme that is based on finding the beauty in mundanity many people refer to movies similar to about time as guilty pleasures but it is perfectly within our right to enjoy simple films with simple goals,happy
you have no idea how amazing wonderful awesome this movie is you will be thankful every moment in your life after watching this movie literally,happy
about time gets a lot of flack from people who spot the plot holes or who are biased against richard curtis films before they even watch them for me though this is his best workits got everything the first half is classic curtis romcom weve got the bumbling brits the american girl he hopelessly chases theres supporting characters we fall in love with its all fun and lovelybut then along comes the second half that absolutely breaks your heart because the scenes between nighy and gleeson are so poignant for a film to have this much warmth and heart is a rare thingi cant recommend this film highly enough,happy
a beautifully written it covers so many genresfantasy drama a bit of scifi and love story and its not a love story in the traditional sense its a story about the lovethe love between the boy and his dad the boy and his sister the boy and uncle desmond the boy and his sturdy mum the boy and his wife the boy and his friends the boy and his childrenthe boy and his life its very rare that i will watch a movie over and over again but i have seen this movie at least a dozen times and it moves me each and every time these are not extraordinary people but you fall in love with them just the sameabsolutely beautiful film great date movie just bring tissues,happy
have seen quite a few time travel movies but this one beats them all on all grounds the plot the relevance of the time travel not overdoing it the characters soooooo beautifully played by all even the role of uncle desmond  who has such a short role to play in the movie plays it soooo convincingly and to the best of what the character demands the best of all  the dialogs you will tend to fall in love with them humorous witty and so beautifully written that it makes the movie watching experience an absolute delight and then the characters who are delivering these dialogs in a manner that i dont think i will like to see or hear in any other form than how it is done in this movie not much of a reviewer on imdb just a few one before these but this was one movie which i just wanted to pen down about with the hope that whosoever is reading it to figure out whether i should watch this movie or not can simply go and get that dvd right now without second thoughts you would have the most amazing 2 hours watching this brilliant movie enjoy,happy
upon watching this movie i wanted to dock the st out of it for its cornycliche moments so much so that it tricked me into disliking this movie when in fact i was thoroughly entertainedthe whole going back in time premise is a fun one for me especially in this context where the central character has the ability to do so and its just their secret i would be cool with this being a genre type premise which there have been a handful of movies along these lines and i typically enjoy them this time they did it was a romance theme so i guess corny and cliche goes with the territory it has an overabundance of awesome secondary characters as in everyone of them which kinda gives me reason to believe that this was entirelyoriginally a well written story as in limited cliche moments that got altered a bit in order to get the approval to be made probably went something like this were going to need a big name or up in comer actress for tims love interest so they bring in rachel mcadams who is dont get me wrong a great actress but holy st she doesnt belong in this movie in conjunction with that the studio likely meddled with the more central story of tim and mary clicheing it up for mass production thus leaving it surrounded by a record breaking level of awesome secondary charactersthe dad harry uncle tims two friends marys friend i really enjoyed the scene with tims uncle where he tells him that the best day of his life was when tims dad said that he loved him at the wedding so the news of his dad having cancer is probably the worst it was the manor of the uncle that was portrayed throughout that puts that moment into context tim is kind of a mixed bag for me the guy did a good job as an actor it was the writing for his character which gave me mixed feelings as to whether or not i liked the guy he kind of comes across as a bit pompouson a deeply philosophical note just be sure to live each day as though its your lasti cant believe they left us of on such a mundane note i feel like an abandoned orphan after that oh well had enough good points to be worth the watch,happy
absolutely my favorite loving movie of the past decade love every details and every line of it love the awkward but cute moment when dad told tim about their abilities love angry harry giving tim thehard time love the beautiful  brilliant lines from beginning to end i cry every time when tim and dad going to the beach together this is the movie i watch over and over again whenever im tired or a bit down it warms my heart and lift my spirit,happy
i dont know how we missed this movie but my husband found it on hbo and we watched it because we had an open night first of all i had no idea it was a richard curtis film im such a huge fan of his i love how he blends comedy drama romance and a really deep philosophical message about lifeand second i actually think this is my most favorite of his films the film had me from the opening shot and i remember thinking as im watching the first few minutes that this is some of the best writing ive ever heard and the performance by domhall gleeson is starturning im so used to seeing him as a villain in star wars that he completely caught me off guard with his endearing honest portrayali could go onandon great story great end message great acting great music great filmi wish i could go back in time and see it for the first time again and again,happy
what do you want from a feel good moviesimple  you should feel good after watching it that is exactly the movie about time gave mebelieve it or not it is a movie about time travel but it never felt like a scifi film at all it is about love and relationshipsthe love of a father and son love of a couple love of a brother and in short the story of some warm and loving people the story of a young man who is not an alpha male like a regular movie hero he is sensitive emotional and shy like most of us so the character feels so connected to methe movie shows his beautiful family and a beautiful romantic relationship which made me feel to have that in my life toomore than a movie it was a beautiful experience which made a lasting feel good feeling if you have some time for love and care and some soft emotions of life then watch it with your heart you will feel good and positive,happy
this is one of the most perfect british romcoms in existence for me its up there next to notting hill in that it has a perfect cast script and plot and the settings evoke so much nostalgia i would watch this again and again without ever tiring of it,happy
what a breath of fresh air to see such creative strides taken in the romance genre with this wonderfully crafted film directed and written by richard curtis a man who gets romance as well as he understands people i loved the messaging of this film and how the time we have with loved ones is precious not to be taken for granted its beautifully shot directed and acted and packs some great food for thought as well two up,happy
a cracker of a movie a movie to make you think about your own life about your own choices superb acting and great characters another fine example of the strength of the british film industry,happy
im vaguely familiar with richard curtis and his works ive seen 4 weddings and part of notting hill i am by no means an avid consumer of anything curtis i saw this one because an exgirlfriend from 25 years ago looked me up on social media to tell me that she had found my movie doppelgnger in domhnall gleesons character in this flick called about time so i had to check it outto be frank i am no where near as charming or clever or cute as tim she was wrong on that front but im so glad her message found me because this movie is amazingis it sentimental sappy romantic yes to all 3 and therefore not my normal cinematic fare the time travel aspect being thrown into a romcom story almost discouraged me from even giving it a chance but i had to see this british movie character version of myselfmy relationship with my father or lack thereof made this movie very personal and difficult to watch for me you see thats really the central most powerful key to the plot yes its a love story and its silly and whimsical and all that but tim and his father have the relationship that i strive every day to have with my son now 16 because its the missing thing in my life that left this giant vacancy in my soul and my life now largely revolves around ensuring that my son never experiences that vacancyi know this sounds more like an autobiography than a movie review so ill sum it up this way dont let the preposterous nature of the plot scare you away the time travel scenarios though silly and highly unscientific are crucial to the plot development if you are a son with a sons of his own this movie is for you anyone who says this is a chick flick missed the point and got it completely wrong this is a guy flick for guys who arent afraid of their own souls and the emotions that come from them ive watched it 3 times now and each time i cry a little less and smile a little more,happy
about time doesnt concern itself with the technicalities and science of time travel because it isnt a film that is about time travel about time rather is about life love and family its a film that speaks to the idea of slowing down and appreciating the world around us its a film that highlights the fact that there is magic in the mundane moments of life,happy
really exceeded my expectations i smiled through the whole movie and laughed out loud many timesjust delightful and original,happy
for me this is one of the best romantic comedies i also find it one of the saddest movies i have seen it gets me every time and i sob oh how i sob thank you richard curtis and all the cast,happy
because it is so real but also rarei love tim character clumsy sweet spontaneous as he is the chemistry between two main character is very natural the scenery in tim hometown is breathtaking the soundtrack completed the movie and everything else is just perfect for mewhat can i say after 5 years after my first watch i still like to rewatch this movie again,happy
of course we all perhaps all wish there was a way to go back and change something in our lives or anothers this movie touches lightly on the paradox of time travel for the travelers sake consequences yes others have attempted this  ie the butterfly effect et al about time adds a sweet spin on the concept i loved my own father and my own brother dearly and have lost them both way too soon years ago what i would give to go back and change one thing in their lives that would have perhaps gotten them through that fateful daywithout the sci fi special effects and explosions and cgi to speak of this movie takes us back innocently yes there are some selfish reasons portrayed initially who wouldnt do the same but he overcomes that to only want to help or better those around him ultimately realizing that each day is a new day and a chance to change our future for the better he gives up the time travel altogether this is a beautiful movie and reminiscent of adam sandlers clicklive your life today tomorrow to its fullest dont live to regret what has happened and grow old wishing you could change it love and hug and kiss those that mean so much to you cherish each day and each person you love life is fragile see this endearing movie 1010,happy
i dont not understand how people do not like this movie the story is told so incredibly well best writing ive seen in a long time in my opinion everything was so well thought out i was so moved by this movie i cried it is hands down one of the best movies ive ever seen from the casting to writing and to the way they edited the movie everything is just amazing and serves a very clear purpose this movie told an impactful story with very convincing characters,happy
obviously very far fetched however the plot is very charming the harmony of the characters is infectious one of my favorite romantic themed movies ever i love tim gleeson and mary mcadams as a couple and cheer for them the whole way throughfantastic score and the supporting cast is stellarits a sap fest so make sure your glucose levels are on par before watching ,happy
tone script  story the film is mostly a love story involving a guy now the special thing is this guy can travel in time or to be more specific the males in this family can travel in timei liked the script as it was developed surrounding a beautiful love story followed by matters that include family at a point i was confused with the sperm logic but thats what kept the movie going and so i accepted the terms i liked the whole story scenario with margot robbie as welldirection screenplay cinematography direction is good movie is better than love actually both are delivered to us by director richard curtis both the movies are carved out beautifullyfinal verdict it is a beautiful love story followed by charming terms with ones family you should definitely watch it and add it to your collection,happy
if you are looking for entertainment romance and a bit of scifi blended with a movie that makes you really think about life this is the movie with some elements of humour a real gem,happy
love the humour love the storyline my daughter and i keep watching it  its our favourite its an intelligent witty movie,happy
a sweet and relevant story about life love and living in the moment,happy
no matter how many times you jump around in timefrom your perspective anything that happened before that moment is in your pasteven if it happens to occur in the future of the world so if you go back in time and stop your kids from being bornthat happened in your past even if your kids are not born until the future happens so the main characters past is at times located in the future so it lets you undo any big mistakes i feel like they could have done more with time travel rather than being all romantic dont get me wrong i love the romantic side of the movie but he basically just decides that this woman is going to be his soul mateit was only the 2nd woman he ever liked and it was just too easy to woo her which made me think that he was going to find another love somewhere down the line but i am glad it stayed simple could you imagine how crazy it would be if he had a brother the father had multiple brothers didnt he wouldnt it have been super crazy,happy
at least thats what i thought before watching this one this movie does an excellent job showing whats going on inside tims mind as events unfold without getting cheesy in the narration bits a movie i will always come back to and never find myself getting tired of,happy
time travel has always been an intriguing idea in cinema and literature it was born out of human imagination no doubt and has been developed ever since we used to see the idea of time travel mostly in scifi films but in about time it is exclusively used as a side tool to reach happiness and to find love about time is a drama flavored romantic comedy that manages to put itself in a different place from the other films of the same genre because of its unique idea and 123 minutes of runtime the film is using time travel to show us that we dont need time travel to live our lives to the limits the main point of the film is not to travel in time but to teach us to live and enjoy our lives like it is our last day we are very much used to this concept of love and happiness in richard curtis films about time is both written and directed by him he made his directing debut with the highly recommended film love actually and with this film he has given clues about his directing and writing style and the ideas that are interesting to him up until this day with his films as a screenwriter or writer like bridge jones diary or nothing hill he hasnt failed to follow this path he was also nominated for oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen in four weddings and a funeralabout time tells the story of a boy at the age of 21 who discovers that men in his family can travel in time he takes this power and goes out to find a girlfriend and to seek for peace and happiness eventually he manages to have everything he has ever dreamed of without using time travel so as i have mentioned above the idea of the film is the possibility of happiness without time travel the film is so much focused on delivering this message that it ignores the other critical facts for example time travel is possible under very certain rules and breaking those rules means breaking the story and its logical flow for example one may ask why only men get to time travel it has nothing to do with sexual inequality but for the sake of the storys logical flow because if the women in the family could have traveled in time the story would have failed completely to keep it focused in the present day you cant travel back in time before you were born the components of making time travel possible are not very well thought and these bring the credibility of the film down however about time is a romantic comedy and a feelgood film dont be too concerned about the logic of time travel because as i have mentioned before this film is not about time travel but to show you how even time travel is unnecessary to be happy the director makes sure you get the message loud and clear by repeating it over and over which explains the length of the filmabout time is character based the chemistry between tim domhnall gleeson and mary rachel mcadams is so live and beautiful that you just want to get involved in their story the same thing applies for the conversations between tim and his father bill nighy as well this kind of acting is what richard curtis heavily depends on to transmit his message to the audience in this point of view his casting is successful about time is a twopart film first part is funny and romantic second part is dramatic and more serious this is also another characteristic of the film that separates it from the othersif we had a chance to go back and correct a mistake we have made we would be living our lives in a completely different way having only one shot in most of the cases doesnt allow us to live our lives to the limits this is a psychological fact and it is indirectly shared in the film under the transformation of tim from an insecure boy to a confident problem solver with its rich soundtracks from the cure to amy winehouse i have enjoyed about time it is going to make you feel good and recharged ask yourself the question of time travel if you had such power what would you use it for the answer you are going to give will reveal what you desire the most in your life time travel is an illusion and when you think about it you dont need it because you have been there before just value each moment of your life and live it to its limits this is one lesson about time is going to teach you,happy
it is very difficult not to like a starring bill nighy even the crappy ones get an extra star at least just for featuring him but about time is also written by richard curtis of love actually fame so there is only a tiny tiny chance the movie would not be good and then rachel mcadams plays in it too making it an instant hit so like other reviewers here i dont understand people implying they didnt like the movie ive just scientifically demonstrated that is impossibletime travel films are usually about two things alternate history and second chances alternate history is just a plot device for telling a science fiction story in a familiar environment while second chances films almost always talk about fixing past mistakes avoiding regret enjoying life this makes about time more amazing because it is actually almost devoid of the quasireligious platitudes relating to regret guilt and consequences it is about enjoying life it is about enjoying your friends and your family if you are lucky enough to have enjoyable ones like the dude in the film it is about enjoying rachel mcadams too but that shouldnt be too difficultbottom line a bit long at two hours and also having little to do with exploring the awesome power of time travel however it is a very pleasant romance and family movie with good solid humour but without trying to be a comedy and it is not one of those horrid christmas ghost things either luckily for us the lead character was a very nice guy as was his father and he didnt consider living his life then taking it from the start all over again with other people other children other hours of watching i recommend it,happy
if you like a love story and a bit of exiting fiction then you may surely like 2013s romantic drama about time you are an ordinary teenage guy and you posses some common age instinct to have a girl friend and you have missed lots of situations in your life of having a good girl friend during this time you come to know that you have an ability to travel back to time and set the things back into the track cool isnt it well then you began to use your super extraordinary power to set every situation perfect you will have successful love story better relation no bad times etc the concept is totally like you are controlling or better to say your correcting or directing your fate as you need the only caution is to be wise in using that power the overall story line is unique and catchy the lead pairs gleeson and rachel are very fine with their on screen appearance and performance the importance given to the character like kit kat and harry by tim shows the importance of relations story had been neatly portrayed the humor used in the movie is very hilarious and surely makes you laugh sound track is fine overall good gradable movie,happy
when i started watching this movie i was expecting a qualitative and fun romantic comedy but it was even better than that other movies stop where boy meets girl this movie didnt it takes some time to get used to that but once you get passed it you realize this movie is not just about two people getting together but about life and love in generalit remains entertaining and reaches out to interesting and meaningful themes but it never gets needlessly artistic or inaccessible this is a great movie to watch and watch again its funny and heartwarming i just love the way an absurd concept like time traveling and the way this power is used by the main character tells you so much more than the story on the surface it makes the movie stick with you for a couple of daysi recommend this to everyone the ones who love a classic romantic comedy as well as those who love a more meaningful challenge on screen especially if you love both go watch this,happy
just saw about time sheer brilliance of which has bowled me over its not only the best films i have seen recently but 1 of the best i have ever seen its a romantic comedy about the vicissitudes of life and love its witty clever intelligent and funny but its also a film of perhaps quite surprising depth the way it shows the relationships and describes it is simply outstanding richard curtis you nailed it perfect casting in this lovelybeautiful touching movie a must watch please sit with a tissue box cause you r definitely gonna cry like a baby during the end masterpiece it is and i can surely watch it for many more times,happy
if you could rewind time and go back to correct your mistakes making everything perfect next time around would you this is the basic conceit behind the latest british love storycomedy from love actually  notting hill director richard curtis with that pedigree most audiences will know what to expect although the high end nobody actually works has been toned down somewhatat the age of 21 tim domhnall gleeson rather socially inept and certainly challenged in the girlfriend stakes learns he has an inheritance instead of losing his father bill nighy and gaining a crusty old painting he gets to keep the old man and know the secret only the male line possess the ability to time travelfollowing the usual stages of disbelief and hiding in wardrobes he eventually lands at acceptance rather than money he utilises this new tool for love by trying to woo the girl of his dreams mary rachel mcadams the trick is used sparingly to start but over time becomes a regular feature of his lifethe film is peppered with the usual curtis trademarks good music great cast offbeat locations and a slight story but benefits from gentle performances from a quality castthere are touching moments especially for those perhaps deeper into their own life arc and no film with bill nighy in the cast list can ever be totally dismisseddomnhall and mcadams do good work initial misgivings about the chemistry between the leads gives way to something wholly believable as the pair grow into the roles together lindsay duncan as long suffering mother and tom hollander as harry both get a nod for fulfilling support duties wellthe film is arguably longer than it needs to be there is one later storyline that might easily have been excised to prevent the film overstaying its welcomea perfect date night movie with precious little to offend and should leave a smile on the face and maybe just a thought or two about seizing and enjoying every moment not deep stuff perhaps but arguably none the worse for a film aiming at pleasant and hitting the targetsummary enjoyable light undemanding yet wholly enjoyable entertainment with a warm heart stitched firmly to the sleeve perhaps eking a sneaky tear for those in the moodnot a curtis classic perhaps but likely to improve your evening and if not like tim you can rewind and try again until your mood is just right,happy
another reviewer wrote a wonderful review about this film but classified this movie as a dessert i would respectfully disagree i may have been in just the right frame of mind or seen it on the right day but to me this movie was exactly what i needed and it is indeed soul food i dont really feel the need to describe the plot the trailer does that well enough and the fact that i think it is a good move can be seen in my ratinginstead ill get a bit personal here but thats how much this movie affected me i just finished the day looking at apartments and different parts of a city with my parents im moving here in the fall for college and ill be honest it was a rough long day but then in our hotel room watching this movie the day completely changed as clichd as that may seem this movie touched me to in a way very few movies ever have and few ever will we all have those special movies that taught us how to be a better person or made use realize something about ourselves we never saw before about time is one of my movies i hope it is also one of yours because those movies are why i believe film exists beyond the ability to entertain they share with us a part of what it is to be human may you find that bit of transcendence in this film and if not may you find it somewhere else because we all need it from time to time,happy
i had read the reviews and thought lets give it a go to my surprise this film is the best i have watched for a long time thank you mr curtis and all the actors for an amazing film and i did cry at the end please forgive me if i am not use to providing reviews this film has brought me off the sofa to my laptop to say what i think about the film i will be honest and say i have never done this before and that tells its own story this film is just awesome from start to an amazing end thank you thank you i need to write more this film made me wonder why my dad did not want to know me and still to this day does not and the bond between father and son was so amazing i will never do what my dad did to me to my own son,happy
i have seen quite a number of time travel themed movies but this for me is the only one worth going back to to watch over and over again its a superb movie from start to finish thatll surely make you fall in love with the story and the characters what makes about time so special is that it has a little bit of everything love comedy drama fantasy and etc that has been combined to a perfect blend of a masterpiece full of heart and lessons the characters feel real with such raw emotions especially tim portrayed by domhnall gleeson and mary by rachel mcadamsthis is actually the first movie ive seen from richard curtis and yet im already blown away kudos to the makers of this absolutely lovely film definitely a mustwatch,happy
richard curtis is known as one of the greats of british comedy and romcoms creating characters like blackadder and mr bean and writing and directing love actually curtis has announced he is planning retire from directing and he takes a more serious turn with his last film about timetim lake domhnall gleeson is a 21yearold cornish man who is unlucky in love and lives his dad bill nighy mom lindsay duncan kooky sister kit kat lydia wilson and uncle desmond richard cordery the least intelligent man you will ever meet after a disastrous new years eve party tims father tells his son all the male in the family can travel back in time all they need to do is go into a dark spot concentrate and then they can go back to any point of his life when tim finds out about his powers he moves to london to start his career as a barrister and find a girlfriend he finds his soulmate in the form of mary rachel mcadams and he does everything he can to win her overdespite about times billing as a romanticcomedy its really a drama that has some comedy in it the comedy for the most part is gentle in nature revolving about some witty line awkward moments and character interactions gleeson does let out his inner hugh grant as hes awkward and easily flustered before being able to go back in time to rewrite his mistakes much of the humour comes from the time traveling antics that gleesonabout time does have a fine cast supporting cast but theyre used to various success tom hollander was the best as a highly aggressive easily angered playwright who was the most fouled mouth of all the characters nighy is his professional self as a more restrained character while still having some decent lines but wilsons character can easily be defined as kooky or quirky and the character of uncle desmond is a one joke character that he is not particularly smart and he could have been cut out of the filmat times about time did seem like it was going to have a theme about fate and destiny and that some actions are predetermined no matter what is altered a case in point is when tim keeps meeting with his old crash played margot robbie but all of that is undercut particularly when tim can manipulate events and when he is having to court mary over and over again coming across as the timetraveling stalkercurtis has had a great career as a writer but as a director he sometimes lacks restraint with about time a film that ends up being too long and overly sentimental curtis wanted to emotionally manipulate the audience into his way of thinking as he lays on his message of living life to the full particularly in the final actabout time does struggle to find a narrative as it starts out to be romcom with a scifi twist before turning into a romance and finally being a story about tim with his dad there are twist and subplots on the way with some clever concepts and unique looks on time travel but a good 20 to 30 minutes could have been cut as the end just drags and dragsabout time is a solid effort from curtis as it has a top cast with gleeson and mcadams having strong chemistry together which is what we want and expect from a romantic film the film does offer some laughs and a tranquil piano heavy score from nick lairdclowes with some decent pop music in the soundtrack but this is a film that is just too long and where many of the ideas could have effectively been done in a few short filmsplease visit wwwentertainmentfusecom,happy
nearly missed this because of a same old same old review in the times but hey i loved 4 weddingsyoud have to be v cold not to like this film its a wellspent wee part of your life time travel is a tricky one but this has a brilliant lightness of touch i laughed which i dont much do at films and i cried you want so much for the 2 mains to win outbecause you like them both so much curtis rocks end ofif youve lost your dad and somehow forgot to say i love you when they were alivethis may screw you up a little if you havent yet lost your dad  just find an excuse to say that you love them out loud,happy
this film was really the film of the year for me not much else beats it and hardly anything wrong with it it really ticks all the boxes that would fit to the genre and adds its own and ticks them off too what really struck me about this film was its ability to take all the regular thoughts of time travel and turn them on its head it really makes the point that time travel cannot solve the issues of anyones life if anything it complicates more in my opinion its a must see film no other way around it this film really put the icing on the cake in terms of films released 2013 shame it wasnt released closer to valentines day it would have made a perfect film to go see with a loved one,happy
i thought the trailers for this film looked pretty good the cast was good the concept seemed great and i thought it looked like a very unique indie love story i was right but i also understated it in my mind this film was brilliant magical sweet touching and emotional i loved every minute of it i laughed and cried and just have been thinking about the film ever sincea surefire sign of a great movie it is deep and important and has such a beautiful message about life and love some harsher reviewers call it unrealistic and a close minded vision of the world and perhaps it is a little neat and tidy but some people live neat and tidy lives and it doesnt do anything to take away from the fact that nearly anyone can find a message here to apply to their own life it is about seeing the beauty around you its the fact that this man can essentially change anything in his life but learns that true beauty is the way the world unfolds as it is it gives me chills just writing that this very well may have and should have made my best of 2013 list and i liked it enough that i just may amend my already posted list because this truly moved medomhnall gleeson is just about perfect as the bumbling adorable everyman tim he is just someone you can relate to he feels real he isnt a chiseled square jawed hollywood superstar and he gives this truly moving intense emotional performance that feels right it isnt an in your face obvious performance but a subtle role that grows on you the amazing rachel mcadams is the love of his life and they are stunning together mcadams seems to have this chemistry with the men in her films most of them that is compelling and riveting and passionate mcadams and gleeson on the surface may seem like an odd couple and yet that are a match made in heaven to watch like gleesons performance mcadams and their relationship feels genuine and real it is a little fairy taleesque but so what we all need a little fairy tale romance in our lives bill nighy is brilliantnuff said honestly this guy is just charismatic and stunning and you immediately connect with him and fall in love with him as tims doting father is he the personification of the perfect father yes againso what we dont watch films for reality i suspected and knew that death would play a part in nighys character and there were scenes prior to that where i was almost crying thinking about tim losing him he is enigmatic in this role lydia wilson is good as tims beloved and extremely quirky sister its sort of an odd role that doesnt quite fit in the film and yet she doesnt quite fit in her family so it makes some sort of sense in the grand scheme of things she still adds a level of fun to the cast and shes good lindsay duncan richard cordery and joshua mcguire are decent in very small supporting rolesi am genuinely shocked that director richard curtis has so few credits to his name as director that being said love actually is considered a modern day holiday classic i have yet to see it and pirate radio is also considered great by some he is a terrific writer having penned some truly outstanding work but he clearly has a handle on his own screenplay here the cinematography behind this love story is lovely in its own right the british scenery is serene and beautiful the film is quirky and funny and awkward and then beautiful and emotional and just deep if you really inspect it there were so few errors in the film though i think youll find as i did that youll be asking yourself a few key questions like why he and his father never tell anyoneespecially the women they adore so much the addition of transporting another person in time was rather unexplained and perhaps unnecessary but im grasping at negative straws because i have to go with my gut and how much i enjoyed this i thought the pacing was perfect and it was just a wonderful romance about love and life i am forever enamoured with about time 910,happy
about time is full of really nice people who love each other and you want nothing but good things for all of them and that often turns out to be possible thanks to the lake family secret all the lake men have a limited ability to travel backward in time  only to earlier points in their own lives true we cant go back and kill hitler or anything but usually getting a 2nd run at various awkwardnesses and infelicities is all it takes to smooth out lifes little bumps and joltsaside from the time travel the biggest imaginationstretcher is that rachel mcadamss mary is a single gal in london in her early 20s and doesnt have a boyfriend our hero the gawky but endearing tim lake domhnall gleeson recognizes the cosmic injustice in that and determines to use his powers for good or in this case love but between his wistful adieu from the shy plain girl hes met in a lightsout bistro and getting set to call the number shes punched into his cell phone he performs a good deed for a friend and it turns out that his little jaunt into the past has erased his evenings conversation with mary from her memory and her number from his phonethats about the highest level of stress this film ever reaches its the farthest thing on earth from an actionadventurer its mainly a love story with minor elements of comedy sometimes it takes several reruns at the past to get things just right and we see the failed attempts in quick succession and pathosits written and directed by richard curtis who earlier did about a boy and notting hill so you know hes got the characterization down cold and bill nighy lydia wilson lindsay duncan tom hollander richard cordery and margot robbie are pitchperfect in supporting roles and if i didnt emphasize it strongly enuf earlier youll really like all of these people even the crusty curmudgeonly playwright harrygo see the movieyou wont be sorry you can thank me later,happy
film making is just getting to be such a precision art in the digital age this movie gets the highest marks for originality do not sit down to watch this movie thinking that you are watching one of those worn out plots that you have seen before there are a handful of plot twists that are flawless subtle and unguessable which speak to the deepest heart of us all as human beings if the originality doesnt win you over and take you for a delightful little movie viewing ride the flawless writing and eye for detail as directed will certainly earn your respectthis movie belongs in the artsy class of movies because of its writing but it achieves something not usually seen in an artsy movie it is mainstream quality blockbuster quality a superb date film a wonderful family film and something that possibly has the power to uplift even the most stubborn of us it achieves all of that without ever being trite corny or even unbelievable see it with your family your date yourself or whomever it cannot disappoint you,happy
this movie is beyond standards we are used to it is warm human story and time traveling part is brilliantly incorporated only cinematography masters can pull this kind of story into a good movie but this movie is not good its excellentcasting is perfect dad and uncle are simply brilliant in their performances i really enjoyed every single minute and had a few good laughsthis movie is not for funaction packed movie loversi think it showed that you dont have to have special effect circus if you are doing a time traveling movie rachel mcadamss performance is not in the range of all the other actors and actresses but never the less it is acceptable,happy
greetings viewers welcome to the saccharine world of richard curtis where just like all his other cinematic concoctions love conquers all and life is fulfilled  as long as you happen to live in a fantasy version of london where a its always summer b you live in the incredibly expensive st johns woodmaida vale area c ethnic minorities are nonexistent d everyone has a middle class job in law the arts or publishing e children never cry  they are just massively cute all the time f you have wealthy parents rattling around in a huge house by the sea g you have a kooky sister and an eccentric uncle for comedy relief and h you are a less handsome but not unattractive ginger version of hugh grant curtis storytelling template never waivers from the success of four weddings and notting hill and this derivative bilge is the 21st century equivalent of all americans still think london is foggy lit by gas lamps and transported by horse and carriage oh and dont forget  if you need a passage of time lets have a montage set to a bland love song that takes place in a single location the writers claim that no adjustments are made to suit us cinemagoing sensibilities is plainly untrue one of the most truly awful shamelessly manufactured examples of cinematic product ive ever had the misfortune to witness,happy
imdb reviews never cease to astound me great films get low scores terrible films get great scores  guess which one this is about time is bland pointless and just sits there on screen doing absolutely nothing theres nothing involving about the plot no characters you give a toss about and its long long longthe entire premise of the time travel idea is underused and almost seems like an afterthought for the movie the ginger leading man is also mildly irritating and not much fun to look at his pluminthemouth dialect being representative of the kind of people in england who are generally extremely annoying too to you americans reading this almost no normal person in the uk speaks like that  just the over privileged true im no fan of romcoms but many are sufferable if they at least manage to hold your attention for their under 90 minutes running time but 123 minutes of blandness im afraid not i just sat there wondering when something was going to happenand then the yawns set inits so unsettling that so many people here have given this drab grey shade of a movie ten stars and calling it the best film youve ever seen cmon honestly people can you just not make statements like that on here anymore i mean please you really are contributing nothing as it shows just how few films youve ever seen the title however for the film is actually brilliant because when it finally dragged to the end i cheered out loud about time,happy
the sad thing was that this film started off really well i was enjoying it in the moment and  absolutely nothing happened it seemed to be a story about a character who used his time changing powers to change silly insignificant things  like how good he is in bed and so much of the plot is wasted with those things that there is very little real story about two thirds of the way through there is finally some action when the protagonists sister is involved in a car accident but again this really does little to further the plot point i personally believe this story would be better suited to have been a romance marrying the happy couple off right away was a mistake in the plot and leaves little room for adventure this is just one of those films that has so much potential but misuses it not a patch on love actually or notting hill 2 stars from this user,happy
i simply cant believe the ratings on this movie i cant remember the last time i was so bored how can someone with time travel powers still remain such a pathetic loser  i could not find any redeeming features about this movie you dont really care for any of the characters and there is hardly anything in the way of any special effects for the time travel sequences which may take your mind off an otherwise drab experience and lifeless scriptthere is nothing the main character does in this movie that any ordinary person doesnt do namely he has lots of kids and goes back and forward in time to accomplish this bravo great achievement mate jolly well done  either watch paint dry or watch this movie all the same,happy
there are a number of times while watching this film when i wondered what the point was when it was finally spelled out to me then i realized weve reached the end of the film i find the best films have subtext that isnt spelled out to us or aimed to hit us on the head like a hammer i find that the latter as a heavyhanded way of portraying a message or emotion and thats what the powers that be decided this film to be which is a shamethats not to say that the acting was awful i believe the acting was in a lot of scenes heartfelt and sincere that likely has more to do with their strength as actors than the actual script however which i thought was rather weak bill nighy channels his billy mack character from love actually by the same director this time as a father figure not much of a stretch for his considerable acting chops but he manages to sell it nonethelessthe whole affair is light and breezy not particularly memorable which brings me back to my original point about the message being sledgehammered to the head perhaps the filmmakers thought that the filmgoer would feel the same way i do and decided to force the message in order to provide some sort of moral that is supposed to bring all this forgetful affair together and therefore make it memorable the message itself while commendable is fairly underwhelmingi had a somewhat pleasant experience watching this film dont get me wrong however i have no desire to see this film again and im glad i didnt pay full price to see it,happy
if you liked groundhog day and big fish i think this is the kind of film you would really like i recommend this film highly to heart firstemotional types of people but it may not be a good choice for those who dont fit that descriptionthis is a film about heart there are some plot holes but if you get lost in the science of this filmwell then youll miss the heart and art of it its a film about family each character is flawed and real as the film went on i cared more and more about each of the characters who became people i felt like i knew this is an emotional journey to say the least and while i rarely cry when watching films this one got me a few times happy and sad tears life tears i guess you could say,happy
ill start this review by saying that i liked blackadder four weddings and a funeral notting hill and even love actually so i knew what i was likely to get with a richard curtis film the first part of about time when tim the protagonist tim its a bit like tim innit was with his family discovering what he can do with time travel was actually really quite good a bit richard curtis by numbers right down to the ditsy flower child sister but fun nonetheless the scene where tims dad who also has the same powers describes how this works is actually one of the better scenes in the movie then tim moves to london where he becomes a lawyer lots of fun could be had with time travel and studying for exams but somehow we dont have that  tim becomes qualified enough to be in court in wig and gown in what appears to be a serious fraud trial somehow without any work actually taking place but thats nitpicking for a rom com another fun side character is introduced in the grumpy playwright  who characterwise bears a remarkable resemblance to acting banker from notting hill then we are treated to an overlong getting to know you scene which takes place in an in the dark restaurant  which means we the audience are left looking at a black screen with voice over for what feels like forever i am sure this is meant to be enchanting and touching but actually i found it dull and boring and the oh yay youre not ugly scene immediately afterwards just feels forced more jumping around time highjinks coupled with an overlong montage showing tim and mary falling in love moving in together and so on with a bad busking band playing in the background it was difficult not to compare it to the passingoftime montage in notting hill which was much more effective  this just dragged on and the music was headacheinducing during this sequence we also have a ridiculous strip tease from mary  who declares that she will take off her clothing for tim if he makes decisions about their upcoming wedding it felt particularly gratuitous and completely unnecessary  it didnt even work as a comedy moment tim and mary have a child and its all lovelythen the ditsy sister  who is very reminiscent of scarlett from four weddings  ends up in trouble yay for tim and his magic powersbut he discovers that by going back to the past to save his sister he loses his daughter  who has magically become a son a quick check with tims dad and tim learns a very important lesson  if you travel back past the birth of your children then the children can change so tim jumps forward changing his new son back to his old daughter and leaving ditsy sister to her fate although luckily it seems that a lifetime of domestic abuse can all be rectified if mary stares at you very hard another child and then the requisite death  tims dad has cancer and tim gets to discover that magic time travel skills dont save you from cancer  or maudlin nick cave songs being played at your funeral mary decides to have a third child  and tim decides to go back in time to see dad again before child number 3 is born  he knows he cant go back after this without risking changing the new child when he sees his dad its quite a touching scene  which dad then ruins by trampling all over the very important lesson  tim and dad go right back to when tim himself was a child this is perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film  not that i was expecting any kind of sensible plot but at least curtis could have stuck to his own time travel rules the film felt overlong  and entirely as if it was written for hugh grant the tone and mannerisms and character of tim were very similar to the characters grant has played for curtis  but of course grant is far too old now for this role everything felt like a pale imitation of other better curtis moviesi genuinely cant recommend this film at all  a terrible shame,happy
in cornwall the clumsy tim lake domhnall gleeson lives a pleasant life with his family but he is awkward with the girls and unlucky in love at the age of twenty one his father bill nighy discloses a family secret to him telling that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time the skeptic tim finds that his father is telling the truth and when he moves to london to work as a lawyer he falls in love with the insecure mary rachel mcadams and seduces her fixing his mistakes in the relationship along his life tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors but also in the lives of his relatives and friendsabout time is an overrated movie about a clumsy guy that discovers that he has the ability of traveling in time and uses his skill to fix mistakes in life the plot is a sort of butterfly effect of love but is repetitive and tiresome the lovely margot robbie and the smile of rachel mcadams save this movie from a fiasco since domhnall gleeson is too dull for a lead role my vote is sixtitle brazil questo de tempo matter of time,happy
ill admit straight off that i hate richard curtis with a passion generally reserved for massmurdering dictators but i was willing to give about time a fair chance and see whether he could in fact charm me i was wrong and howfrom the start he makes the bile rise in your stomach theres a character called kitkat who is always barefoot her family have sunday lunch on the beach all year round no matter what the weather they even watch a film projected onto a rock on the beach in the rain but things get much much worse curtis basically recycles scenes and ideas from all his previous crimes sorry films we get the eccentric older family member the kooky friends the cute and nondescript american girl wooed in a fantasy london the births a death and of course a ing wedding mawkish music on the soundtrack tells us when to be happy when to be miserable the cynicism of the project and the vapidity of its intentions would be unbelievable were it not for curtiss previous form do not see this film watch a hitchcock a kubrick a wilder something that is proper cinema this is an abomination a dreadful lazy meandering actually quite nasty how on earth did a film with numerous fwords get a 12 in britain vomitcausing stupid slice of celluloid which if there was such a place as hell would be shown there on a loop,happy
the movie is meant to be a chickflick sort of affair and my wife and i were all for it however i left the theater with my intelligence being fully insulted the creators of the film should not be able to abuse the rules of their fictional account to the benefit of simply moving a story forward especially rules theyve created themselves the suspension of disbelief was shattered and in movies dealing with time the awe and majesty of such an ability were never truly conveyed not even in terms of love and endearment furthermore the moral quandaries of time travel and eternal life were abruptly placed together near the end of the film but the message was not earned lastly this was not an original idea ground hog day did it betterthe trailer for this movie was phenomenal the idea to travel through time via ones memory was fascinating however this movie broke all of the rules in temporal time travel including the rules for time travel used during the moviefirstly there was an underlying impression that only the men of the family could travel through time this rule was broken when the main character took his sister back through time second there was a rule that he couldnt travel to the future however when one goes to the past to change something the future is also permanently affected yet in the film he manages to go to the past and to this new future that no longer exists that he was no longer a part of seamlessly to tie together the first broken rule how far back did he need to go in order to undo how he changed his sisters pastfuture how did he end up in a future he had erased third one could potentially live forever the movie put a constraint on this as it nicely put an emphasis on developing relationships with his family however the mortality of it all even when dealing with his fathers death really suicide is hardly ever dealt with considering the scope of their powers fourth during the love scene he makes a joke that presumes he is tired but how can he be tired if he traveled back in time other then retaining his memories all other aspects of his physical wellbeing his energy levels and his health should all be unaffected there were other fundamental flaws the love between his wife and himself felt highly onesided she seems to have settled for him as soon as he managed to interject her path the main character persistently leads a double life since he never tells his wife about his abilities in other words his love is a lie and arguments and all other incidents involved in real love could be avoided for example during their first argument his reaction was to run away and turn back time the powers to travel through time were kept acutemeaning that the guy never used it to better society or the world at large everything felt sosmalland the gravity of the ability was never truly felt,happy
the main love characters chemistry was ugh just so awkward i cringed the whole time the male character was actually a justfinishedpuberty redhead funnylooking boy and the female rachel mcadams a lovely mature adult women she looked at least 10 years older than the male character their chemistry was pretty much nonexistent and their interactions were awkward that was all wrong then it was downhill from therethe only thing that made this film remotely interesting was watching rachel mcadamscomplete flop i couldnt finish watching it,happy
about time sells itself as a time travel romantic comedy its more about relationshipsa relationship between father and son brother and sister and two people who meet and get married there is also some time travel involvedrichard curtis writer and director has some form when it comes to time travelhe wrote a critically acclaimed episode of doctor who in 2010tim domhnall gleeson is a shy and awkward teenager especially when it comes to the ladies on his 21st birthday his father bill nighy unveils a family secret the men in the family can travel back in time in their life streamsoon tim embarks to london to become a lawyer he resides with a rude playwright and when a date in the dark goes awry tim decides to use time traveltim meets mary rachel mcadams and they establish a relationshipthe film is not a laugh out comedy it is a mixture of romance drama melancholy with a few laughsthere are the usual ingredients that you find in a curtis film the upper middle class with an eccentric family a large house by the seaside this time musical interludes a spiky and kookie young female character and romance with a transatlantic starthe time travel element is new to be fair to curtis he has thought about cause and effectthe best scenes are with tim and his father it is a genuine warm relationship so you can guess that his father is going to bite the dusti never got any chemistry between gleeson and macadams dom was very good in the early scenes when he is young and vulnerable but he could not sell it when his character got older and had childrena good time waster but it had very little substance,happy
about time might just be the greatest story told on screen everything that is right about this movie feels a bit lost in these times whereas the timelessness and simplicity depicted rarely is experienced the acting is amazing from the slightest background actor to our leads i would put this on a top 10 of the best movies made i would maybe also exclude people who is not into the emotional and heartfelt movies also the setting would not have worked any other place than england amazing team and an amazing cast,happy
such a lovely movie that leaves you with a lasting feeling of bless a desire to live your life more consciously and suddenly i miss my dad so much,happy
its very brilliant a film with a moral lesson put in the nicest way poeeible i found myself going back in my mind in time to moments where i would act in a different way which you can make up for now,happy
short and simple review by wubsthefadgerfirst off the only romance films i have ever truly like were the before series films this film is a touching and very original story the dealing with time travel is never explained which kind of a downer is but the romance story is moving and powerful the film elegantly introduces us to the characters and lets us connect with them we see their personalities and their love of family the ending is touching and really hit homethe acting is very good domhnall gleeson and rachel mcadams have great chemistry and both perform very well bill nighy delivers a very sobering performance as a loving father about to lose his son lydia wilson lindsay duncan richard cordery joshua mcguire tom hollander margot robbie will merrick and vanessa kirby all are great side characters that add so much to the storythe pacing of the film is slow but it introduces us to the time travel aspect very early the runtime is a little overlongpros touching powerful and original plot great ending domhnall gleeson and rachel mcadams and their great chemistry good side characters and bill nighy and his story is very touchingcons the ability to time travel are never explained slow pacing and an overlong runtimeoverall rating 82,happy
absolutely brilliant touching and comedic when it needed to be the acting was on point as you might expect from a peter curtis movie the characters where charming and easy to relate to and they quickly made me very emotionally attached to this masterpiece i absolutely adored john bodens take on how long will i love you originally sang by ellie goulding i believe it really fit in well with the movie as did the other music another thing i really liked about this film was how quickly it got to the point and didnt linger at the beginning almost immediately you learn about tims ability soon after it then leads you promptly into the main body of the movie the ending was satisfying to say the least and it really left me feeling great and as though i had been on a journey all in all i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a feel good romantic comedy,happy
about time from 2013 is a beautiful story beautifully tolda young man tim lake domhnall gleeson learns from his father that he can travel in time its a gift shared by all the men in the family and kept secret from anyone else all he has to do is find a dark place clench his fists and decide what he wants to relivehe cant alter history but he can redo certain incidents so he does better the one thing he wants is a girlfriend moving from cornwall to london to work as an attorney he meets the pretty sweet mary rachel mcadams and after a doover develops a relationship with her and they begin to build a life togetherthough his gift comes in handy saving his playwright friend from an opening night horror his wedding from awful best man speeches and helping his sister this took a couple of time hops tim finds that his gift cant keep him from lifes inevitable sorrows im tempted to say this was a lovely movie where nothing happens except that life happens in all its happiness and poignancy and bittersweet moments its the kind of movie that can make a man cry the emotions are so realive never been a huge fan of bill nighys who plays tims father  i have seen in dozens of films he is wonderful here as a funny loving father lindsay duncan a fantastic actress  i saw her on broadway in private lives is great as tims motherrachel mcadams always reminds of jennifer garner which is a compliment to garner since shes a bit older mcadams has a sweet gentle presence and shes delightful in this filmthen we get to the lead domhnall gleeson as tim a somewhat gawky young man who projects warmth and humor that really carries this filmthe rest of the cast is topnotch lydia wilson richard cordery joshua mcguire and tom hollandera magical film about lifes journey whether you can time travel or not,happy
about time 2013 is a romantic movie directed by richard curtis who made several famous romanticcomedy movies such as love actually in 2003 and notting hill in 1999 he also won several awards like christopher award this movie is a romantic comedy but it is touching and instructive which is quite different to richard curtiss other movies the plot is tidy and neat and the soundtrack was really harmonious with the filmthe main character tim played by domhnall gleeson is a normal man born in the countryside of england when he turns 20 his father bill nighy tells tim that his family has the ability to travel through time however his family had faced difficulty due to this ability because they used it to get fame or money so he decides to use this ability for love therefore he uses this ability to meet mary rachel mcadams who will be his wife they get married and enjoy their life however some things go badly so tim goes back to fix them but when he tries to save one important thing he realizes he loses another important one he should make a choice one and abandon the precious things in lifethis movie is really wellmade because it teaches us a lot of lessons and makes us think about the important things in our life there are no special effects or sets but it makes the movie more realistic the most outstanding aspect of the film is the wedding of tim and mary in this scene the camera catches the beautiful scene in the wedding the couple looks so happy that audience will admire that wedding and the wedding scene also makes us happy whats more in this scene the soundtrack makes the atmosphere better the plot starts with love but it expands to the meaning of life this skillful movie will make you feel the love of family farewell form family and happinessabout time is the last movie of richard curtis who was a master of romantic comedy movies this movie uses time traveling so you may know this movie emphasizes the importance of time like other plain movies but i think there is no other movie as touching and memorable we know we will die in the future and this movie awake us about the value of our life and time i recommend you to watch this movie for lessons that cannot be learned easily,happy
10 stars about time is the ultimate chick flick the love match between tim and mary domhnall doughinull gleeson and rachel mcadams will be a thing of legend they are not a list heartthrobs like pitt and jolie but their offbeat adorableness makes them lovable and relatable we ourselves with proper diet and exercise could possibly be as lovely as they are so we identify with them from the getgothe gag is that tim and all the men in this family have a special gift of being able to go back in their own past just by wishing to do it but not the historic pastonly the past that they are personally part of whenever they feel the need to so that they can redo things to correct anything that went wrong sound familiar yes this is definitely a rip off of groundhog day and some purists may find it to be an artistic nono to borrow from a film so beloved but its not exactly the same because they dont only redo the same day they can go back to their childhood or yesterday of course as with all timetravel movies we have to avoid asking any of those annoying butterfly questions about screwing up world reality or the reality of what is in the time travelers mind after he comes back from changing the past like what else changed in between but tim never changes anything too far back or world shatteringmostly recent little things like changing the way he talked to a girl or moving strategically to a different room in order to avoid meeting somebodythere are two major relationships in this movie the boygirl love affair and the father and sons mutual adoration we may cry a lotnot for them but for ourselves thinking maybe unconsciously how much better we wish our fatherson relationships werehad been boy oh boy tim and dad hug a lot and even kiss and we love them for it if we can get past our own pain dad doesnt use his time travel power to make a killing in the stock market his uncle got filthy rich and ended up miserable and alone no dad goes back to summer afternoons so that he can read more of the classics than its humanly possible to read in a normal life time hes a retired professor how did he buy that house old moneythere is one little beef i have with this idyllic tale this is a privileged family of leisure with a small mansion on the beach and they dont have seem to have any of the problems that we huddled masses have except for the relentless march of time that we are all subject to they are white thin healthy comfortable well employed tim goes to london to become a lawyer and they are all able to enjoy games of tennis and walks on the beach and seemingly without any stress from one another or the outside world okay the daughter drinks a bit too much but the family remains loving and happy like the nelsons or the cleavers sorry for the old reference im 62this privileged life allows tim to worry about girls without being troubled by all the nuisances that may bother the rest of us and the two leads are so infectiously adorable and their friends and colleagues are so much fun that we go on the ride that sails by like a dream its a cinematic delight with beach landscapes cliffs the ocean beautiful homes and apartments in both london and cornwall and parties filled with lovely furnishings and sexy lads and lasses the two lead actors are topnotch and so is bill nighy as dad they are so invested in one another so we smile we laugh we get mistyeyed we cry and finally we sob if we are not afraid to over their triumphs joys infatuations loves and the pains that even the privileged are occasionally heir toim glad i watched it at home alone because i dread coming apartlike i didin a crowded theater i imagine that many manly young men will slake this movie because of how expertly and relentlessly it presses ones buttons but i for one think richard curtis is a genius and im glad he pressed mine,happy
this film is funny moving and genuinely beautiful it is richard curtis at his best being witty unabashedly sentimental and altogether english the england he depicts is rather more beautiful and idiosyncratic and eccentric and charming than anything resembling the real england but i find it hard to be upset with this depiction when it makes you long to live there toohowever fair warning i rarely cry at films and its rarer still that i write a review but i felt that i must for this film so as to share this disclaimer you will at best cry during this film at worst you will be ugly sobbing for forty five minutes throughout the entire latter third i cried so much my entire face was wet even my forehead although that should have been impossiblethat said i do highly recommend this film,happy
this moviewas just amazing finally a fresh movie something that hasnt been done to death this was a movie that had me from the get go we all wish we could redo a moment just as its happening i loved loved loved this movie domhnall gleeson was just adorable in every sense of the word in this movie he went from just a goofy awkward ginger to a really delicious man as the movie progressed i was so madly in love with him by the final credits just put him on a white horse and it would be a fairy tale bill nighy as his father was brilliant casting they really had a spark that very rarely is seen in fatherson relationships on screen sheer perfection im not a big fan of rachel mcadams but she did a great job fitting in perfectly what a brilliant smart beautiful love story,happy
one of the best and probably the best romanticcomedyrelationship based movie i have watched everything is so perfectly placed that i can not argue the way i think what should happen next in the movie exactly that happens which is not a very common thing love all the scenes and the moments which he travels back in time are perfect the things he changes waoooo rachel mcadams you rocks specially the scene when he runs back to her apartment and says mary will you marry me breath taking actually from starting till end the story line and cinematography is so strong that it bounds you and you never feel like bored amazing amazing and amazing movie do watch it,happy
i watched this movie with my young teen daughter who is just discovering how clueless and wellmeaning the young men in her life are there is a freshness and charm about allowing a young man to bumble through his relationships and life trying again and again to learn lifes lessons about choosing the right words and deeds to carry out his good intentions wouldnt we all like to have a second or third take on some of the key scenes in our teens and twenties the women in the film do revolve around the men but they are more than cheerleaders they have depth and love and autonomy finally the fatherson relationship is worth the price of the ticket our sons and brothers and fathers need honest bumbling believable film role models to help them forgive themselves and love each other this film accomplishes that,happy
i honestly came into this movie with low hopes i had no idea what it was about but i am a rachel mcadams fan so i thought id give it a try i had never heard of the main character so i didnt know what to expect however after seeing this movie he is now one of my favorite british actors im going to try and keep this short and sweet and get to the point this movie is unbelievably sweet and charming and unforgettable it has its quirky moments but they totally make the movie bill nighy is a favorite of mine and the relationship he has with his son in this movie is heartwarming all i say is get through the movie to the end you will not be disappointed oh and the movie soundtrack is pretty amazing too,happy
first of alli have to say i watched this movie with completely no idea what was the movie aboutso when i was watching it i really forgot time and place where i wasthe movie was so good that i couldnt skip even the end creditsi have to tell you that its my first review in imdbso you can understand how good this movie is and how much i liked itby the end of movie you will have peaceful mind and youll rate it and give a review tooi am huge fan of rachel mcadamsshe was the reason i watched this movie in the first placewas the perfect person who could do that roledomnhall gleesonwell im surprised i didnt expect this good performance by himthey both made the movie so real that it was like i was with them all the time looking at all the things by sitting right beside themof course not the sex part i wishbut overall the movie is worth watching many times whenever you are sad and bored,happy
when you choose to watch a romantic film clearly you expect it to be about the two individuals that the advertisement or trailer focus on and you also expect that the film will follow these two individuals as they embark on their romantic journey towards finding love in one another well this is that kind of film and at the same time it is not surprisingly this is a film about love but not just about romantic love this film encompasses the beauty of all love love for your family your friends and for your lifeit left me not focused on the awe of finding true love but on the beauty and importance of all personal relationships in your life i laughed a lot more than i expected and cried for all the reasons i did not expect to cry this is the type of film that will leave you thinking more about your life and the choices you make,happy
i am a fan of rachel mcadams so when i heard there is a movie with her and time travel and similar concept i had to watch it and those who liked the time travelers wife should too i must say i am impressedthis movie is a fantasy where domhnall gleeson about whom i didnt even know much before this movie and am thinking right now that nobody could do this better than him got to know that he has the ability to travel back in timeso we cannot say that it is a new concept but when i heard that he uses his ability to get the girl my decision to watch this movie was shaken so when i started watching it i had no expectation of originality at all maybe this is why i liked it even moremy favorite part of the movie were the conversation between gleeson and mcadams they were sweet and witty at the same time sometimes it felt like the film is dragging and carrying unnecessary detailing with the core story but it all sorted out quite fastso those who would like a sweet fantasy with a little romance and family drama they will like this too,happy
you must watch this moviedoesnt matter what it takes the route is the same for all the people and is just a decision to feel and enjoy the present the paper of bill nighy goes smooth driving the movie and story to all the existential questions of a regular life and answering with examples and practices in the dairy life of domhnall gleesonthe art of cinema happens when the imagination blows up and even after finish to watch the movie exist the message and the 5 human senses are awake and in this drama everything is mixed for get the taste in the lips and the motivation for going to the next levela master piece,happy
well usually i give a high votes to the movies mostly 69 but very rarely 10 and this movie deserve 10 absolutely everything is perfect theres a really interesting storyline that makes sense its light and quite emotional and it has a perfect simply production  great picture great music even great titles i love this movie and i totally recommend it to watch its tells the truth of life but in the same moment it gives us a hope for better brilliant life it contains that source that we need in our life and which i think we are waiting from movies and other arts but despite this its not getting us a false hopes definitely not its about time time is one of the most important complex and non understandable things in our life and this movie tries to give some point of view to this thing and i think they succeeded in it they explained some things about time of course its impossible to tell all about time in the movie but it gives us a strong point of view to the time thing and a strong hope to the future to the next day,happy
i feel that moviegoers have begun to lose sight of what movies truly are movies were created to not only entertain but to try to invoke some sort of emotion joy sorrow anger etc if a movie accomplishes something of the sort with a large portion of the audience they have succeeded nowadays it seems that all movies are being put through the academy awards lens not all movies are being released with the intention to win awards and while i know many people will disagree with the point i am trying to make about films i think a film deserves praise if it sufficiently invokes emotion about time is one of those moviesi need to preface this by saying that the made up genre name of chick flick is completely ridiculous now with that in mind i went into this movie having been told that it was indeed a chick flick now i realize that many movies that are described using this phrase are not all that stellar my expectations were low to say the very least the surprise that i received was extremely welcomefrom the beginning with the initial narration from tim domhnall gleeson i knew this was going to be a different movie maybe it was knowledge that this film was filled with actors and actresses from the united kingdom but i immediately had a good feeling that is how movies should make us feelit would be easy to pick out what all the film did right for instance the characters were believable and the cast interacted perfectly on screen i regained a little respect for the quick wit of sharp dialogue delivery of rachel mcadams that had been lost after her performance in mean girls bill nighy solidified why he is one of my favorite british actors the story itself was believable even though it tackled the immensely tricky issue of time travel there was indeed tension where there needed to be tension humor where there needed to be humor and then a serious punch to the gut where a serious punch was necessary overall the film was pieced together brilliantlyto me though it wasnt the film itself that makes me give it the high praise it wasnt really even the message to me it was the development of characters and relationships that makes this movie phenomenal one of the crucial points in most every movie is whether or not the characters portrayed can interact with one another in a way that is entertaining and believable this movie hinges on its relationships working and it succeeds brilliantly he begins the narration at the beginning by talking about his family and his opinion of each of them it draws us in and soon we can hardly look away yes there is also the romance that makes this film a chick flick but it is tackled in a completely fresh and new way however it also touched on the issue of negative relationships with kit kat lydia wilson and jimmy kincade tom hughes but instead of the movie beating us over the head with the awfulness of said relationship it is fairly subtle and we see kit kat come to the much needed realization on her own therein we see another powerful relationship that strikes close to home for me a brother sister relationship right from the beginning when tim says that kit kat is one of the most beautiful people he has ever known i loved him the development of their relationship as they both age in the film was masterfully done and a real thrill to watchabove all the relationship that drove this movie home for me was the one between tim and his dad anybody who has ever had any feelings towards their father whether it be complete love and admiration of utter hatred and disgust could feel the power of their bond the understanding looks that his father gives the humorous tidbits he adds into his talks and his general carefree way of life make him a perfectly flawed human being he is exactly what so many kids want from a dad about time captured this relationship in the most perfect way possible and i could not look awaythis movie was fantastic you will laugh you will cry you will think deeply about your life in comparison to the ones on screen i applaud the creators behind this movie keep up the good work and i will continue to appreciate the fantastic outcome,happy
you would expect this film to be a romantic film like any other but youd be wrong this film has some really good romantic aspects but that is not what its about its about family and the choicesthe plot is done very well and also teaches you a thing or two about life it takes you back to different moments in time without making you confusedi thought the acting was brilliant but i wouldnt expect anything less from bill nighy and rachel mcadams the relationship between the father and son was truly remarkable especially because they shared the same secretthe scenery and camera work where very good but the score was okayit wasnt a thrill ride but because of the chemistry and the choices the main character makes you really get sucked into the film thats why im rating it a 810,happy
richard cutis rolls out another sentimental charming and brilliantly british rom com with about time this time its boy meets girl boy can travel in time a romantic comedy with a time travel twist at has various shortcomings but is overall pleasant and reasonably well done richard curtis writes and directs the film and he shows his skill as a director as the visuals are excellent the script has other issues but much of the drama feels real and the jokes and funny without resorting to vulgarity the humours fairly original and you cant see all of the jokes coming things are repeated thanks to the involvement of time travel but it doesnt grow repetitive this is a sentimental film but not in an overly cloying way and some of the dramatic moments are genuinely emotional but in a calm unforced sort of way the acting is good all around but the standout is bill nighy as the father whos performance sparkles with both pathos and dry wit at is a touching and funny film overall but it has several problems which become more apparent in the second halfwhile the sentimentality is fine its inevitably a bit soppy the problem with at is that theres not a lot of point once the central relationship gets going theres no conflict or threat and instead the film goes into other underdeveloped subplots the film drifts from event to event without actually saying much or offering any obstacles to the characters and leaves various plot holes in its wake at has some rather problematic messages and the implication that the main character could not have had his successes or his romances without the time travel is a bit offensive a lot of the time you cant quite see where its going at certainly lacks urgency or true conflict but its well executed and enjoyable enough for that to be overlooked and all in all its another triumph for working title many will enjoy this and it might even be a tear jerking movie for some it hasnt got an awful lot of logic to it but it doesnt necessarily need it its no back to the future but it does time travel in an interesting and less formulaic way than other time travel films710,happy
i saw the previews and felt before seeing it as with so many movies i had seen the best parts many were but i have to say and yes i am a romantic this was a movie that touched me and got to my emotions and that makes me feel more alive the loss of friends and loved ones and learning what you have comes to you in this film the relationship between the father and son is priceless decisions to be made and tests to pass keep the story going and it is so wonderfully told some wont see it for its r rating thats sad in this case as life is a little r rated at times dont let that stop you from seeing it its a little street language and modest sexuality nothing over the top i have seen it a few times and will no doubt see it again and again,happy
about time is probably my favourite film i have watched it several times and i love it and watch it with the exact same amount of enthusiasm every time this film is funnyromanticbrilliant and just purely amazingthe character chemistry is of the charts and it makes for an even better film this is definitely the idea movie for you if you love wholesome loving family journeys and seeing a lovely realistic and modern evolution of a man that is just searching through this world for love and finds it in a beautiful and shy american girli would recommend that you all watch this film and if you have well you should watch it again you wont regret it,happy
this movie was releases in 2013 but somehow i never heard of this movie from any of my friends who loves western cinema until few days back i just wanted to see a random romantic drama and found out this movie on some imdb list i watched this movie and i just loved it everything was so good about this movie its not just about romance but also a family drama and the journey from a careless boy to a responsible man this movie portrait various relations in a very unique way brothersister boyfriend girlfriend friendship and my most fav fatherson relationship although the main feature of this movie is time traveling but focus was mainly on portraying the journey of each characters the lead actor of the movie was outstanding he made the character as if of his own and all the other characters whether it was lead actors father uncle mother sister wife friends was all perfect the direction the cinematography music was a but the best part was dialogues in the end i would like to say it is he movie which you would like to watch again and again over the period of time its not absolutely perfect but you wont even imagine to change anything in this movie,happy
this film touched me given so many similarities with my life not the time bit i guess that is not too surprising since i probably grew up in much the same circumstances as the author and many of the actors country education etc the twist is of course time or the ability to rewind itthe conclusion of the film is advice that i would have loved to be able to understand at a much earlier age i hope that my kids do and are not too bored when i force this film down their throatsi have to add more lines so i will say that it is a clich it is a classic english mirage  as much as amelie poulain is a mirage of real paris im not sure that that is such a bad thing if you can ignore all that glossing over of other darker things in both films they both have an optimistic message to bringi guess i accept optimism anywhere i can get it,happy
too many people wrote far more interesting reviews that i would i can only tell you i cried a river over this movie just lying by my 10month daughter watching her sleep placidly softly peacefully unaware of the outer world this movie is about us and the way we see hours minutes seconds wasted away and how little do we care about living and most of all perceiving those around us family friends even strangers theres a whole world beyond our noses going unnoticed to us just because we are too busy doing things that may not make us completely or even slightly happy not for an oscar but cares little precious jewels have to be minimal ethereal just like this movie small but significant yeah right take your tissues you will desperately and happily need them,happy
yes this is a romantic movie but if you arent found of love stories its still worth watchingit tells us about how important is to cherish the simple moments in life and how they are in most cases the most important parts of our life if we pay attention to themthe actors are very well suited for the movie and it feels that everything is just in place making every piece of it just very pleasurable to watcheven if you dont believe on that cultureimposed information that everybody needs someone to be happy you can take out all of that and just enjoy the trip,happy
i like movies i saw a lot of movies i love my dad and hes still alive this movie touched me very deeply on how i think about my own lifeso simple but so deep incredible and if you have a difficult relation with your dad i encourage you to watch it the acting is so natural and the usual life situations so well relived time traveling let you think again  and again about human relations and family problems in a so simple way that is somewhat astonishing i completely agree with one reviewer that wishes to have the ability to travel in time to watch this movie for the first time again im 57 and i strongly recommend this movie,happy
when tim lake domhnall gleeson turns 21 his father bill nighy tells him that men in his family can travel through time his sister kit kat lydia wilson brings charlotte margot robbie to stay for the summer his power is unable to make the beautiful charlotte fall for him he moves to london and stays with bitter playwright harry tom hollander he has a wonderful night with the magical mary rachel mcadams however harry had a horrible opening night for his play he goes back in time to fix it but his magical night with mary disappears he uses his power but also finds some limitationsrichard curtis creates the one of the best time traveling romcom gleeson is likable and adorkable mcadams is magically adorable she is dating down a bit but the two has good chemistry nevertheless the time traveling could have gone horribly wrong the first steps help alleviate a good deal of it my biggest fear for this movie is that tim would use his powers to keep changing history to force mary to fall for him the fact that he couldnt get charlotte helps and that mary falls for him without his powers is also very important it culminates in one of the more profound ways to use time travel,happy
i just finished watching this absolutely genius film simply delightful in the way it creates emotions and draws you into the plot although at first it seems slow the film and the characters are just teasing you into the world which it sets to unleash this film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions and allows you time and essence to absorb them and feel the feelings the film is portraying the simple plot makes life seem simple and all the woes we have so silly this film carefully constructs its meaning around societies meaning of perfection and a happy life thoroughly enjoyed and certainly laughed and shed a tear,happy
there are touches of deja vu in this film which cleverly stitches in time travel to a love story encompassing all the central characters first and foremost it is about love both romantic and familial but with a couple of characters who can play little tricks with time not all the time trips go as planned but they always provide food for thought there are the usual curtismarked laugh out loud moments the careful casting of the leads the flawed diamonds of characters that always bejewel mr curtiss scripts and the tragedies that open our eyes so very successfully through all their faults the lead characters are such believable characters and as usual for mr curtis the token american character this time rachel mcadams is perfectly castperhaps mr curtis is guilty of formula writing you may say and youd have a point but just like his use of rain and foul weather he manages to freshen it all up and keep us guessing until the end its a formula others copy but no one does it better than the director himselfand so if you want to watch a heart warming romcom does very professionally then this is up there with the bestnine out of ten as a film but ten out of ten for the lead actors  all of them,happy
this movie is a piece of art am not good at reviewing with detail put i just watched this film and it was a wonderful experience it brought me back to the good old days where they made films that picture life in a very positive way and put a lot of focus on that its all their love family kids parents relatives all of this combined in one movie and the time travel thing although its a fantasy of some sort of a way yet they have implemented this idea very genuinely life its not about money and good education nor technology its about the people around u we really miss that in this present we are living with a lot of dependency on modern technology lets us forget the people and not enjoy the true nectar of life the acting am just gonna say they all did an excellent job even the mother who we seen so little of her i loved the uncle and the father although they are side actors to the story their presence played a huge part to the beauty of that movie i especially loved the sister i have a crush on her now i mean she did a brilliant job and i was concerned most on her more that her brother in the film what a great story and a great movie a job well done i advice it to ages and specially to those kids who spent most of their time on iphone and all that pointless stuff appreciate the life you have that is pictured in this movie ,happy
a great movie actually one of the greatest movie of recent year there is fun there is romance sentiment everything the director and the actor make the movie perfect in this type of movie sometime people get confused by the story but this movie has a really logical story domhnall gleeson did a great job but bill nighy did a spectacular acting as dad lydia wilson as kit kat did a cute role the movie lovers must watch this movie it will be great miss if someone miss the movie richard curtis direction and the story surely make you happy and sad and happy if you watch this movie so dont listen the heaters and watch this movie if you wanna enjoy a nice time and lastly its a great movie to watch with someone you love a lot,happy
i adored this movie im not sure why people didnt enjoy it i found it to be richard curtiss best work so far so much heart and soul stark reality pain and love he captured how we should all be and not allow the stresses of our lives to keep us from enjoying what is truly important to us it is well acted i laughed and cried the beach scene was just a tearjerker and i rarely cry at movies the scene where he discovers that posy wouldnt have been born and the beach scene were my favorite bill nighy is wonderful in this movie rachel mcadams has such depth as an actress she can really draw you in and portrays her characters with her ability to laugh so deeply that she is just adorable how can anyone not like her plus domhall gleeson was wonderful as tim as with love actually this move was wonderfully cast i dont get too upset with far fetched movies like the lake house or like this one its a movie its an escape i dont understand why people want to write reviews how the time travel aspect doesnt make sense most movies dont make logical sense look at star wars everyone loved that movie but was it possible who cares its a movie its a two hour break from the stress in your life i adore richard curtis and i really think this movie is wonderful,happy
i wasnt sure what to expect i got the dvd from my public library and purposely avoided seeing the trailer they usually reveal too much so when tim turned 21 and his dad pulled him aside and told him the men of their family all are born with the ability to timetravel it was a complete surprise to methe timetravel has constraints you can only travel to a prior time one that you have lived and can now imagine you simply go into a darkened closet or room clinch your fists close your eyes and imagine the exact time you want to go back to later clench your fists again and go back to the presentit has some elements of groundhog day where phil learns a bit more each day about how to snare the girl of his dreams here when tim makes an awkward and unsuccessful approach all he has to do is go back a few minutes and try it overdomhnall gleeson is really good as tim who after he turns 21 goes to london to live and work as a lawyer at one point his lawyer friend comments that tim is really good when it looks like he is sure to lose a case he somehow comes up with something to win timetravel obviously although they dont dwell on itwhen in london he meets up with rachel mcadams one of my favorites as american mary living and working in london as a reader for a book publishing firm his meeting her gets a bit complicated as when he travels back to fix a different problem for a friend thus missing the actual meeting time for mary has to devise a different way to gain her friendship and eventual loveif simply described in writing the premise can sound a bit hokey but in fact is very good and presents many meaningful and humorous situations one is being able to visit dad played well by bill nighy  to recreate some moments from when tim was a child or to have some last moments with dad after he gets sick the whole story spans perhaps 8 to 10 years judging by the ages of the eventual children the overarching message in the movie is to enjoy every day and enjoy the people around you the rest is fantasy for entertainment and it works very wellit was also nice seeing lindsay duncan again playing tims mother she was ann mayle in the 1990s miniseries a year in provence which i enjoyed so much i have the dvd set,happy
a rom com with time travel or so i thought and clearly why ever would any self respecting male watch a romantic comedy with time travel thats why i did not watch this movie in the theater turns out that was a huge mistake  i missed the best movie of 2013this film has a very clear simple and truthful message what sets it apart is how its making its point  in the most elegant beautiful way possiblethe premise is simple  what if you had the ability to do anything over again and again as many times as you want until youre happy with it what would you do the movie proceeds to explore this question and it finds an unexpected entirely beautiful conclusion on the surface its an entertaining ride watching a young man grow up  if it was just that it would still be better than most romantic movies out there its funny it doesnt take itself too seriously its clever but on a secondary level it contains a deeper meaning and that makes it stand out and puts it up there with the best movies ive seenps how this can have an average of 7x is beyond me the only explanation is that maybe part of the audience just doesnt get it or isnt ready,happy
about time is a fantasycomedy where a subject we often wonder about becomes reality for its protagonist what if we could go back in time and redo our bad decisions erase every faux pas remove all our footsinmouth etc though quietly funny and entertaining the first halfhour or so meanders a bit but things pick up and the last halfhour is powerfully moving about time is seldom just laughoutloud funny however there is a quietly whimsical humor throughout good acting by domhnall gleeson as tim as well as by everyone else but the best of all comes from bill nighy as tims dad a truly memorable character the cinematography is also excellent with some fine views of the cornwall england coast great script and great soundtrack too despite the fantastic elements this is a film about real people that like many british productions moves at the speed of life therefore people who want a lot of excitement and explosive action may be a little bored with it,happy
i took a chance watching this film hoping it wouldnt be a waste of time as dramas go there are no villains and the cathartic moments are so small it might require some life experience to understand themwe follow tim domhnall gleeson who learns hes able to go back in time on his twenty first birthday from his father tim immediately informs his father hell use it to get a girlfriend which he does manage to pull off i suspect more than half the worlds men will identify with timmary rachel mcadams delivers a wonderful performance as a young woman who recognizes her insecurities but has no solution for them and perhaps those insecurities serve her well as shes met tim who jumps through a lot of hoops to connect with her those hoops being time traveleven though time travel is part of the film it does not dominate or overwhelm it its simply a plot device that allows tim to grow and learn what is truly importantfilms with a well delivered message are rare these days this one is a true gem,happy
what a great film i was no expecting such a film from the story line i was expecting another time travel film with a flimsy story line but a bit of comedy to carry it along nothing could be further from the truth a boy gets told by his dad on his 21s birthday that he can travel back in time he decided to use it to fined true love the performance from domhnall gleeson was unexpected but truthful and you cant help but relate to his character bill nighty should take all the credit for this film his portrayal of a somewhat estranged and distant father who really loves his son more than anything brought me to tears more than once i was expecting a shady story line with a typical ending but was pleasantly surprised and would recommend any one to watch this film,happy
i really liked this movie and when i saw the actress of the movie  the notebook as the main actress i said i am going to like this one i was right since the beginning of the movie till the end it grabbed my attentionthis movie as someone said is about family about love about the things you did wrong in the past and you want to travel back in time and fix them it leaves a beautiful message at the end that we are all time travelers that we have to live our day by day with all the stress it has but also looking all the beauty around in each of our days that even if you would have the chance to live each day of your life twice there is nothing like living it just onceit moved me in every way and this is the reason why movies are done for this is the reason why you go to a theater for you do not go to a theater because of the visual effects or the 3d effects you also go to be moved in some way and when a movie leaves you with that feeling of meditation or maybe going over your head over and over some of the scenes it has accomplished its goalif it leaves you talking about it for a few days it means it was worth the view,happy
expect to be in for a jolly good ride if a film is both written and directed by richard curtis four weddings and a funeral notting hill love actually add a fine cast of actors a bit of a kink with time travel of sorts and out comes this little british confection perfect for valentines day  or any day when an uplifting bit of romantic fluff is neededthe setting for the most part is cornwall and the film is narrated by 21year old tim lake domhnall gleeson who is awkward with finding a girlfriend and in general unlucky in love as played out in a rather disastrous new years eve party but things change when tims father bill nighy tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time tim cant change history but he can change what happens and has happened in his own lifeso he decides to make his world a better placeby getting a girlfriend sadly that turns out not to be as easy as you might think moving to london to train as a lawyer tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure mary rachel mcadams they fall in love and then an unfortunate timetravel incident means hes never met her at all so they meet for the first time againand againbut finally after a lot of cunning time traveling he wins her heart tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal to save his wedding from the worst bestman speeches to save his best friend playwright harry tom hollander from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter despite a nasty traffic jam outside abbey road during his life tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors but also in the lives of his relatives and friendstims family is a bit on the loony side and in addition to bill nighy as his wondrously gifted father there is lindsay duncan is his mum richard cordery is his space cadet uncle d and lydia wilson is his sister nutty but sweet sister kit kat margot robbie vanessa kirby will merrick and tom hughes offer excellent cameos the time travel idea peters out once the film has started but the idea has been planted and helps make this frothy film float were all traveling through time together every day of our lives all we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride,happy
at my local cinema there was obviously something wrong with the heating system right near the end of the movie those dastardly ducts blew something into my eyes dust or sand or something similar made my eyes well up ever so slightly thats the only logical explanation as im no sucker for maudlin moments this movie was quite the unexpected treat never played for allout laughs it still had a pleasant comedic undertone the acting was spoton bill nighy was an absolute delight as always the movie was never preachy but it still felt like i learned something from it ie the need to appreciate life it even made my beloved wife forget all about my many and various shortcomings which is no small task,happy
i dont know how to start exactly but yeah i can erase it if i dont like it thats what this movie implies for i just loved it to the bottom of my heart it was just full of routine life nothing extraordinary but love everywhere the thing i just want to say to about the director that he hit right chords about life and i really want to live like that and express myself in right way that i dont have to go back and delete it thanks for making this movie imdb allows for only 10 otherwise i would have rated 100 out of 10 the people who never seen it and thought it boring or something like that people give it a chance and let me assure you it would best 2 hours of your life and life after that would simply much more joyful,happy
ive been a member of this community for quite a bit and i have never written a review but tonight after enjoying this masterpiece i just needed to do itfor me a good movie like art its all about the feelings and my god i felt happy in love grateful sad angry nostalgic you just get so deep into the life of this character and he guides you throw all of it in such a lovely waysome people may think this is just cheesy commercial rachel mcadams kind of the time travelers wife stuff but im glad to tell you its not not that i dont love her but one has to admit for me the time travel thing wasnt even the main topic of the movie it was just a resource used to tell you how the beautiful things in life are the ones we pass by lots of times unseen it reminded me how i felt after watching le fabuleux destin damlie poulain im definitely adding this one to my wanna feel happy list and i have to say i had a great laugh too loved uncle desmondi hope this will encourage you to see the film and dont pass it by just because the looks,happy
one of those movies that makes me begin writing while it is not over yet a movie that i was told of from a very good and beautiful person a movie in contrast of all other movies coming from the big screen that can not receive low rating there should be more like it even if they are strongly idealisticthe protagonist had a poster of amelie very good one too in his room and i hope that it was his sisters room if you know what i mean and what happened with this guy he never grew old  obviously that is the meaning we have to be more what we are in our best momentsmodest at first sight this movie showed the important things in life and it reminded us that we always can be more good we have to bet on the positive and graduating in life that there are moments which we have only once in our lifetime and we should be gentle with the similar moments to them every time when they happen to notice the little things in life that we have to try to make our ordinary days extraordinary lot of commas a it is like this life is a continuing comma with a small final full stop in the endhttpvihrenmitevmoviesblogspotcom,happy
my friends often recommended me this film when this movie was screened but i couldnt go to a cinema i want to watch this movie in the cinema because this movie is really good i misunderstood that the main character of this movie is a girl but it is a boy he is muddy one dayhe is taught that men of his family can travel in time by his father he try to change his mistake returning the past alsohe can get a girlfriend and marry her of course he challenged many times the scenes are funny we can laugh at that because they seem as if ng scenes i think he is cunning but he finally notices the importance of days also i like the mood of this film because the heroine is very cute and the music is comfortable therefore this movie is my favorite one,happy
my husband and i loved this film we were both in tears at the end and found it highly relatable for different reasons i wont ruin the movie by giving a play by play but just know that it will take you through the full spectrum of emotions the casting was wonderful and i love bill nighy as the dad the movie is seriously a mustwatch for anyone that has ever found himself not appreciating the wonders in their own lives its truly beautiful in its complexity and i highly recommend the movie i love this movie and it totally grasps the human part without being weird the two leads are a fabulous wonderful couple which is a lovely thing to see nowadays since that is rare tim and his dad have a wonderful relationship that could make anyone envious,happy
richard curtis is a sign of certain quality in the british cinema even in the event of recurrent approaches scenes and topics eg laugh between tears ups and downs in romance giggling moments amidst serious scenes colourful supporting characters and last but not least  a wedding scene anyhow there is always a new angle and in spite of some disharmony and flaws in the plot about time is definitely another welldone creation with fine performances even in supporting roles particularly domhnall gleeson as tim rachel mcadams as mary bill nighy as dad tom hollander as harrythe role of scifi was not too big good for me  so the film is apparently not for genuine fantasy and fiction lovers and the amount of big laugh opportunities is lower than eg four wedding and a funeral and love actually bearing that in mind i am sure that if you have liked curtis concepts you will have a pleasant and warmhearted 2 hours in front of tv screen,happy
about time the movie about tims life after he discovers that the men in his family can travel back in time the concept of the movie is smart and interesting in my opinion and i love it i wouldve liked to give the movie 10 stars out of 10 but i gave it 9 why why would i do that when i consider this part of my top ten favourite movies well it took me several times of watching until i was able to finish it the first time i got bored i felt like nothing interesting was happening and i didnt understand why it was about that girl caroline when id seen that the movie was supposed to have rachel mcadams in it the second time i watched about half way through but didnt have the time to finish it and lastly the third time i finally finished it and cried spoiler i really liked bill nighys character and him dying made me very sad that was when i realised how good the movie was and i have now watched it many times the plots are good and the scene when after hes travelled in time and comes home and finds another child than his daughter posy is scary but interesting at the same time because he realises that he cant travel in time all the time it is a long movie and it has its boring bits but it is worth watching definitely,happy
in order for love stories to be successful in my experience they have to be pretty depressing at least a huge struggle a person has to go through and come out still in love or just survive it this is not one of those stories yet its still a great story about love and time travel without so much heartache in my opinion very well done for that to richard curtis who was writer and director i didnt think a movie like this was possible i love that you have proved me wrong in this i solute you and from now on i will follow your work closely i thought for sure after looking at the previews and seeing rachel mcadams this was going to be a depressing and yet mesmerizing love storylike all the others if youre like me looking for a movie thats just good from beginning to end where you learn lessons about love and loss without completely making every mistake the first time instead just learning how to go through them the right way this movie is the movie for you 9 out of tenjust because i save the 10s i guess for movies that i think will be remembered throughout time even though this movie is extremely well done its another story about love loss and time travel it doesnt stand out as much to other people as it did to me i guess so 1 for that because everyone else doesnt realize there isnt another love story this well done without making you completely heartbroken first this movie holds is own with all of them without putting you through that so just enjoy a good movie,happy
the story really makes good use of its long twohour duration and actually teaches something about the thing which until now seems to be impossible time travel the two acts that the movie is divided into actually tell two different kind of focus where at the first act tim is actually hard at accepting things and always does his best to rewind time and mend things even to the tiniest bit of detail but on the second act the thing with his father teaches tim to let go of his control and accept life as is and enjoy it this movie doesnt concern with all those complex and complicated physics or philosophy surrounding time travel thus making the movie feels as the lightest among all other time travel movies what makes me like this movie even more is the tiniest bit of biblical reference tims dad said to tim this makes him a great and exemplary character for not following the footsteps of his male bloodlines that fell to the traps of money and other worldly obsessions the acting overall feels good especially as the movie makes its way onto the second act where we see bill nighys acting really supports domnhall gleeson in making the screenplay to feel more alive rachel mcadams adds nicely to the movie but i think bill nighys acting really steals the spotlight at the second act,happy
this movie or i should say a happy feeling will leave you gleeful and joyous at the end i wished this movie to never and just keep on going and make us feel more humane and more lovable it has been by far the most touching story written by richard curtis and he has portrayed love onscreen with a very different new and mesmerizing prospective rachel mcadams was once again perfectly suited for the role and played her part with perfection and heart but domhnall gleeson makes you live all sorts of emotions the story is very different from other stories and the fantasy in it made it more wonderful to watch it a different sort of drama well i would say that love is eternal and has different forms through which you can deluge to the ones you love a wonderful movie to watch in the winters,happy
i got so intrigued about the time traveling and about it being funny that made say hey maybe i should watch it and not to mention that my fave actress rachel mcadams starred in this at first the movie was fun i loved the way how it put humor into the very unorthodox family of tim for me this was something new in the timetravelling series wherein its in his genes as the story progressed i felt myself being drawn into it i love how there would be scenes where it made you celebrate being a human the quirks of the characters and whatnot but towards the end my tears just flowed nonstopthis is a film that said that sure time traveling is fun but you cant change whats written if its your time its your time it was so bittersweet when tim and his dad met for the last time even more so when he decided to have another child it made me realize that though you want to cling so badly to the past you cant because you have to live not only for yourself but for others too i could truly say that this movie touched me time is limited you have to spend it with the people you love doing crazy things,happy
this film is completely underrated i joined imdb to rate this movie because i think the message is so powerful my mom had highly recommended this movie months ago and i only watched it because she was speaking so highly of it as soon as i heard the word time travel i had no interest in seeing the film but trusting her i watched it anyway as other reviewers have mentioned the common clichs of time travel movies are skipped over i wish i had known this because i could have enjoyed the film even more instead of waiting to hate the movie and waiting to confirm that i hate all time travel movies this movie brought me to sobbing tears in the best way possible it leaves me thinking about my own life and crying now as i think back to some of the more powerful scenes in the movie there are flaws in the time travel that made me feel a bit uneasy so be warned that if you like a flawless movie with a story that doesnt overlook a single detail you may be slightly frustrated i wont reduce my rating though because i loved the movie so much,happy
when i saw the trailer i just thought that this might be another lovely cute and sweet love film and it might not be bad to watch my thought was right for the first half of the film where tim try to find himself a girlfriend with some interesting yet boring humors and when kit kat had accident i thought oh no its gonna be really boring if he coming all back to help his sister and begin all again with mary but no what happened next was totally out of what i had imagined before things turned out with so many meaning not just a love film anymore i really love the message of the film live your days as it is your last day and you can come back all the time and i really love the life style of the characters especially tims familys i love their house love their decoration style and all of that i love their characters love this film so much ps english is not my first language and im not very good at it so please forgive me if you feel uncomfortable when you found some grammar mistakes in my review,happy
about time is a nice surprise for the first minutes i thought i was watching another sappy mushy wushy romance movie but this movie is more than that its a movie about family the relationship about father bill nighy is exceptional as always and son the last scene is particularly touching but i wont go into that ill let the viewer decidethe soundtrack is excellent and it goes well with the moviei give this an 8510 only because i think the chemistry between domhnall gleeson and rachel macadams is not the best but you quickly let that go as soon as the story develops,happy
were all traveling through time together every day of our lives all we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable rideif there is someone who can get away with being too schmaltzy generic charming and sentimental its richard curtis it comes as no surprise here considering hes directed love actually and wrote such romcoms as four weddings and a funeral bridget joness diary and notting hill among others he has a tendency of melting even the toughest hearts and no matter how prepared you think you are for his next film somehow he gets you again perhaps about time is his most sentimental film and that could turn some people off but i must say this isnt your typical romantic comedy half way through the film it turns into a completely different movie becoming one about family dynamics and enjoying the ordinary moments in life perhaps the reason why curtis gets away with being so charming is that he creates a perfect balance in his stories and introduces comedic relief at the right moments about time is a flawed film but you can probably say this about all his films the thing a lot of people might have a problem with specifically in this one is the time traveling element which many may find a bit absurd but it worked for me at least it was much better than the other time traveling movie that rachel mcadams starred in and i think curtis uses this element as a sort of parable to remind us of the importance of savoring each day it may feel like a sermon at times but its one i dont mind being reminded of carpe diemtim domhnall gleeson who you may recognize as bill weasley in the last two harry potter films is a shy kid living with his parents bill nighy and lindsay duncan and lovable sister kit kat lydia wilson the morning of his 21st birthday his father shares with him a family secret the men in their family can travel in time but they can only do so to moments they personally have experienced tim decides to use this special ability to find love because he really needs all the help he can get for it tim leaves his parents beautiful beachside estate in cornwall for london in order to become a lawyer he moves in with one of his fathers friends harry tom hollander whos a struggling writer with a bad temper in london tim meets mary rachel mcadams and the two fall for each other but due to a time traveling incident that night is erased from marys memory and tim has to find another way to win her backi feared this film would become another sort of 50 first dates but surprisingly it took an unexpected turn halfway through the film and becomes something else it is not just a romantic comedy it becomes a movie about family love and life where tim learns a couple of valuable lessons along the way mcadams and gleeson shared great chemistry on screen but the true standouts in this film were the supporting characters especially tims father played by the wonderful bill nighy he is great here once again while wilson duncan and hollander all are extremely funny and used for comedic relief its a relief from the schmaltzy sentimentality of the film its as if curtis is admitting hes manipulated us way too much with all the emotional sentimentality and now its time for a good laugh if you dont find this film funny then you will probably find it way over the top with the sentimentality its not a film for everyone but i had a good time and was charmed by the story,happy
this film failed it seriously its below mediocre were it shorter id think it would be a pilot episode of a sitcom that didnt make it the timetravel is a gimmick that is explored ad nauseam also it is more paradoxal than the average scifi time travel to the point one just gives up trying to understand the timeline logic at a given time in the film the rules of time travel posed by tims father were broken several times and at a given time it even seems to have a cancel button making tim potentially an immortal lord of life and death that always acts as silly as a teenager i though the movie would end and the credits would roll several times whenever that happens in a romcom you can bet the it fails at something even if you happen to like the individual situations these seem to have been glued together as the movie just seems to be lingering about tim love and life it could go on and on until either tim dies of old age or the audience of boredom or it could be a sitcom the jokes are not funny its awkward tim himself is awkward and time travel gives him the chances not to be awkward with this unbreakable timetravel rule he transfers his awkwardness to the movie as he travels by the end of the movie tim has erased his own awkwardness by transferring it to the plot,happy
just awful i enjoyed the time travelers wife and this was like that except lacking everything that made that movie interesting with hardly any significant interesting time travel and a boring pathetic loser for a main character who never grows at all throughout the moviethe film doesnt make you care at all about any of the characters in fact because it never really tries to the only tear jerking that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the filmit drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because again none was ever developedthe reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy it did not deliver whatsoever i cant see anyone with taste enjoying this filmrated 2 because the first 20 minutes were somewhat interesting,happy
in one sentence the most dull and boring movie i have seen in a long time made for simple minds among the various time line mistakes father playing ping pong saying he never won before but when he was younger he won several times etc there are story reasonsreasons 1 the main character picks up a girl with his power using time traveling instead of money or any other more realistic approach  he doesnt even use his smartness 2 he marries the girl and thats the end of his character development  does he ever get smarter no  he still runs through a trial and error process to fix his sisters life just as he did the entire movie before 3 the characters are extremely flat and dull fe his uncle is characterized as having no memory and that stays throughout the entire movie his mother has no development at all when the father dies sheher emotions are not portrayed at all his girlfriend and later wife does not undergo any development either 4 the movie shows a person that wants to have a perfect life and that uses his special power to alter every experience that he makes that is not according to his ideal bad movie avoid if you dont want to get bored in socalled perfection through homogeneity,happy
i didnt really know what to expect besides just a romance comedy and i thought the time travel thing might make the film too cheesy or fake but nope i think its a pretty insightful film and very funny its very well done it feels different than other movies out there especially other romantic comedies also i like how the main guy has such good charisma and rachel mcadams is great as always i think its a movie that leaves you feeling very happy and feeling happy for the characters the main thing i took away from this movie is that you should try to live each day trying to appreciate the small good things even when stress or ordeals may upset you yes this sounds very generic but it really does put perspective on how you should look at life if you look at each day joyfully and appreciating the small moments youll have better days,happy
sometimes you can tell a nice story and you dont have to get so bogged down with the heave drama but still draw a tear or two and that is what the writers have done here a sweet romantic movie with lots of fun laughs and twists to keep you paying attention the time travel is handled very well and you can easily see it as really happening or just being something that helps this family cope with loss by remembering things differently however it is a very enjoyable movie that will lift your spirits and you may even want to watch it again to enjoy the finer details i recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedies or a little bit of fantasy its no mimzy but rather quite the whimsy give it a try you wont be disappointed,happy
on his 21st birthday tims dad lets him in on a secret  the male members of his family can travel back in time tim uses this ability over the years to try to undo bad things sometimes making things worse in the processrichard curtis writes and directs a romantic comedy which hangs from a scifi hook although to call it a scifi movie or even a time travel movie would be grossly overstating the case it is charming constantly funny though not necessarily bellylaugh funny always interesting it doesnt always go in the direction you expect although it does mostly and it is populated by characters who you are happy to spend time withtim is played by domhnall gleeson as a nerd who arcs gracefully into a good but ordinary except for his ability man rachel mcadams who i dont normally like does well as love interest mary bill nighy steals the film as usual and the rest of the support are all very good tom hollanders acidic harry is particularly good funthe story is solid but not exceptional either as a romance slice of life or time travel the script is as one might expect from curtis frothy but with some meat on the bones with real emotion and hearti liked this a lot,happy
im very surprised to read so many good reviews about this movie which just reminds me of the beauty of difference of opinion nevertheless i found this movie absolutely boring really very boring indeed its just a story of an not interesting every day life with a supposedly deep meaning im sorry but the dead poet society delivered that same message way better for me i had no trouble staying awake during that onei dont remember in recent times ever been so aware of the time passing because the movie just kept on dragging and dragging it felt like a 5 hour movie with nothing memorable rachel mcadams is so underused but then again the story is rather bland i see that many people enjoyed the dialogs i did not find them charming witty or interesting i really thought i was going to see a comedy and what i got was a total waste of time,happy
i liked the concept a man travels through time to make a girl fall in love with him unfortunately right at the very beginning after charlotte turns him down he admits that all the time travel in the world couldnt make someone fall in love this kind of made the concept defunctfrom then onwards were treated to entirely predictable events as the dull humour quickly drops out of the film and it makes a stab at being something serious failing to realise that most of the intelligent male audience dragged into it by women likely lost interest a long time agowhat is probably most infuriating though is the writers inability to create any leading male who isnt a public schoolboy woody allen clone and if a viewer closed his or her eyes the lead was hugh grant right down to the exact amount of air sucked in during pauses of verbose retortsbefore the end i had to apologise for being unable to sit through this painful mess of a film and went to another room to do something more worthwhile and can only recommend that others skip ahead to that stage rather than pressing play on this disc at all,happy
when my hubby said the movie was a bit scifi and probably not my type i was a bit hesitant about attending the preview we went along with my sisters and some female friends i really enjoyed the movie and was chuckling away to myself the gags were good the movie pace kept me entertained domhnall and rachel were very good and billy nighy and lindsay duncan had some quite funny lines the main characters were all pretty good it makes you think about life and if you could go back and change some things in your life like tim has done and the resulting consequencessix out of seven of us really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it i reckon it will be one that will be added to our home collection when it is out on dvd,happy
one of the things that strikes me about this film is how ruined i am by clich plots of most movies that set up a nice situation just so they can ruin it and make plot about it during first two thirds of the movie i was constantly expecting the main character to do something stupid or just unfortunate and that everything nice that was fall apart the more i waited the more terrified i was expecting all plot insofar to be a buildup for that one fatal blunder then it slowly downed on me that it wasnt going to happen  he was just a normal nice guy with maybe more common sense that most and he did smart but otherwise normal decent human things and it worked for him perfectly in the end everything was perfect and ordinary at the same time just perfectly ordinary just perfect its the best film i ever watched for me,happy
richard curtis has been responsible  as a writer director or both at once  for such beloved romantic comedies as four weddings and a funeral notting hill and love actually it would seem to make perfect sense then for his newest film to be marketed in the same way about time the new richard curtis romcom featuring time travel never judge a film by its trailer or poster though as the saying goes because theres an almost startling heartbreaking depth to about time which slowly reveals itself to be a story about family and love thats only concerned in part with romanceon his 21st birthday awkward gangly tim domhnall gleeson is told by his dad bill nighy that the men in his family have a unique ability to travel in time they cant kill hitler or take a tour of renaissance europe but by going into a dark space and clenching their fists they can revisit moments in their own personal timelines when tim meets the sweet beautiful mary rachel mcadams he resolves to do everything in his power  including go back in time  to win her heartthat may sound like a bit of a kooky premise but curtis execution of it  in his dual capacities as writer and director  is completely winning in the moments when its very much a romcom about time is deliciously romantic and sweetly hilarious theres an effervescent joy to tim meeting mary for the first time again just as the ways in which they fall  and stay  in love are close to magical curtis films have always used music to great effect and here he peppers the love story with songs that will move into your heart and stay there like ben folds the luckiest and the waterboys how long will i love youbut about time isnt just about a boy and a girl finding each other its also about what happens after that when romance leads to a lifetime spent together making memories and becoming a family tim discovers to his horror that his gift cannot shield him from all the low points in life when he starts having more to lose the costs of doubling back on his own timeline grow ever larger its a point made very effectively when tim tries to save his beautifully quirky sister kitkat lydia wilson from the heartbreak and horror that has derailed her lifein many ways this is curtis most personal film it folds in life lessons and insights about death loss family and treasuring whats extraordinary in even the most ordinary of lives he seems to suggest that tims gift is more of a choice it can be used in the flashiest of ways unravelling lives and histories in the clench of a fist or it can be used to savour all the little things that we take for granted all the moments that slip by in the rush and bustle of a busy day tims romance with mary might be the selling point of the film but its really his tender emotional relationship with his dad that will stay with audience members long after the credits rollif theres anything that doesnt quite work its curtis deceptively simple notion of time travel tims gift is more plot device than plot point but it still raises more than a few questions along the way does tim have to relive his entire life whenever he goes back in time why are only the men of the family given this odd marvellous gift isnt there something faintly worrying about men who can completely control the shape and nature of their relationships with the ladies in their lives about time breezes swiftly past these concerns but they lurk disquietingly within the film anywaycurtis cast is an unmitigated marvel gleeson is a sweetheart his bumbling warmth adding greatly to tims gentle appeal mcadams shines brightly in a slightly undercooked role leaving no room for doubt that men would brave the vagaries of time travel for a chance to see her smile its fortunate that her second foray into timecrossed romance is so much more successful than the lamentable the time travellers wife nighy meanwhile all long limbs and rumpled charm is heartbreakingly lovely as tims dad the father who patiently teaches his son about everything that matters in life and lovea few months ago curtis announced his plans to retire as a director after about time  this would allow him he said to take properly to heart the films message about consciously choosing to enjoy ones life in all its quiet splendour for fans of curtis its not a complete loss as he plans to focus on writing and producing and has in any case directed only three films in his career but on the strengths of the sweetly devastating unexpectedly accomplished about time its hard not to feel at least a small sense of loss in imagining what might otherwise have been,happy
when i went into this movie all i knew was that it has rachel mcadams brendan gleesons son who i knew from harry potter and six shooter and time travel as im usually not the greatest scifi fan my expectations werent too high i guess when i left the theater 120 minutes later i was wowed by what i just witnessed i really liked the way they split this film basically into two halves the first is mostly romantic comedy the main premise is initially rather odd as the lead character finds out from his dad that he has the ability to travel in time and so he does for a while to correct certain mishaps that happened to him mostly loverelated ones and here and there also a favor to a friend i wont go into detail what he decided to relive particularly but it was all quite entertaining and never really dragged how he needs to run away to make it happen was always one of my favorite parts mcadams is always nice to watch and she gives a solid performance here too i read zooey deschanel was also an option for the part and i dont really like her so im actually glad they went with mcadams who has unusual dark hair here there is also one particularly sweet sequence when he finally has a chance to get with the woman of his dreams and realizes shes not the one he wants but mcadams character is up to halfway into the film id maybe rate it a 710the second half however is where the film really delivers the two are an item at this point so theres more dramatic focus now first on how their baby has changed a very moving scene especially when he sees the right one shortly afterward again through time travel and then for quite a while on the relationship between the central character and his dad excellently portrayed by bill nighy also more scenes on the main characters sisters crumbling life get included and how time travel cant solve these issues for her admittedly these come short qualitywise compared to nighys but only because nighy nails his role so much the relationship between him and his son is just so wonderful to watch the tabletennis with letting the other win the walk at the beach and the final meeting which is inevitably the last as gleesons character is about to become a dad once more eyewetting stuff and i cried quite a bit for the last 45 minutesas i wrote earlier im really not that big of the scifi genre in general but it always seems to deliver for me when its just a sidestory to the exploration of interpersonal relationships just like here or in never let me go another film i totally adore about time is a feelgood movie with serious undertone and some truly emotional highs also it teaches us to live every day in a way we would not want to relive it even if we had the chance because it was just so wonderful the first time and we paid attention to all the beautiful details and made the most of it and wouldnt want to lose that day as we could hardly relive it in an equally great manner again because we made every minute count the director richard curtis is also responsible for the beloved mr bean and love actually and im okay with both but neither impressed me as much as this one here to me its his masterpiece and finest worktodate its a perfect example of how a smart story with lots of heart is more important than challenging characters or supergreat performances who couldnt even save the worst script it is my secondfavorite film of 2013 right now behind sein letztes rennen and i very much recommend it and hope youll have an equally great time watching this gem of a movie thank you for reading my review i hope you enjoyed it and dont want to go into the nearest closet to go 10 minutes back in time and unread it,happy
richard curtis writer of successful comedy shows and films like blackadder the vicar of dibley four weddings and a funeral and notting hill debuted as director with the alright love actually and

to travel back in time to win the girl and connect with his father mcadams is really beautiful and sweet as the girl the lead male marries and has children with and nighy is lovable as the bumbling but always reliable father supporting cast members get their good moments as well the story is both clever in the way it makes you laugh feel affection and cry and it is clever because it points everything in life we may take for granted it is a sweet love story it is a heartwarming father and son story it is funny in the right places and it is of course written and performed very well it is a great romantic comedy sciencefiction film very good,happy
richard curtis does it again delivering yet another quirky story of love life and the travails of family past and presentthe time travellers wife also starring rachel mcadams also attempted a love story dealing with the effects of the hubby disappearing every once in a while however the plot here in about time is much more delicatewe dont have any grand notions of cause and effect they just happen and you need to let it slide without too much over thinking all performances are spot on the money nighy is sublime as the steady loving father gleeson delivers an understated performance of note off center loving yet strong enough not to be sickly mcadams is used to this role beautiful down to earth funny and caring she once again deliversi agree with the previous review a little too long but its a minor blip and wont stop you wanting to clench your fists and go back 2 hours to do it all over again,happy
when he turns 21 young tim has the talk with his father  although in the case of his family the fatherson talk is actually to reveal that all the men in the family can travel in time back to any moment in their own life told of the downsides of just chasing money or just never working tim continues his life but determined to make the most of his talent to try and make sure he has true love it doesnt work out great at first but a chance meeting with mary starts a journey of a lifetimethere is a message at the end of this film that is essentially about living life as it comes and enjoying it for what it is  not necessarily everyone quitting to go and travel for the rest of their life someone needs to work but just enjoying the ride whatever that ride is it is a commendable message but the irony of it is that it is being delivered to someone who has just not done that for the previous 2 hours of course going into the film i knew that this is a richard curtis romcom filled with the usual faces and of course doing the usual things so there is an element of buyer beware but i was curious about the timetravel angletruth is that outside of some plot points and basically the same jokes done over and over again it really doesnt add much to what is essentially a film so sugary it will give you diabetes the shame of it is that it does have nice ideas and themes in here but it never misses a chance to overdo it so the soundtrack is full of easy coldplayesque rubbish the narrator explains it all slowly so that the film doesnt need to be work the relationships are all soft and cuddly the characters are all totally fantasy people who only exist in curtis films and generally the whole thing is overdone and hugely sentimental i would lie if i said that it didnt still work as such but it really was hard work to stay close to it considering how much it pushed me awaythe cast match the tone of the film and i found gleeson and mcadams to be overly cutesy and cuddly  not a rough edge on either of their characters or their performances nighy at least adds a bit of clout to the mostly empty emotion while hollander grant griffiths and a few others at least add a bit of grit or cleverness into the film mostly though the whole thing is so safe and smoothed that almost no character remains in it of course it is not awful  it is too professionally crafted for that but what it is just didnt work for me about time taught me a lesson about time  that it shouldnt be used for films that i dont fancy much but might watch just because someone said it is alright,happy
good concept the acting is fine but there are some issuesfor one both leads are miscast the male lead here needs to be charming or funny and while he seems like a fine actor hes not that charming or that funny i also dont understand why they felt like rachel mcadams was a good casting choice theres not enough background information about her character and to put it mildly there is absolutely no chemistry between the two leads in the filmthe film reminded me of mr nobody  only it wasnt nearly as goodi like the point of the film  which is that its actually better to appreciate the lessthanperfect moments of your life have no regrets but just takes so long to get to this its spoonfed to the audience in the last 5 minutes like the film did a bad job of expressing it and it did i also didnt care for some of the rules of time travel which seemed like they were written on the flyi went in with high expectations but thats not the only reason that this fell flat 78 this was no better than the slightly aboveaverage delivery man that i also watched last nightthe bottomline is that i just didnt find anything interesting about these characters  other than the eversoobvious ability to travel in time id probably skip it63100,happy
heres an indepth summary of the moviemain character uses time travel to get a girlfriend then we spend the rest of the movie watching his boring life play out there i just saved you 2 hoursthe acting is bad the characters are flat the comedy isnt funny and the story if you can call it that is a boring waste of time based on its current imdb score 78 i would say this is the most overrated movie of all timeanyone interested in a good time travel movie as i was dont even bother,happy
i have to admit i enjoyed this one yes they do make certain rules about time travel and then immediately break them but thats not what the story is about and yes it is about well off white people but again if i wanted a film that was politically correct and socially aware i dont think id have richard curtis write it no this was pure escapism for me and i happily went along for the ride great performances all round but the standout for me was bill nighy he really nailed the part of the dad for me i have to say i liked the soundtrack as well with many contemporary tunes littered along the way so it made me laugh and i even shed a tear towards the end and theres not many films can do that i admit im a bit of a sucker for the occasional romcom and this one had just the right ingredients for mesteelmonsters verdict recommendedmy score 8210you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog thoughts of a steelmonster,happy
i was not sure how good this movie would be based on the preview so i went in not expecting much it starts off with a young man who obviously has lady issues and doesnt quite seem to know how to deal with women after his father told him he had the ability to travel through time it really got me interested after his unfortunate happenings with charlotte it seems he was out of luck to find a woman he than moves to the city and meets mary rachel mcadams and immediately falls for her some things happens and he ends up going back in time to help his friend out not knowing his date with mary would never happen the movie really grabs you by seeing all the work he puts in for this girl and its not your basic love story as it might seem its funny and serious at the same time with an ending that will leave you in tears overall great movie im going to watch it again right now ,happy
i am that girl  the one who has a tough time suspending disbelief and just watching for the sheer enjoyment my brain automatically goes uh what that couldnt possibly happen and then it comes up with 100 reasons why the movie is not feasiblethis time was no different what was different was i just didnt care spoiler at the end when tim goes back with his dad it really should have done his children in because the theory was that you couldnt go back to a time before your children were born because then it could mess up the whole deal he would have had to walk talk speak exactly the same way they had originally done which would be impossible spoiler over but by the end i just didnt care anymore if the theory was sound i loved those characters so muchi loved their relationshipstheir quirks flaws  strengths i just loved everything about them so i didnt care if it made sense without even meaning to and for the first time in a very long time a film made me suspend my disbelief and just watch admiringly for that it deserves 10s,happy
about time is a fantastic movie it is a combination of drama romance and comedy that is not cheesy at all i could tell that this is going to be a nice movie after i saw the trailer but instead of being just a mediocre nice movie it turned out to be one of the best ive seen in months probably even years i decided to see about time merely for entertainment i didnt expect it to be anything other than another cheesy but fun to watch love story this movie will keep you sitting in your seat smiling and guessing you think you know whats going to happen next but you actually dont i enjoyed the plot narration characters settings basically every little thing about this movie the story line is just flawless i cant think of any way to make it better the characters have this amazing chemistry between each other what i love most about this movie is that it can somehow turn a fictional story into a story people could actually relate to and learn from i laughed during the first half cried during the second half it was a pleasant movie experience this movie taught me a lot about life in only two hours i strongly advice everyone to go see this movie its a winner oh and go see this movie for a date,happy
how good is richard curtis in my book he is pure genius he inspires me to be a better personhis first masterpiece four weddings and a funeral is a rollercoaster ride of comedy and tragedy packed with outlandish characters and witty lines but most of all fun his second masterpiece love actually is another magical rollercoaster but with more emphasis on the theme than on the humour about time continues this progression and it is not a comedy at all but a wonderful positive drama about humanity family and love in particular the love between a father and a sonthis is a thoroughly beautiful and intensely moving film i cried my eyes out throughout the last ten minutes i think it moved me so much partly because tim the lead character faces many of the same life experiences and choices as i have and learns lessons with which i can identify the film is firmly grounded in reality not fantasy and how refreshing is that and the plot is totally original you cant guess whats about to happendomhnall gleeson is perfect in the leading role and bill nighy is just so wonderfully honest in his role of dad the film belongs to these two my only gripe is that margot robbie had such a small part  she is a damn firecracker,happy
sometimes a flawed and somewhat predictable movie can be enjoyed by the watcher due to its charm and inoffensive manner richard curtiss time traveling love story about time is one of those films a film that provides enough laughs and heartfelt moments that only scrooge himself could not find enjoyment in this talebrendan gleesons very own domhnall gleeson gets his first big leading role here as our lovable ginger time traveling lawyer tim and he does a fine job at being a lovable red haired version of hugh grant gleesons chemistry with season romcom veteran rachel mcadams is made believable also with her slightly underused talents coming to the fore in most of their scenes and the eventual on screen romance plays out in a believable manner despite all the time traveling business occurring throughout while this love story is a major part of about time curtis has also positioned the film to be more than a man meets girl tale with a twist and with this choice has made a film all the better for itplaying tims dad is veteran british actor bill nighy who with gleeson gives the film another side that usual romcoms would be hard pressed to have its within this relationship between time traveling father and son that the movie finds many relatable and confronting issues to deal with and by films end the audiences emotional investment has been well and truly earned thanks to it in concerns to curtis as a director its also a departure for the man who has not shown this side of himself as a director before but thats not to say the film lacks a few wellearned laughs and curtis usual array of colorful supporting characters which is evidenced in tom hollanders playwright harrycoming in at roughly 2 hours about time covers a lot of ground and in doing so it would be fair to say that the films first half pales in comparison to its much more concise and impactful second half but as a whole it all comes together in such a way that its hard to fully criticize watched with the right mindset about time is the perfect movie for a night in and stepping stone for lead gleeson to find his feet in the world of big budget tent pole movies3 and a half clenched fists out of 5,happy
look i have watched a lot of good movies which pretty much all of them ended with a disappointed moment you didnt expect jack nicholson to get lobotomized in one flew or you didnt hope matt damon would be dead in elysium or you didnt wish lord of the rings would have to end like thati put nosomuch expectation to this movie when i started watching i mean really this is one kind of movie that at the beginning you understand it will be teaching you about the value of gratitude while showing the main actors getting hisher life messed up with his story talking about clicks and time travelers wife but hell yeah this movie is noti can say i was smiling a lot for every scene of this movie and it kept going until the end i was deeplytouched by the moment when tim trying so hard to have the perfect closure to get into mary i was smiling to see a lot of family moments which tim shared with his dad mom sisters even with his daughters and son and finally i was so relieved by how tim and his family dealt with his fathers death it was so wise yet meaningful in a different way that will get you at least me feeling life can be really wonderfulyes somehow this movie may be unrealistic one but hell hollywood should get their head back on to make this kind of movie it really is a good entertainment,happy
for a movie to be memorable to me it has to do one thing and one thing only it has to make me talk to myself this movie is not the most original thing ever done and a lot of what happens is a big slap in the face to cause and effect despite this i loved it i identified with the main character and the story unlike many i watch nowadays didnt seem rushed it took its time and as a result felt emotionally impactfuli think i made up a word there a lot of this is due to the excellent score but i think more is due to the excellent writing awkward conversations actually felt awkward and fatherly advice came out fatherly the entire cast was amazing but bill nighy in particular has never been more likable will this movie be for everyone of course not did it make me debate character choices out loud with myself yes yes it did,happy
the initial 130 hrs was a pretty solid romantic comedy with a tinge of fantasy if the movie had aimed for nothing more it would still have been a decent addition to curtis filmography a solid 65710 but it is the last half an hour when the movie does indeed follow a different tread than typical romcoms and at least for me personally succeeded spectacularly may be i am projecting my own emotions on those scenes which beautifully depict a fatherson relationship for them to have the effect but i do not consider that to be a flaw rather it takes the sublime touch of a great artist to get people to do that without the attempt seeming too on the nose or sappyi think curtis proves that he is one of those rare few who can achieve it,happy
the problem with about time is that it is not particularly a bad film but at the same time it is not really a good one either the film is purely and simply mediocre the premise of the film sounded interesting enough with its blend of romancecomedy and even a little bit of science fiction if you really want to call it that but i just felt that the film went nowhere with this material in the right hands a story idea like this could have really been something wonderful if it was in the hands of say charlie kaufman or someone like that but here the material loses steam and interest fast and i didnt feel the film used this interesting premise in any interesting ways events happen in the film where there is some sort of mishap or embarrassment and so henceforth we go to the science fiction aspect of the film and changing the outcomes of many situations but the problem is that the film used this plot device and gimmick too many times and it just never went anywhere and after awhile it never really seemed fresh or original but instead a film that has just one too many clichs and plot holes and it really did not feel like anything new or breakthrough but instead just a rehash of films that i have seen so many times before i appreciated that writerdirector richard curtis tried to make us connect with these characters on the screen and giving us moments of which to laugh and cry but again none of it really registered or connected with me personally i might have had a few laughs during the course of the film and at times it did hold my interest but i just overall was not all that interested in how this film would end or what would happen to these characters and the plot devicegimmick that was introduced into the story at times the film almost felt a little emotionless as well things just seemed to drag on and it was never really all that interesting and at times i do admit some of the emotion or things going on did feel a bit forced and the true emotional build up or allowing us to care or connect with these characters was never there i have seen other richard curtis films before which i have liked which was one of the reasons i chose to see about time but this i feel is one of his most underdeveloped films from a writing perspective because of how we never can connect to any one person or event and just that none of it is all that interesting i was hoping that like charlie kaufman and michel gondrys wonderful eternal sunshine of the spotless mind which did have a unique and original plot device and gimmick but that film made us care and relate to the characters and situations more so than most films i have seen and was a film that always was fascinating and kept your interest and because of how personal and realistic it got you could both identify with it and laugh and cry with it at the same time the plot device there was not underused but used in the right way and it ended up being one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best films around period i was hoping that writerdirector richard curtis would have taken the same route with about time but unfortunately the end result was too flat this isnt also to say that i hated about time because i didnt there were times where i appreciated some of the humour in it and when the emotional content did not feel too forced i felt that i did connect with it in some ways but unfortunately those moments were too few and far between i didnt like the film and i didnt hate it i think that it is going to be one of those films which i will probably remember for a couple days and then as time goes by i will forget most of what i saw on screen because it did not resonate or connect with me as i wished it would have i still like richard curtis and i would recommend viewers a lot of his other films whether written or directed by him like love actually notting hill bridget joness diary or my personal favourite the made for television movie the girl in the caf all worth checking out i wish he would have repeated some of the successful material in those films for about time but as it stands about time is neither good or bad but simply mediocre and nothing more,happy
normally id be quite hesitant to seeing a romcom but as any open minded individual the concept and charm granted the film potential based on the promotions and instantly intrigued me about time revolves around a socially awkward character tim who discovers an incredibly useful and allthemore manipulative secret that runs on the male side of his family a father essentially entrusts his son with this valuable power that allows him to travel back into his past which means the next time tim ruins a relationship or mistakenly goes for a kiss only to be humiliated thereafter its right to the nearest closet or compact room to fix the issue and reverse his horrible decisions moreover the film happened to surprise me in that it carried much more heart and depth than your standard romantic comedy and it rather flourishes in its style of authenticity progressively were either met with extremely relatable or wholly plausible situations that induce laughter or provoke various emotions deep inside that tough personality of yours speaking from a males perspective its strongly apparent sense of genuineness emphasizes the likability of the characters with bill nighy being a clear favorite retaining that charisma and lovability that all have already come to associate him with domhnall gleeson undeniably delivers a terrific performance suffused by numerous subtle facial expressions gestures and stuttered speech that effectively composes his insecure nature furthermore even though the final message of the film could be deemed cheesy its totally executed in a convincing manner in part by again its sincere essence by the time the feature has wrapped up the audience will be in tears during its development theyll be infatuated by its subject matter in such fashion about time is remarkably capable of taking you on a wavy journey that consists of sadness at times and pure excitement or comedy in others a wide variety of people will be sighted throughout its span some veritably abhorrent and others utterly sympathetic and its this distinctiveness that comprises a realistic picture something thats absolutely necessitated in a movie that deals with the kind of themes prevalent here with that being said the flicks length certainly becomes problematic as it nears the conclusion its last thirty minutes or so noticeably drag out and we encounter an unexpected scene after another just when we believe that were witnessing the last point for its thematic material we shift to a fresh setting and an additional quandary actually it reminds me of return of the kings last act which seems to present us with multiple extra scenes following several lengthy black screens when the picture eventually finishes at the mark it sought to it feels as if the whole matter couldve been wrapped up in a more concise method without dozens of further complications as a means of elucidation in sum the idea of time travel is adeptly utilized in addition to the countless laughs to be had and the highly entertaining plot overall about time is undoubtedly one of the best romcoms in recent years and i hope to see more of this kind from hollywood instead of the artificial halfassed stories infested with detestable and debauched characters they produce nowadays,happy
the picture is definitely a feelgood picture one of those which make you think i really needed it the idea of travelling in time is not that original and could therefore be dangerous to use it for the umpteenth time on the contrary the strong feelings of sweetness and tenderness which pervade it make it pleasant to see and enjoy never sounding trite or boring the cast is great and help create the feelgood atmosphere which never abandons the viewer also when some dramatic moments are to be faced since always supported by a positive feeling towards life and familiar bonds there are some new faces together with some older faces of british cinema working together very empathetically  on the background of a breathtaking cornwall which is by itself worth the ticket,happy
have you ever looked back on your life and thought what could i have done differently have you ever wished you could relive a wonderful moment over and over again well young tim lake has the ability to travel back in time same as his father and his grandfather tim is not exactly the handsomest of men he is an awkward shy and slightly introverted character yet with these new found abilities he tries to make life better for himself and those he care about by altering little events in his past this brings him to mary the woman of his dreams when a change in the past almost erases their relationship tim holds back on using time travel unless only for the most important things as his relationship with mary grows from friends to family tim slowly learns that sometimes one has to let go of the past in order to fully embrace the present and work toward the futureabout time is possibly one of the few romance movies that subvert the typical romance tropes it is not overly sappy or awkward like the asian ones but neither is it over sexualised or shallow as hollywood ones it is an earnest little fairy tale that refreshingly frames a love relationship into the eventual outcome of a happy marriage and a family unlike many which just ends with the couple in bed together this earnestness is helped by well written characters particularly tim who goes through a complete coming of age tale that many can relate tostarting from a socially inept teen with aspirations of dating the hottest girl in town tim soon realises that looks is not everything and settles for mary a woman who truly complements his character we follow him as he grows into a confident adult and a loving father actor domhall gleason shares perfect chemistry with rachael mcadams mary making their relationship all the more real but the true breakout character is tims elderly yet charismatic father played by bill nighly who we find out has used his time travel abilities to relive precious moments in life knowing that his life is soon coming to an endyes the movie does skimp pass the less desirable aspects of relationship to present a very idealistic image of romance the squabbles the arguments they are never present family life too skims over the baby crying at midnight the smelly diaper changes adapting ones lifestyle around the child etc but hey fairy tale is fairy tale and the movie would be three times the length if one were to go into the specifics of relationship trials and family tribulations about times only flaw is how it trips over its very own concept at the very onset two simple rules are set down about time travel 1 he cant travel forward in time 2 travelling to a time before the birth of a child will alter who that child is yet tim travels back and forth in time multiple occasions and travelling past the birth of his child only altered his child the first time subsequent time travels including one back to tims childhood did not cause such changes any newbie to science fiction can see how wrong the whole time travel gimmick works does he physically travel back in time if so why does he not meet his past self does his mind travel back in time and inhabit his past body this is true for the first half of the film where he decides to travel back to help out a friend instead of going on a date but later on he seems to be in many places at once when he travels to the past being able to do what he did and do what he wanted to do the easiest way to deal with this is to not take the time travel aspect literally instead it is merely a metaphor for a strong human tendency to revisit our past and relive precious momentsabout time brings up many life lessons if we change who we were we would never be who we are if we change what happened to us no matter how embarrassing or how negative we would never be where we are today all things good and bad happen for a reason and that reason may not seem clear at first sometimes something bad has to happen for someone to learn a lesson and change for the betterso there is no point trying to change the past one should only cherish the present for it is a gift take joy in the little things settle the negatives and live it in such a way that in the future one would never have the desire to change his past,happy
forget about the time travel to future or backward lets get down to something more reasonable this family is not a millionaires family father is a bookworm mother a typical house wife son a lamer daughter a mindless crazy spoiled brat so how come they could live without any earthly worries financial wise or money wise how come they could live in a bubblelike cocoon live so pretentiously that even the richest people on the earth couldnt live their life styles oh a regular daily activities sitting or lying on the beach drinking or daydreaming sun bath watching movies outside rain or shine dining at table eating and drinking with their obvious stupid and dumb uncle then the notquitelikearichman father told his son one day that all the men in the family got a mysterious gift of time traveling power they could travel back in time to fix some things they didnt quite like but in general they could not change the matters the history in a larger manner say like making adolf hitler never born or two world wars never happen yeah right if the screenplay endowed these timetravelcapable lamers with such huge human responsibilities guess how much budgets they got to spend for the war scenes so easily this lamer son decided to just change his romance experiences givemeabreak will you this is such a stupid and one of the worst movies about time traveling crap none of the characters in this braindead film was convincingly likable because it just built on a ridiculous budgetcut storyline love or no love for this young lamers romantic adventures is no compare with love actually and those heart warming or heart aching time travel romances folks lets go down to earth to watch some more realistic and reasoning acceptable common romances such as enough talk 2013 okay cause you dont have to travel in time to get it or got to watch the film in your backyard garden at night or in order to give you some more romantic feeling using rainmaking machine to shower you give it a rest guys who gave high praises to this stupid british movie dressed up in a costume to mimic love actually,happy
there are many contradictions and plot flaws with this film but it would be possible to overlook these if we had even been presented with a remotely satisfying piece of cinema at its start the premise seems promising  a young man has the gift of travelling through time and undoing those awkward moments early scenes in the film are actually quite engaging and amusing and bill nighy lights up the screen the problem here is that the time travel conceit sets up an expectation of a complex plot involving tortuous temporal paradoxes and moral dilemmas but the film does none of this the car accident scenario is the nearest the plot gets to the difficulty of rewriting history beyond this the story descends into a an irritating tableau of how lovely posh people live lovely lives in lovely st johns wood houses once they escape from that horrid bedsit the lead characters wed make babies and live in impossibly expensive houses the tornado at the cornwall wedding raised the tantalising possibility of the bride being hit by a falling tree setting domhnall gleesons character on a timetravel quest to prevent her death but no instead the filmmakers choose to rub our noses in their dreary middleclass bliss its all so nice so twee and so disassociated from timetravel possibly this is curtiss blandest work to date if you want to see a good tense film about timetravel go see butterfly effect the only tension you get in this anodyne romcom is rachel mcadams trying to decide which dress to put on for a dinner party it seems to take her about 20 minutes i only wish i had the gift of timetravel so that i could travel back to persuade myself not to buy tickets for this film in the first place,happy
it was a clever and emotional movie but something about time travel bothered methe first time he traveled with his sister and when he went back he realized he had a different child so he went back before going back with his sister and this problem was fixedbut he could not do that with his newborn child to see his dad he could go see his dad his 3rd kid would change and then he would go back before seeing his dad so the kid would be the sameother than that great acting especially from rachel mcadams i can see this being her best role so far i did not think playing a sweet young girl would suit her but she exceeded my expectations,happy
tim domhnall gleeson is surprised when his father bill nighy asks for a private chat on his tims 21st birthday well it is rather important thats because all male members of this particular family inherits a nifty aptitude on this allimportant year now tim will be able to time travel back to past years and relive possibly change certain happenings whoa is this true yes indeed at once tim remembers a dreadful new yeats party where the girl he was dancing with wouldnt kiss him shaking hands instead ho ho going back tim smoothly works his way into a kiss this is wonderful but wait not so much when tim finally leaves his home estate in cornwall to work as a lawyer in london he longs to find the girl of his dreams she soon appears in the form of mary rachel mcadams and after a good first meeting he records her number in his cell phone yet when tim goes to the flat he shares with a surly playwright harry tom hollander harry soon tells him that his latest play that very night was a disaster due to a key cast member forgetting his lines tim wanting to help goes back in time to prompt the actor making the play a success but alas when he goes back to his phone marys number isnt there for they never met horrors doing some quick thinking tim remembers a detail of their conversation that helps him find her again nice but will tim come to regard his ability as a blessing or a curse this lovely film from the writerdirector richard curtis of four weddings and notting hill is a delight its funny thoughtprovoking and touching while domhnall is not leading man handsome or arresting he does a fine job mcadams very beautiful does wonderfully well as his love interest other cast members including nighy lydia wilson and the rest do great work as well praise should go forth to the creators of the costumes sets and cinematography as well as a deep bow to curtis for his once again extraordinary vision the setting in cornwall is strikingly gorgeous seaside and fetching to the point of everyone longing to go there at once have you as a romcom fan been feeling neglected like me remedy that and see about time its truly about time that a movie like this comes to town,happy
about time 2013  domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams bill nighy lydia wilson lindsay duncan richard cordery joshua mcguire tom hollander margot robbie will merrick vanessa kirby cameos richard e grant richard griffiths funny and poignant romcom fantasy from filmmaker richard curtis about a young bloke amiable gleeson son of brendan who learns from his father the wonderful nighy that they both share a family secret  all the men in their brood can travel in time with his newfound power he devotes it to finding and falling in love with the babelicious mcadams with a few pitfalls and curves along the merry way curtis clever dialogue and the warmhearted performances make up for the stretch of imagination of the films premise but enjoy the ride nonetheless,happy
i have never written a review on here before but after reading some of these other reviews i feel compelled to actually tell people the truth because i am pretty positive that all the great reviews are written by the pros that get paid for itso apparently the movie is about this guy who has the ability to go back in time and change things hes lonely ends up meeting a girl changes something in time and in turn has never met her he meets her again they fall in love get married and blah blah blahheres the reality it sucks the movie premise could be good i guess but everything this guy rewinds time for is trivial and stupid the movie has one of the most unbelievable couple pairings i have seen to date it is slow the witty banter is not witty there is nothing funny about iti red boxed this movie cause the wife was interested in seeing it i made it 1 hr in but check out mentally after the first 15 minutes i couldnt stand it anymore when the movie was finished my wife came into the other room and said damn that movie took fing forever to get to anythingso the truth about this movie is its not worth the 2 hours of your life you will lose watching this i am however slightly jealous of the dude in the movie right now i wish i had the ability to go back in time so i could rent something different,happy
i saw about time as a preview guys in suits at the door telling us to turn off phones before being allowed in i can now understand whyits a gripping funny intelligent british film its better than 4 weddings love actually and notting hill even with the time travel its believabletim is played with style and depth he starts to think early on about how best to use his new found talent the way the scene at the national theatre and after helps to develop him and produces quite a subtle turning point in the film the best mans speech sequence coupled with the weding in the rain shows how tim isnt going to abuse his power he just wants things to be rightthe cast is so right its frightening the play off each other so well the photography is excellent and the writeing is curtis at his best even above his black adder worki cant praise this enough see it im sure youll never regret it,happy
none of the romantic situations seem at all genuine give a stranger at a gallery your full address sure ask your girlfriend to eat dinner alone so you can dine with a guy youve already turned down once why not propose marriage to your girlfriend when shes halfasleep even though you could easily wait until morning great idea none of this would ever happen i know its a romantic comedy and these things are built on whimsy  but its extremely difficult to identify with likable characters if you feel like nothing they ever experience would occur outside of a movie its too cosily scripted from minute one and fantasy should entail dreaming about things that could actually happen not imagining a whole new alternate reality if there are flaws with the romance then it makes the family stuff harder to take seriously too since the problem is with the root and not the branch the time travel was the easiest element of the movie for me to accept it was all the stuff around it that i found hard to credit,happy
so ive been reading through many of the bad review of this movie just out of curiosity because i found it to be very good certainly or maybe not the movie as some followers might add but also certainly a wonderful movieso what brings detach and despise to this movie to some individuals i barely found proper arguments most of those reviews i cite literally mention the word hateful disgraceful crap very boring worst movie of all time and so on but so far most if not all of these reviews fall to give a proper if any argument to support their opinion might it be a matter of hatre to sensitiviness or life meanings what brings this portion of the population so much into this unexplicable hate who knowsthis piece of little art is sensitive comprehensive not cheesy at all at all and surely not scifilike at all despite of its argument basis it is not even a proper romantic love story because as a matter of fact although it plays with the love relationship of the main characters it extends it so much so much and talks about other forms of love such as paternal love some might experience that at times it might become overwhelminwonderful movie and a must see sorry for my crappy english it is not my mother language but yet before detractors burn me down for that it is a must see,happy

youve already read what the story is about so i wont bore you with the details ill go straight to the point the music this is an awesome comedy romance story but what intrigued me the most was the music have actually been playing most of the songs over and over on my phone since the music includes pop soft rock rb soul from people like the killers sexsmith winehouse tatu coming at just the right moments in the movie a few of the songs have actually been redone with an about time version incl the theme song and the result is very good the music i think is what brings out the moments in this movie that have resulted in curtis work ending up being awesome take the funny elmondo song that tim decides would be the main song for his wedding dint think mary would agree to it but alas so watch the movie listen to the music and some of it might actually end up growing on you,happy
the main reason im writing this review is due to the fact that most of the negative reviewers on imdb seem to have missed the point of this film entirely im not going to go into much detail as i think the film speaks for itself and i hate it when people put spoilers in their reviewsits not a romantic comedy as most would have you believe its a comedydrama that revolves around the relationship between a father and son the romantic themes are just a small part of this great filmonce you stop thinking of it as a romcom you will see the brilliance of it all its not the greatest film of all time its not the prettiest the funniest or the best writtenwhat it is is a heartfelt tale of a fatherson relationship the time travel elements are just a plot device the romance just a plot device its laugh out loud funny in spots and tearjerking in others its well written but still light and breezy when it needs to belook past the surface of this film and feel the emotion that these fine actors bring to the screen let go and just enjoy it for what it is,happy
went into the movies with low expectations at most i was going to have a laugh here and there and then go home ready to forget this movie and think about what ill watch next week could not have been more wrong it blew me away what started as a another formulaic romcom quickly into a highly witty and extremely funny story it then shift into a very deep and inspirational gear without losing the first 2 elements the story is surprising giving that the core is not really the developing romance between the character of tim and mary but is in the fact the relationship between tim and his father the scenes with bill nighy and domhall where nothing short of witty charming and moving it does have its plot holes involving the whole time travel thing but they are irrelevant to the soul of the story unless youre a scifi nut in which case in youre the wrong movie if youre someone looking for a film experience then about time is a mustsee 2 hours of laughing awe and moving feelings ultimately it just hit home,happy
a pretty enjoyable ride the time travel thing is an interesting plot device and isnt really overused or over explained when tim is told by his time traveling father that he too has inherited the ability to travel back in time to a scenario in which he was present and possibly change the effect on things he is at first thrilled at the possibility after a couple of times gone sour though he realizes its not as easy or as useful as he thought although a bit entertaining for the audienceafter using mostly his wit uncharismatic personality and specific details from the past he is able to nail down the girl he is interested in he doesnt use his gift for a while or see his dad for a while which i think was a weakness in the movie the director goes back to the well for the emotions at the end of the film with tims father and i just thought this relationship couldve been built up a bit more throughout the moviethe relationship with tim gleeson and mary mcadams moves pretty fast it has sentimental sweet moments but its just okay same as the supporting cast and music its all just alright once tim and mary have kids it gets a little more serious and sentimental and its interesting the end of the film does get a bit moving with the whole life death and time travel thing its entertaining and worth watching but for a movie from the creators of notting hill and love actually its not on the same level as those notting hill had few characters but they all shone and the writing dialogue music characters etc were on a whole different level than this film,happy
this film will eat the inside of your brain out by the time you get to the end  and if you do you will have let richard curtis destroy all the lovely things that life has to offer by presenting them not just once badly but endless numbers of times badly thanks totime travellet me go back in time and say that again with a slight twist to make it betterthis film will eat the inside of your brain out by the time you get to the end  and if you dont you will have taken my advice and skipped possibly the worst movie of this or any other centurylet me go back in time and say that again without the mindgutting headache this film has left me with so that i can reperform this act of public servicethats better we could always watch about time nah lets close our eyes clench our fists and imagine a train wreck insteadyoure starting to feel better already too,happy
the premise of the film  every male member of a nauseatingly happy family has the ability to go back in time by going into a wardrobe thinking of the time they want to go back to and clenching their fiststhis requires a suspension of belief of course as physics tells us this is rather sillyour narrator and central character is told this by the man who claims to be his father i say claims because tim is ginger haired and noone else in his family is this is never explored in the filmthe restrictions of the time travelling are explained by his father to let us all know the parameters of the filmplot he cant go further back than his own birth and he shouldnt go chasing after money because his uncle fred did and it didnt make him happythere is no philosophical discussion about possibly intervening to prevent disasters such as 911 or warn people of coming tsunamisour tim decides he will use his magic power to find lovewhat follows is the usual formulaic claptrap found in most other films richard curtis has been involved in such as love actually notting hill and four weddings and a funeralit is set in britain  a britain aimed at an american audience where everyone has a nice clear and quaint accent is a tiny bit eccentric and drinks teahe falls for surprise surprise an american girl they have the most vomit inducing perfect happy little relationship anyone has ever had the second hour of the film is just pure tediousness they never row get sick or have money troubles our tim does not use his power to sleep with lots of girls and go back and then not dothere is a mysterious uncle who has a touch of alzheimers we perhaps expect this to be a subplot and his condition has been caused by going back in time too much this is never delved into though and he just seems to be there for humourperhaps the most ridiculous aspect of the film is failure to fully explore the consequences of going back in time would have for example he goes back together with his father to when he was a boy by doing so he would have condemned himself to have to follow the exact same course of his life as he had previously knowing for the next twenty years every single event that would happen both to him and in the world it is not explained how for example he dealt with being a child whilst having the memories of having had intimate relationships with women we just see him strolling along the beach with his dad and are left to believe that somehow his life followed the same pattern as beforegroundhog day this aint one to give a miss,happy
i dont even know what to write about the logistics of the time travel aspect as it doesnt make sense and they know it time travel really isnt the point so why bother dissecting it anyway time travel is used only as plot device to toy with your emotions but actually what it truly does is remove any drama that the main couple will get together time travel solves everything in his relationship with her except that this movie dragged on forever i lost count how many times i thought that it could end maybe i was hoping more than anything richard curtis maybe a great screenwriter but he certainly knows nothing about directing i am glad that he proclaimed that he wasnt directing after this does he think anyone cares the pacing is so meandering with different subplots that then were very quickly solved with time travel i also want to mention that for long periods of time time travel is not used even when i think it should have been it is too boring to go into details just trust me the major theme of the movie is not wasting each moment of your life which is kind of ironic with time travel used as a means of exploring that idea here is the problem time travel is only used so he can manipulate the women of his dreams into falling in love with him this makes their relationship unreal because while he maybe in love with her she is only in love with the make believe version of him the much better sub plot or comain plot is the time traveling father and son relationship mr curtis should have focused mainly on their relationship as it had a real emotional payoff at the end this leads into what i thought of the acting rachel mcadams was completely wasted by the way can screenwriters find a different occupation other than lawyer play write or book editor she and domhnall had zero chemistry zero plus what was the deal with all the kate moss references just terrible the opening scene of them together worked but only because the scene was entirely in the dark domhnall did start to grow into the role but only in the scenes with his father bill nighy was good and really stole the show from the leads the rest of the cast was your typical poorly written romcom family members especially the uncle nothing they did was interesting or the least bit funny kit kat actually showed some interest in the beginning before falling victim to a time travel plot story line i will say that the music in this movie was really above average so great job nick lairdclowes in conclusion mr curtis wasted the unique time travel element and rachel mcadams two unforgivable sins stay away,happy
i hate this film i hate it because its so bad so bad i think it gave me ocular cancer i wish i could cut out my eyes and replace them with the eyes of someone who hasnt seen this film only then would my life have any semblance of order again it is soppy whimsical heartstring pulling middle england balls and i hate it dick curtis is a bum loser and i hope he falls down a manhole and loses the ability to write with his hands thus ending his reign of terror over cinemai hope in the future this film is shown to terrorists as a form of torture because that is the only way i feel it can be put to good use i feel sorry for every person who took part in the creation of this film i only wasted two hours of my life on this trash but they had several weeks of theirs completely destroyed by this travesty my sympathies go out to them and if they are considering a class action lawsuit against dick curtis i would be more than happy to contribute,happy
about time four stars out of five writerdirector richard curtis who wrote and directed the critically acclaimed hits love actually and pirate radio as well as wrote or cowrote other british romcoms like four weddings and a funeral and bridget joness diary helmed this time travel romantic comedydrama it stars domhnall gleeson whos most famous for playing bill weasley in the last two harry potter films as a 21yearold lawyer in training who discovers he can time travel and uses his gift to get a girlfriend rachel mcadams costars as the number one object of his affection and bill nighy plays his time travelling dad the film is as much a fatherson tale as it is a romance but that didnt keep the theater i saw it in from being filled with 90 female viewers as far as romcoms go its pretty good but thats to be expected from curtisgleeson plays tim who is 21yearsold when his father nighy tells him their big family secret that the males in the family can time travel he explains that they can only go back in time and they cant change history tim decides to use his special abilities to win over a woman he first tries it on his sisters friend margot robbie who stays with his family one summer but learns that his gift cant make someone fall in love with him then when he moves to london to study as a lawyer he meets mary mcadams and the two immediately hit it off as he continually time travels though to try and fix things in their relationship and his relationships with others he keeps complicating things and making them worse as well as betteri last saw mcadams as a gorgeous and evil femme fatale in the brian de palma thriller passion and she was fantastic in it she used to be one of my favorite actresses but shes done so many bad romantic comedies and other crap like that that shes kind of lost my interest so it was great to see her doing something completely different and good in passion here shes doing another romcom as the standard cute and sweet leading female love interest role but shes great at it too shes the heart of the film and really drives the viewers involvement in the story gleeson is a good and likable lead as well and curtiss script although flawed and directing are brilliant it is another romantic comedy but it also has a scifi fantasy twist and was in the hands of a good director mcadams shines in the movie and everyone else in it is more than adequate as well its emotionally moving and definitely worth seeing not just another bad chickflickwatch our movie review show movie talk at httpyoutubejrx8unvogb0,happy
richard curtis understands romance its been almost two decades since he wrote his masterpiece four weddings and a funeral a loving examination of how quirky looking for happiness could be yet it was old fashioned real and very good he goes behind the camera this time with his own script this only means another winnerthere are some liberties taken with the concept of time in the movie but its interesting to see how through tim we are able to live our fantasies the opportunity to have a second chance and being able to correct a few of our mistakesthe most winning part of the project is the casting with every single performer giving winning performances the most loving portrayal comes from mcadams glowing sweet and lovely with one of the most fantastic smiles i have seen in a recent film watching her react to tims initial moves is a joy and her wedding scene is a romantic classicthe film like weddings manages to feel real and balance moments of happiness with a few incident of grief the best is to see the realization that these people act like real people and are representing our dreams giving us an opportunity to at least experience some of their joyenjoy,happy
for me the main draw was seeing from the creator of love actually on the poster as well as seeing bill nighy and rachel mcadams name attached add on that this seemed like a cute scifi love story and i was even more entranced however upon seeing the film i must say i do feel a bit trickedcast and storythe film focuses on a young man named tim played by domhnall gleeson who comes off as a sort of loser when we meet him however upon his father played by bill nighy revealing that the men in their family can time travel things look like they could pick up however upon moving to london things dont seem to be going well for him as he lives with his fathers friend harry played by tom hollander who is a brilliant writer but also a butt hole and sadly his little sister kit kat played by lydia wilson isnt doing so well either but what tim does have going for him is a job as a lawyer but it is at a firm which doesnt respect him or partner rory played by joshua mcguire who is such a sweetheart all that much however thanks to his old friend jay played by will merrick  known for generation 3 of skins to me anyway he meets the love of his life mary played by rachel mcadams which leads to a rather sped up relationship which quickly establishes them as a couple as the movie moves on to the true focus tims family specifically nighy as the eccentric dad and little sis kit kat who is the equally eccentric daughter for most of the movie mary is more so there to support tim as he deals with the troubles of a sister who isnt really prepared for adulthood and a father whose mortality is becoming more apparent thus leading to a movie which may not be romantic but can be a tearjerkerpraisewhich to me saved this movie the family ties are written so well that you can forgive being duped kit kat is lovable zany and truly hard to not root for during her struggles then with nighys character he makes you think of your relationship with your own father and you almost feel like tim reminiscing over the good times trying to avoid the bad and trying to relive those moments which soon will only exist in your own memories also i felt the use of tim and nighys character use of their time travel ability was used just right often times it was used to fix an awkward or unsatisfying moment which was usually built into a joke however there were also times when the reason wasnt selfish in the sense where they are trying to make the situation perfect tim uses the gift to help harrys play be perfect and nighys character who is simply known as dad uses it to make the perfect toast for his sons wedding then there is one time specifically is which there isnt a minor sacrifice but something which would lead to major changed in tims life by changing the past and i have to say i appreciated that at least once they really showed that this power had the ability to flip his life and they made tim make a hard decision about using said powercriticismwhich leads to my sole criticism which is the romantic movie sold in the trailer is weak for one the romance is rushed and afterwards it is easy not to care for one once he gets the information he needs to be with mary there is no challenge anymore basically he screws up a few times to establish the relationship and once it is done it is done there is no real build trials or tribulations or anything which makes you fall in love with them in a way it feels so fated that it is like they were an established couple from the beginning but this isnt to say they arent cute together and that rachel mcadams loses that sort of meg ryan in the 90s appeal ie she seems like she can be anyones love interest and make it work if anything the problem is that you are forced to adapt to a story you werent sold on watching for 2 hoursoverall worth seeingthough i felt a bit like i was sold on one thing and given something else i didnt feel jipped for while i didnt get a cute romantic movie featuring rachel mcadams i did get to see a beautifully done movie about family ties one which truly made me cry laugh a dozen or so times and made me think that they could have easily advertised the movie for what it is and still have gotten my money this is why i think it is worth watching you may not get a strong romance between man and woman but you still do see a cute and fun setup to it and the relationship isnt bad just not the focal point you expect it to be however to compensate the film does a good job at showing the interdependency of family from wanting to be the dad your own dad wasnt loving a family member no matter how odd or off they are and being there for someone when they are drowning and are seemingly at the point where perhaps fighting for air doesnt seem worth the effort anymore this film gives you a true look at the importance of family and how that importance and love extends to extended family,happy
i watched the prescreening last night and was absolutely spellbound besides amazing cinematography and acting the story is what touches your heart and soul this is a movie that will make you want to give your dad an extra hug your sister a kiss on the forehead and call up a longlost friend this is one of the very best movies ive ever seen in my life and i have a feeling it will be a classic for me to watch time and time again if you like what a wonderful life youll love this movie i highly recommend this movie and plan to buy several copies to give as gifts when it comes out on bluray see it,happy
it is not a great movie by any means its plot is ludicrous and full of logical holesbut it that rare true feel good film there are probably less than twenty films that i have watched more than 2 times in my life three of them are films that i watch when i need to get out of a funk i would imagine a lot of people have films that do that for them classics like its a wonderful life or forrest gump for instance but for me they are harold and maude breaking away and the much less well known but very special film  let it ride about time is now number 4 on the list i really dont see this as much as a romantic comedy as a film about learning to wake up and smell the roses i left the theater so full of thoughts about how to approach life and what is important see this film when you are feeling like life just sucks cause you will leave the theater feeling just the opposite i will add this film to my very small dvd collection when it is released normally there are just too many films that i have not seen and want to see for me to spend a couple hours with repeated viewings but i am sure i will need an about time fix at least once a year,happy
this is a romantic comedy that is more about making you feel good rather than laughing out louddomhnall gleeson excels as the likable ginger tosser tim and rachael mcadams is fantastic as the awkward vulnerable girlnextdoor mary watching their relationship progress with the help of tims time travelling abilities tugs on all the heart strings multiple timesalthough the story is fantastic it is fairly basic and never dips in to the realms of silly all the characters are great especially mary who takes adorable to new heightsimportant time travel is not possible so dont let your mind wander into the realms of paradoxes dichotomies and the general mechanics of tims abilities this is not a scifi you need to concentrate on feeling not thinking for this film to worki sat for most of the film with a big stupid grin on my face but im not afraid to admit it tears in my eyes by the end fantastic feel good movie,happy
on new years day of his 21st year tim lake domhall gleeson learns from his dad bill nighy that the men in their family can travel back in time to specific moments in their lives there will be rules that cannot be violated lest past events altered will give rise to completely different outcomes naturally kindhearted tim uses this power to get himself a girlfriend among other goodintentioned deeds in conscious groundhog day scenarios domhnall gleeson whom we will recognize as one of the elder weasley brothers in the harry potter series felt really sincere as dorky tim and his relationship with insecure mary sweetly played by rachel mcadams already the heroine of love stories like the notebook and the time travellers wife was very disarming indeed they were an ideal couple here the scenes on how he successfully got mary to be his girlfriend and their very different wedding and the reception were their best scenes together ok gleeson may look a bit younger than mcadams but you still cant deny that their positive chemistry was truly palpablehowever despite this being marketed as a romantic love story i felt more emotionallyconnected with the scenes played between tim and his quirky family especially tim and his dad there may have been scenes which violate the very rules upon which their timetraveling is based but the sentiment was so poignant i decided to just overlook themthe cinematography of the cornwall coastal panorama and the streets of london were very charming the perfectlytimed entrance of selected pop oldies and ethereal new songs adds to the emotional atmosphere created by the situationssome scenes that i felt went a little too long contributing to a running time of more than two hours the whole side plot about beautiful charlotte margot robbie could have been shortened as well as that endless scene where mary was choosing a dress to wear to an event overall though this is a very pleasant british love story by richard curtis who wrote and directed classics like four weddings and a funeral notting hill and love actually again like his other films about time is also about love and family but this one had an actual fantasy element in play and that unique magical touch adds to the fun and the romance of the story,happy
old reviewers secret its called the watch test if during the film you have to look at your watch to see how much time is left the film loses points appropriately the test once mentioned by the late roger ebert works because it requires so many subliminal and subconscious cues to generate the behavior and this film fails the watch test most viewers will check their watch or phone or mobile device more than once because it is overlong and because there are weak points in the script which is itself astonishing because this is a richard curtis film love actually and many more hits and if richard curtis were to sire a horse you would expect that horse to win the derby now before you dismiss this review i encourage you to do a test  watch the time travelers wife which by coincidence is also about time travel and also stars mcadams and you will see what i am getting at so that aside what we have here is a very strong film that purports to be about a sci fi theme but really is about family and brothers and sisters and friends and relations and mothers and children the time travel is really incidental as the ending makes clear also curtis who also directed seems to have gone out of his way to tone down mcadams who usually glows in her films see red eye this is accomplished by mcadams herself who does an excellent job of keeping her charisma in check and by giving her a haircut that makes her look like a squirrel good film but you cant avoid the feeling it could have been better,happy
i dont know what is it with this new movies they really got bad so few moves are actually good the 90s and early 2000s are the best era for movies i cant believe this movie got this high of a review i mean it is ok funny sometimes and sure they can be witty but overall it doesnt seem really to be that good it gets really boring as it continues on but there are no big plot twists nothing that makes you not be able to pause it and watch it again in a week or a year so i am sorry but this movies should really have been thought out better it resembles the movie time travelers wife they even used the same actress but it is not as good,happy
this film is mildly recommendedthat tried and true formula about time travel is working overtime in about time a pleasing but slight little comedy just how many films have successfully taken this plot device and made it fresh and appealing not many midnight in paris back to the future twelve monkeys big time after time and the terminator come to mind however the number of movies which take that gimmick to hackneyed and overdone results seem endless bill and teds excellent adventure the time travelers wife the philadelphia experiment premonition kate and leopold 17 again the adjustment bureau the lake house the butterfly effect frequency somewhere in time and the final countdown all misfires that still boggle my mind with about time many moviegoers will find this latest version of time hopping delightful even romantic i found it to be an innocuous trifle a diverting enough two hours of amusement the film has its charm mostly due to its likable cast but it follows that overused what if timechanging formula and rarely pushes its own limits it stay safely within the lines and never wants to journey outside the box at least until its conclusion the simple story follows the familiar road map of time travel ala groundhog day another pleasant comedy with the same theme in mind tim is without a love connection a misfit on the dating scene after a fatherson discussion on his 21st birthday he suddenly learns that he can change what has happened in his own life to his advantage his past mistakes can now be rectified and his future looks more promising with this newly acquired power although he cannot change history he can relive those awkward moments and at least somewhat control his own destiny and finally get a girlfrienddomnhall gleeson plays tim and he is fine in this role its not a real stretch but he makes his character believable even with this unbelievable setup rachel mcadams is his love interest mary and this actress also generates some innovation to a clichd role there is a strong chemistry between the two young actors which helps to elevate the predictability of the film even better is bill nighy as tims wise father nighy brings subtlety and warmth to his patriarch role and his acting skills are precise and spotonrichard curtis wrote and directed this movie his specialty seems to be the romantic comedy genre the annoying bridget jones diary the better notting hill and love actually films and the superb four weddings and a funeral  and this film is one of his minor efforts this time his script starts off way too cute and takes awhile to build any real emotion or tension the film is almost stuck in its own selfimposed time warp afraid to jump from sentimental sit com situations to honest adult issues its not until the midpoint of the film that about time finally deals with familial complications that directly affect the relationship between tim and mary and only then does the film begin to become compelling still as with other films of this genre this film falls prey to the illogic of time travel and its proliferation of selective changes and their lack of repercussions that never mesh with the characters sense of realityperhaps if curtis had spent more time and more initial rewritings with his screenplay about time would have become a more memorable love story as it is its not the worst of times you will have but then its not the best either grade bany comments please contact me at jadepietrorcncom,happy
my wife and i managed to attend a free screening of this movie yesterday and we had no idea what it was about before hand all i knew was what the synopsis said which felt completely wrong when we watched itthe story was written and directed by richard curtis of vicar of dibley fame and contains a mixture of american and british actors and australian  it is a romance with a time travel theme being able to go back to a time in the past in order to relive it what surprised us about the movie is that it doesnt go down cheap routes plots where other movies would have gone down ie oh no i am going to cheat on my woman and go with my ex  which is really refreshingmy wife described this movie like an onion many layers of it  each one different i would agree bill nighly was brilliant as was lindsay duncan  very good couple together on screen the main actorsactresses were all very warming and the chemistry was fantastic rachel mcadams and domhnall gleeson were brilliant  you got a real sense of their relationship in the movie from him being a bumbling fool but harmless to her being very charming and sweetdefinitely recommend this movie as a date night movie  or simply one that you can enjoy with your partner and come out feeling warm inside probably one of my movies of the year  which is saying something as i am more of an action person go see it take your partner your mother your sister your best friend or a complete stranger that you have kidnapped so you have someone to watch this movie with ok dont do that but you get my drift ,happy
one of the best if not the best of the time travel movies,happy
for fans of heartfelt witty english cinema i thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters,happy
one of the best romcoms i have watched for a long time its funny and storyline is very well developed to keep the audience intrested throughout the movie,happy
wow i took a chance on this movie  i just ugly cried my eyes out loved it even though it made me cry though bit of a twist on time travel gives you amazing perspective at the end i wont spoil it lets just say i picked my daughter up  danced around the living room laughing  crying to the song while the credits rolled,happy
an amazing movieit we cant change our past we can definitely improve our future how starting from the present focusing on the beauty of each moments we live in our unchangeable routine our livesa 1010 masterpiece,happy
some scenes have logic errors but the movie is generally nice i like the relationship between father and son,happy
life is precious and we so often waste our days watch this and remind yourself to love fully boomso good,happy
its not perfect but delivers exactly what i wanted these days its refreshing to really appreciate the actors the father was amazing and to have a mix of feelings from laughs to tears well done i was not expecting this at all,happy
i loved it the first time i saw it and loved it again tonight its a feelgood movie and maybe it can be a bit preachy but its message is an important one told in a lighthearted fun way,happy
i watched this movie on hbo and had never heard of it wow what a great movie the message throughout it was so poignant live your life like every day is your last this movie hit home so much with me because i lost my father when i was only 6 years old and never really knew him im 40 now with an 11 year old son of my own but what made the movie so great is the writing acting and just about everything else i love rachel mcadams and she delivers another notebook like performance the rest of the cast was brilliant domhnall gleeson meshed so well with rachel mcadams but again the underlying message about living each day as if its your last is so well done this movie is one of those movies i always watch when i come across it,happy
i absolutely adore this movie although some parts are a little unrealistic which should be expected since its a movie with time travel its still a great story rachel mcadams is perfect for any romantic comedy movie i thought domhnall gleeson was very charming and quirky although he is very attractive he definitely is not the typical handsome guy you seen in most romance movies which i think adds to his charm margot robbie is beautiful and flawless as usual i think it would have been difficult for most guys to turn her down so props to timthe plot is mainly about love but it also focuses on family life and death even my boyfriend who hates all cheesy romantic things loved this movie,happy
amazing i can always watch it again without getting tired,happy
i cannot say that this movie is the better one actually i think is pretty basic but it makes you feel sad happy and desperate even with a movie who develops a plot full of cliches the emotions that cause in the viewer are a big point for the moviethey start creating expectatives in the viewer when i saw it i was thinking great this movie is about time traveling sadly at the end they put this ability in second term what we can rescue from this movie is the message they send an incredible moral about life and to make the viewer understand it they show us how the characterss life change through the years happy and sad moments that almost everyone experience,happy
funny heartwarming and makes me cry everytime i watch it by far the best romantic comedy ive ever seen,happy
while i was at the rental store with my friend we wouldve probably been there forever if she hadnt just decided on the fifth film for me she chose about time and promised me it was really good i was sceptical as i often am when someone else chooses a film for me to watch and now that this movie is after i know at least one friend whose taste i can trusti liked the plot almost instantly usually im not fond of any love related plots and by that i mean how the main character knew he wanted to find love still it was clear that wasnt the only thing he was searching for moving to london he wanted to find his place his future and that was something many of us can relate to finding love just happened along the way tho it was a bit frustrating to watch how dumb can you be travelling back in time without realising then you never met the girl and why did he keep trying to find her sure they are great together but still it seemed a bit bothersome one of the nicest scenes in this movie  and there are a lot  was the one in the dark restaurant where neither the characters nor the audience can see it was amazing to see how well tim and mary clicked even though they didnt even see each other because of that the first sight of mary was so special these kind of romantic movies seem to have the same structure so i kept waiting for something tremendously bad to happen like some misunderstand which would lead to awful things that would eventually turn out to be good and all that but about times structure is different time isnt simple and the events in tims life are just that  they are life they are normal things and his life is relatively normal apart from the time travelling thing its really nice and its very beautiful about time is a very beautiful funny and touching movie its amazing and im really glad my friend chose it for me,happy
i started this movie knowing the basic plot and that it would star rachel mcadams i didnt really see her as one of my favourite actresses until now i saw her in the cast and knew i was going to enjoy this movietims awkward and clumsiness bounces between cringeworthy and endearing the music of the time is nostalgic even though 2013 was only a few years ago it feels like forever maybe because i dont listen to music much anymore and its a throwback to when i didthe moral of the movie is that time is short try to live every day without worry and noticing all the sweet victories the little things you can only do this day once make it count make your interactions with the people in your life people you meet mean something because this day could your or their lastit was a really nice movie touching it made me feel all of the emotions except anger but it didnt make me cry just the right amount of feelings it was great id watch it again its one of those movies that make you want a family even though i dont want kids,happy
a very lovely movie which teaches me to live my life fully it teaches me to notice and enjoy the good things happening in my life among all the tension and worriesit is not a typical love story but a very different one this movie shows you love in its purest form this movie shows love between father and son brother and sister husband and wife and makes me realise the importance of family the relationship between tim and mary is also very heart touching the movie makes me happy and leaves an impact on me you will definitely revisit some of the happy scenes in the movie very good acting and good background musicoverall an amazing feelgood movie,happy
this movie did two things completely right that most movies dontim not a fan of time travel movies usually i sit gritting my teeth at the sheer audacity of the writers as they attempt to suspend my disbelief to the point that i would have to just accept anything they throw at me unfortunately time travel is a sticky subject that is so hard to get right but so beautiful to watch and immerse yourself in when it succeedsabout time got it right this is the first of two things it does very wellfrom the very beginning this treasure of a tale does not try to blind you with science nor use you as some instant stooge to work its lame magic tricks instead it comes right out with the plot at a very early stage when the amazing bill nighy just outright tells his son that he can time travel and thats that sure this is ludicrous in its own right but its done in such a playful and selfaware way that you cant help but chuckle and go along for the ride i loved the idea that there are rules to this incredibly simple method of time travel never forwards only backwards and the true dangers of what might happen are laid bare in a very intelligent and heartfelt way the second thing that it did well was the theme the subtle message that we receive at the end of this movie can be found in every book on mindfulness buddhism religion selfhelp book and basically anywhere else where someone claims to know the meaning of true happiness in a movie about time travel you would expect there to be many selfish attempts to attain wealth fame and sex although there is one scene where this is used to great effect about time however doesnt bash you over the head with the clich boytalk idea of what time travel is for it approaches it in a mature and yet intriguing way where on occasion you are unsure where the path will lead but when you arrive you realise you probably should have trusted the main character a little more i wont reveal what the theme was or how it affects those who witness it on quite a deep level but i will say that you will have heard it before from someone and thought well everyone knows that but we just forget every time that is how we should be living our lives there are parts where the plot could have used more work and the movie seemed to stagnate the subplot with the protagonists sister for instance was a little stale and i didnt really feel as sorry for her as the writers wanted me to i was also not really conflicted at all throughout the plot to the degree where i was squirming in my seat or really gulping for fear of the unknown these are not major criticisms though the movie played it safe and i was a happy observer i felt the tone was soft and fluffy the characters were animated and interesting my favourite has to be the uncle who i felt stole the show whenever he had screen time great characteri thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour run time and i would definitely do it again with close friends just to show them what a gem it is and discuss what they felt about the interwoven message,happy
this revie may contain spoilersi love this movie so i watched this movie many times especially when i feel depressed because this movie make me comfortable and happy when i saw this movie at first i envied protagonist because of his power that make him can travel in time but its not why i love this movie the reason is that i could realize this moment never come back again therefore i thought id better try to enjoy every moment also i was thinking about my future imagining like maybe i will be like that someday watching this movie what i want to say is i felt positive things about life or family from this movie so if you have times watch this movieadditionally i really like rachel mcadams she is so lovely and adorable especially when she smile,happy
starring domnhall gleeson and rachel mcadams this movie teaches you about life love and to live every moment like its your last add time travel to that showcasing many bitter sweet instances of life this movie is a must watch favourite quote  and in the end i think ive learned the final lesson from my travels in time and ive even gone one step further than my father did the truth is i now dont travel back at all not even for the day i just try to live every day as if ive deliberately come back to this one day to enjoy it as if it was the full final day of my extraordinary ordinary life  tim i have now started finding better movies through wwwflickstreecom it not only suggests great movies to watch it also tells where you can watch the movie online highly recommended,happy
a man discovers he can travel in time and sets out to find lovestarring domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams and bill nighywritten and directed by richard curtiswell i am a sucker for any movie that includes time travel so how could i resist this oneokay its more love actually than the time machine if you add a dash of groundhog day but its a really good feel good film its funny and witty in all the right places and its really cleverly written it more than keeps you interested for every scene normally i wouldnt really consider myself to be a romcom kind of guy but this is an exceptiondomhnall gleeson as the lead is a little bit of a wimp and the part could easily have been played by hugh grant but that aside he still played a good part as did everybody elsethis is one i would recommendenjoyed 910,happy
i really enjoyed this movie it was charming subtle and clever a welcome break from a steady diet of sex and violence in the movies thought provoking and intelligent it had two stars on my on demand most likely rated by bored teenagers maybe they would have rated it higher if it opened with a car chase and an assault rifle glad i ignored the ratings and watched it anyway made my night and it has made me think about being in the present moment and enjoying my life just a bit morei would watch it again,happy
if you dont fall for this movie  there is something terribly wrong with you ok there are many fantastical dreamy elements  so what if i wanted real life i would look in the garbage bags under the kerb it is done with just enough humour and without any soppy drivel the warm intelligent script editing and filming developing characterization unpredictable story  and yes accents  are just so right ok there shades of groundhog day  but what story doesnt beg steal or borrow it aims to address all the various roles that a man hopes to go through in life being a son falling in love being a husband dad brother work mate friend without being overtly sentimental it was about time that somebody made a romcom for men the interacting of bill nighy  domhnall gleeson is a joy richard curtis is the king of this genre and i really feel that he will be very hard pressed to top this,happy
i am not really into the kind of film which is full of love actually themes but about time caught me unawares and i was drawn into the easy story line on the surface there is no great difficulty in understanding this film  its about love love between a man and woman love within the family love of a father for his son quite often films are full of danger violence and bad language  where the fword appears in every sentence this is not like that there is sex but it is beautiful awkward funny and passionate the acting is good because it is lifelike this film says this is what life can beand it is easy to see how this could be so there are great philosophical themes too what could happen if one is able to travel back through time and undo ones faults and mistakes i like this film very much it made me laugh at my own stupidity and cry because i loved my dad who is now dead i could quite easily see myself putting it in my desert island list of films to save from the waves,happy
i dont know what else a person could want in a movie its one of those movies where everyone all ages could like aside from maybe one or two scenes not only was it quaint witty and relateable but refreshingly real and the acting was great i guess you could classify it as a romantic comedy but honestly it felt more like one of those movies that sums up what being a human is about it goes into the everyday moments and traumas of life but overall is very lighthearted and sweet i would wish for everyone to see this movie personally i loved this movie and i loved the individual characters very strong character development,happy
i really enjoyed watching this movie i never knew domhnall gleeson could pull off a english accent he really made us irish proud lolhe really was very charming in this film i bet rachel mcadams couldnt wait to give him a big smack on the kiss since they were such a good couple on screen together i loved the way there was a lot of time traveling going on and it makes you definitely want to go back in time yourself i mean i would love to fix mistakes and see great memories in the past unfortunately i just have to go with the flow and suck it up i say everyone would agree with me on that account lolbill nighy who played the father was absolutely brilliant i was so sad when his character died of cancer hes like this adoring father who anyone would love to have i even liked his voice too he has like this david attenborough voice that really makes you fall asleep yknow i was so surprised to have seen margot robbie she is like the best actress out there and i knew she would be successful from me seeing her on the australian soap neighbours to being on hollywood she did a killer british accent on this too im glad domhnall gleesons character didnt get matched with her because they wouldnt suit as a couple but anyway luckily it didnt happen of course its heartbreaking that this was richard griffiths last film an excellent actor who i looked up to during his time in harry potter may he rest in peace really good film ,happy
i watched this movie a few years ago and loved it i walked in my classroom and my students were watching it and i insisted that it be transferred to my usb so i could watch it again my friend came to visit me for christmas and we went through several ok films and then i suggested we watch this one again im glad i did he enjoyed it as wellthis film evoked emotion on so many levels for me the feeling of falling in love the desire to be able to go back and change certain moments however how small is something we can all relate to i have to say i really like domhnall g there is something so innocent and charming about him and id put his narration voice right on mt rushmore next to james earl jones and morgan freeman in regards to making the audience feel whoever wrote the lines he released from his mouth during his narration has a soul and its evident i have always been a fan of rachel mcadams and in spite of her ridic haircut in the beginning id say she was equally charming but not as cute as she was in wedding crashersthere were so many things that worked for me but none more so than the relationship between father and son i was reminded of my dad and the things wed do together the last 20 minutes of the film resulted in the juiciest of eyeballs for me especially when they went for that one last walk and dg was a kid touching stuff my friend remarked at the endthat was good and a day or so later told me that after watching the film he knew it was time to go home he lives in shanghai and had made the decision to move back home to the usa after having taught overseas since 2008 this is my favorite film in the last decade or so since before sunsetsunrise,happy
mcadams clicks with me dom is every bachelor nighy is the dad we all want the movie and theme about thinking before you speak resonates as a husband parent boss and friend this is easier for some thanks for a most enjoyable story you should see this movie for its original artistry imho it will not disappoint and provide lots of discussion even a year later you get the feeling that curtis looks at his work and has to be proud of the team he put together and their output id like to know how many takes that takes two more lines to convince amazon to publish me suggesting this movie is a go see is troublesome at times when words fail lawson di ransom canyon,happy
the main character in this story has the ability to travel in time to any moment of his life not caring about his ability of traveling back in his own life this movie is only a romantic movie to me the casting is a very important part in any movie this movie got 1010 in casting from the not good looking guy to the weird uncle the logic of the story is perfectly described except for one little thing that you will find it in the goofs the story made the character as well as his father use this ability as an advantage to find his love but it did not secure him from life difficulties the time traveling makes the movie so beautifully romantic but the story structure still teach you a life lesson in many directions such as work love and family issues this movie is definitely one of the top romantic movies that does not goes into fiction,happy
this movie is very emotive but also very funny i think is some kind of serious romantic comedy but in the end is more than thatthe idea of mix romantic comedy with science fiction is fresh for a western movie usually this is more used by east films and was very well reachedabout the cast i think they could have found a better protagonist i am not very convinced by this actor but the rest of the cast is very suitedi would liked if this movie were more family friendly a lot of adult jokes and innecessary implicit sex scenes and themes were not necessaries and maybe this movie could be a familiar movie but at the end i like it as well,happy
recently watched this movie about time which had me yelling bravo it is about a young brit who finds out that he can time travel but only to events that has occurred in his life watch the different momentous choices he makes with this new found power this movie is thought provoking funny and should be a course of study in the school of life what would you change if you could or should you what moments do you most cherish to what extent would you go to save the ones you love can you really harness a moment this movie is well thought out and delivers it is a life changing tool for those who live in the past or only seek the future for those who truly understand the beauty of the moment you too will be yelling bravo catch this film currently running on hbo pop some corn and curl up in your favorite chair you are about to enter the enlightenment zone enjoyand let me know if you have seen it bsb,happy
i simply adore the movie mainly because of the fact that it is far away and different from the mainstream movies less drama more fun and reality it sends out a good message no evil shadows nothing plain simple story also to add to it the actors have done a tremendous job doing a 100 justice to their characters and the screenplay is perfectly presented love the soundtracks throughout the movie a perfect movie hence the 10 on 10 no matter how much ever you wish or try to change the power lies in the present and the genuine love that you get and share with your dear ones a true representation of love over power,happy
what a pleasant surprise this movie was when i saw this film advertised it went straight into the i would rather not pile this negative first reaction was because of how it was advertised it was advertised as a movie about boy loves a girl and the girl doesnt know he exists that movie youve seen a million times upon watching this film i was utterly astonished it could be so badly represented it was funny and poignant in a way that was honest it feels sincere like a handwritten letter there is so much more to this movie than just the clich if you take the time to watch this film you will not regret it its quirky but just enough it finds a lovely balance between comedy and drama it is not really about time travel its about life its about the important lessons everyone learns along the way each persons choices are unique as are the paths they take through life this film shows you one mans choices and the path he makes for himself,happy
i only give this 9 because of rachel mcadams she was good in it but i have just seen her too much of late the film was a real surprise  it was sentimental but it was never mawkish bill nighy was his usual reliable self and i enjoyed the main guys performance i forget his name i too fell in love with the actress who played charlotte  what a babe it was well written and plotted though there did seem to be one or two plot holes at times richard curtis seems to be still at the top of his game as a writer and now he directs with the same sure touch i had read poor reviews of this movie and avoided watching it for some time i have to ignore reviews in the future and make my own decision,happy
ive watched this film 4 times now and every time it gets better the writing is amazingly tight and it is an incredibly well put together film if you liked notting hill and love actually then you should not miss this one the premise seems a little goofy at first but if you let that distract you then youve missed the point its about life and love and what you can and cant do to make them better it also has some perfectly scripted jokes acting is superb all roundif it didnt quite work for you the first time i seriously suggest you watch it a couple more times there are very few movies that reward repeat viewings so well the underground montage the greatest wedding sequence ever and the final walk on the beach get me every time,happy
this movie is a must see it has everything for everyone both the main characters are absolutely brilliant this movie is by far the greatest love story ever about time makes your cry laugh and smile i mean this movie has to be good considering this is the first review i have ever written on a movie best movie of 2013 by far maybe even the best movie ever i have seen a lot of love stories but none that can compete with this one but i mean come on anything that is romantic that includes rachel mcadams is going to be good she makes you fall in love with her in every movie she makes besides mean girls i hated her and domhnall gleeson is just as amazing in this film as rachel they both make an absolutely adorable pair,happy
richard curtis most recent offering is on the face of it familiar ground it appears to be a romantic comedy about a charming middle class boy and the girl of his dreams but this time theres rather more to it than thatwhen tim turns 21 he learns that he has the power to travel in time but only back to moments within his own life he decides to use his ability to get himself a girlfriend which he does although he has to meet the girl of his dreams mary several times and they fall in nice middle class love this may seem like the usual curtis formula but it really isnt firstly the central relationship is not between tim domhnall gleeson and mary rachel mcadams its between tim and his father bill nighysecondly the film is about more than love its about family friends life choices consequences responsibility and several other themes and lovethirdly there is a depth a heart and a soul to this film that is rare in the genre it stays with you in a way that romantic comedies in my experience just dont everfinally there is a subtlety to the film that isnt present in curtis earlier work the mawkish depths that romantic comedies are rather prone to are largely avoided here which is quite an achievementthe excellent cast are well served by the sharpest and wittiest script that curtis has produced to date the bittersweet taste is present as expected but it doesnt define the film here the bittersweetness actually adds something to the films flavour to sum up this is richard curtis most mature effort so far ive enjoyed his earlier work  they were fine examples of romantic comedy about time is more than that its a fine example of a film,happy
there are few films that you instantly know will stay with you forever this is certainly one i have to confess that at times i found the upper middle class west country liberal setting a little troubling but maybe that says more about my own prejudices than anything else no mr curtis not all our lives are like that without this the movie would have scored a perfect 10 exquisite direction understated acting and a razor sharp script combine to leave the viewer feeling more alive than they have probably ever felt before this is what cinema is really about if as the credits roll at the end of this movie you do not feel moved and privileged to live in an age when art can be this good then something is wrong with your wiring do your soul a favour and watch this movieand then watch it again the next day just to savour the wonderful moments it contains,happy
it was about time to be taken to the magic of movie land without special effects but with real effects i feel that i need to talk to people with my heart about my heart but how wonderful it is to do it with your own kind better with you own blood i know what it is like because i think it is the most important thing in life you need to make the best possible effort because you do not have a second chance and its always too late if you need to repeat actions good times you live become a special time in space they float and become a little piece of paradise i know that the best way to influence in positive the world around you is to be true to yourself and make the best possible effort to be yourself with all your aspects positive and negative it is hard and not always perfect but imagine to like the outcome anyhow i really enjoyed the movie and think it is worth seeing and take it as it is,happy
no words enough to describe the feelings produced by this filmyes i see people talking about stereotypes and marketing tricks but i will have to say to all that one simple truth fact even its all about perspective not meant bad to anyone not meant good to others its just the way things are people are meant to be different and are also meant to experience things in different ways thats the true beauty of life anyway and its how i choose to experience thingsi dont usually write reviews there are other people out there can can do this so much better in any way possible than me but watching this made me write these things down and there arent many films that made me do this you may choose to read them you may choose to discard them and you know what that is also the beauty of life choiceone thing needed to say though people should evaluate movies a bit different because there isnt often enough we get to see quality in films this isnt the best movie out there no but it sure is one of the best in my humble opinion mainly for the fact it dangles with notions that most people care for and it does them in a creative joyful manner that exhumes respect to the viewer and travels us to good and bad places at the same time with a relaxing mannerloved the soundtrack and the cinematography but more even so i loved the way the story is being tolda must watch if you havent,happy
i like scifiction i read a little the plot of this movie thinking on the american movie the butterfly effect with ashton kutcher but i can tell you after really enjoying this movie that its far way better the time traveling thing is not the thing that does this movie extraordinary its the moments the characters live its about the beauty on seeing things completely different from today life we live especially in america were time seems like a luxury we are loosing the beauty of life and this movie is about seeing it embracing it just the way its be loved and love with all your heart all the persons that are important to you this movie will make you think in those who have a forever seat in your heartthanks for bring us this kind of movie,happy
well this movie certainly was a lot better than i expectedseeing the trailer i was amused at the idea of how the movie would pull of the time traveling plot not the most often used idea for a romcom but nonetheless an interesting choicethis movie definitely is not without its flaws there are some parts which lack attention to detail regarding the time travel part and sometimes you expect something and are left wondering where the movie will go next when things dont go as you expect them however it is a very enjoyable film with some exciting twists and a good moral about life just allow yourself to enjoy the story and enjoy what the movie has to offer and you will find yourself very satisfieddefinitely a good film to watch,happy
this film tells the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time he embarks on the mission to make his life perfect by finding a girlfriendthough the main character is a guy it still is a romantic film that is aimed at women the story is about finding happiness and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome its almost like the notebook plus the time travelers wife combined and as rachel mcadams is in all three theres much danger of her being typecast or cast only rachel in time travelling films or dont make the film back to the film itself i think its a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities his realisation at the end is quite good and it wasnt the ending i was expecting though there are many plot holes just like many other time travel stories its still an enjoyable film,happy
when i first saw this out at the cinema i thought it looked like a pretty rubbish film but on impulse today i decided to buy it and give it ago and i am so glad i did probably should mention that i am a complete sucker for types of films some might call mindnumbingly cutesy but i thought this was absolutely fantastic thoroughly impressed by the way the film kept my interest throughout its entirety with plenty of oh my moments made me cry like an absolute fool towards the end as i couldnt image how hard it must have been for him to have to make such tough decisions that you normally ok normally in a world where people time travel and all that wouldnt think youd ever have to make overall fantastic storyline great acting throughout the cast and a thoroughly enjoyable and heart wrenching film this is now on a par with the notebook for most tears shed whilst watching a film and will be one that i will more than likely watch time and time again if i ever fancy a good blubber,happy
yes i do have to say that i have thought about similar plots a lot of times i really love this movie as it is really aiming for my soft spots perhaps a couple of weak scenes but we have to look behind those moments and focus on the deeper meaning of it i got a couple of ahamoments during the play lovely and heartfelt connections between the actors also one of my favorite composers arvo prt is represented with his spiegel im spiegel and this alone moves the grades of the scale and for me well i dont do time travels anymore,happy
time travel is one of the more hitormiss story conceits in film its certain to get peoples attention but almost as certain to expose the film to a barrage of criticism related to logic and the butterfly effect in the hands of filmmaker richard curtis however todays finest purveyor of charming little films love actually pirate radio among other notable writing credits time travel gets personalwhereas so many movies use time travel for exploitative comedic purposes hot tub time machine about time more accurately represents what someone would actually use time travel for in their personal life time travel doesnt completely take hold of the story its simply the key player in main character tims domhnall gleeson quest for romancelike the best of us tim has a penchant for fudging things up the first time so when his father billy nighy reveals the men in their family can time travel to different points throughout their lifetime except the yetlived future he takes advantage of correcting a number of social missteps such as kissing a girl a new years eve party when the jaw dropping gorgeous charlotte margot robbie stays at their cornwall home for the summer tim soon learns that time travel only goes so far in swaying someones feelings he moves to london to pursue law in the fall where he endeavors to at last find a girlfriend and he meets mary rachel mcadams if it doesnt sound like about time has a compelling plot thats because it doesnt yet it doesnt suck either thats how brilliant a writer curtis is slapping dumblooking smiles and moviewatchers faces with clever dialogue humorous scenarios and compelling romance mcadams unquestionably one of the best the romance genre has ever seen runs away with this material which she simply couldnt do in films such as quite appropriately the time travelers wife gleeson also fits perfectly with curtis style hes humorous awkward and charming all at the same timeunlike many who watch this film will be lead to believe the movie is not about tims pursuit of mary its not a twohour version of the sequence in groundhog day in which bill murrays phil connors attempts to use time travel to perfectly woo andie macdowells rita through a series of corrected screwups the narrative scope of about time is much larger in terms of chronology spanning the entirety of tims young adulthood in fact three quarters of the way in its not even about tim and marys romance at alleventually about time becomes about the challenges of living life enduring the bad and appreciating the good and what the ability to time travel would really teach us about living day to day and treasuring the present an expected theme and conclusion indeed but this final section gets a little long and tiresome without any riveting conflict still curtis has crafted characters we connect with strongly enough to hold up this last leg of his filmall that said its easy to poke holes in the logic of the time travel in about time but the concept makes enough sense that its not too distracting and you can still enjoy the characters the romance and the lessons learned curtis might not be one of the greatest filmmakers working but he understands what it takes to elevate a romantic comedy from the rest of the cheesy pack and that takes tremendous skillsteven cthanks for reading visit moviemusereviewscom for more,happy
i usually dont write reviews but i noticed some persons bashing this movie this movie is not perfect non is but ill tell you what it is 1 its funny it has lots of moments that you can identify to embarrassing moments the troubles of being rejected its been shown in such a way that you can see the silliness of it all i guess one of the many lessons in this movie is to learn to laugh at ourselves 2 it has tear inducing drama how sometimes we cant let go of those we love how to cope with family issues how love and acceptance are key factors in our relationship with our partners and family how big is the love for our children3 it has a great story line with the time travel the actors make this movie so believable you even believe they can actually do it this part to me was of self discovery learning to appreciate life the little things our family our friends that we have the control to make our days better just by being grateful and see the beauty in everything all in all this is a movie thatll leave you thinking for days after seeing it and if you do see it take it for what it is bask in it put yourself in their places and youll thoroughly enjoy it in the end all you have to ask yourself is what would you do if you could go back in time,happy
just watched this and im a literally blown away totally british and typically richard curtis a fantastic piece of british and american cinema working harmoniously together brilliant screenplay and extremely realistic of course not the time travel it has made me rethink everything i do and makes me look forward to life yes a lot to say for just a film but only films like this can trigger such a response well done mr curtis and well done for making me think the way in which he takes everyday scenarios and wishes and turns the age old phrase if only i could turn back time into a reality makes this film what it is it offers new ways round situations you may find yourself in and offers alternative routes to lifes big decisions like having a baby or getting married i have never thought so much about life after watching this film and i have to say i am not an easyily manipulatable person but this film has changed my outlook on the little things in life and how they can just disappear instantly i can only expect good responses for this film as cinematically it ticked all the right boxes,happy
the first word that comes to mind when wanting to describe this is sweet for it offers an unpretentious endearing and despite its supernatural element a candid picture on family and romance if we truly set aside cynicism and fear and let ourselves embrace the magic in normality we can understand and adore this lovely recount of a young mans family life the development of relationships between the different characters is at the core of this story from the bond between father and son mother and father boyfriend and girlfriend siblings friends much is said about how these connections can deepen if the people involved are simply nice to each other altruistically sincere and cheerful the actors play their part pleasantly the soundtrack is spot on and there are some very good dialoguesi think there is a lesson to the story and it reminds me of niehburs prayer god give me grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed courage to change the things which should be changed and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the othersome things are in our power to change and if our desire is strong enough and our mind creative and open we will sooner or later make it happen and when such a promise to ones self is kept it feels like the planets have aligned and everything goes the way it supposed to there are often times however when things are not in our power to change whatever we do as much as we try to postpone influence stop a misfortune from occurring life takes its natural course unimpressed the key to life is living it simple,happy
this a nice movie i loved it because it had meaning i welcome every movie of the sortit has some goofs sure like the time traveling thing is not very well explained 1st after he travels in time does he live every day again or just does what he wants to do and then and comes back at the present the part when he goes with his sister and suddenly comes back with things changed huh goes with the sister with hands together but then with his father he doesnt need to and is that their moment or just his fathers he cant go back past the birth confusing and i guess not throughly though unless someone can explain me these situations would appreciate it it is not a true story just a fantasy like romantic movie where everything looks perfect and going well the objective is to send a message and it does in a sense although i think it couldve been better it not a bad try on the contrary a great one so leave your critic thoughts and go for this journey openly accept it and appreciate it its simple on a whole i loved it and i recommend it to everyone who is into meaningful movies really special it can touch anyone simple beautiful ohh and nice songs peacefull,happy
about time is a film directed by richard curtis and stars domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams and bill nighy the story centres around gleesons character tim who at the age of 21 is told by his father that all men in their family can travel back in time instead of looking for knowledge or wealth with his new found power he uses it to advance his pretty well abysmal love life now like so many i had next to no info on what this was about i had time travel love story certainly not sappy and for me that sounded pretty good when i sat down to watch this though i didnt expect to love it as much as i did this film really captured me from the word go with its hilarious script and fantastic main actor and im not ashamed of saying it the performances are all topnotch domhnall gleeson works his role perfectly as a shy but charming young british man hes ridiculously relatable and his character feels incredibly genuine rachel mcadams also gives a stellar performance and she is really adorable in this film call me strange or whatnot i dont care because i found her incredibly cute the rest of the ensemble is wonderful with special mentions to bill nighy who plays dad and gives a very emotional performance and tom hollander who gives an absolutely hilarious performance as harry a writer who is incredibly selfcentred all in all wonderful film on the performance levelthis is certainly not your average romcom in which you can predict every aspect possible it makes some twists and turns which you certainly cant see coming and ultimately the route it takes is a route not commonly seen in romantic films curtis doesnt try to clog up the film with tremendously silly clichd issues within the relationship as so many romantic films do it just takes you on a ride that so many relationships undertake ultimately it feels like a real relationship except this time with time travel and whilst im on the topic of time travel i believe they used that aspect incredibly well they didnt use it at every opportunity possible and in a nice twist the actually used time travel for teaching us lessons to accept everyday as it comes to anticipate the next and to not live in the past ultimately on a sentimental level about time delivers a lotin conclusion about time is by far one of the best movies ive ever seen period its free flowing smart and incredibly charming and it begs for repeat viewings richard curtis has nailed it out of the park here and im sure ill be raving about this film all into the future1010,happy
very inviting witty charming and overall excellentabout time caters to all audience and that fact alone is very hard to find in films nowadays the element of the film showing that this is going to be your typical romcom while you are glued to your screens and when you are just about ready to accept that this is your all is well that ends well romcom it punches you in the face and you find yourself drenched in tears and having a hard time inhaling through your nosethe limited foreshadowing of the plottwist has became an essential part of the film to its success and beauty it is the trait that all moviegoers are very hungry to see the i did not see that coming at all moment when you are inside a theater or on your living room was perfectly delivered by the film it is obvious that this has been a product of a long and painstaking task of developing a story that will not only attract people because of the trailer that they will see inbetween other movies but the audience will be lured by other people saying and telling them how good it was and by the reviews it receivedrichard curtis and company has picked the right set of talents to go with the wonderful story about time has to offer the viewers it brought justice to its rich and flavorful storyline by partnering it with an ensemble of roleperfect actorsit is the true manifestation of something beautiful will only come once in a whilebravo 1010,happy
everyone can be a teachereven a moviea movie as such which teaches you lessons about life always have a special over here on the left side the movie shows the perfect use of timetravel without tons of machinery so it leaves the viewer who aint that good in science happy who wishes he could do the sameand people in their 20s add this to your kart to help plan your liferachel mcadams is always a treat in such kind of movies she doesnt pull out a notebook but gives just what the script asked from her gleeson might be too orange to have a huge female fan base but he more than makes up for it with his performancehe and bill nighy shows how an ideal fatherson relationship should be like the script was so beautiful that it quickly got rid of the usual absurdity of a time travel movie also what it does best is give relevance to even the smallest of characters when youll finish watching no one will seem irrelevant a movie with no hype no expectations which is why it does so wellitll surely leave a smile on your face when youre over with it,happy
first of all i want say that i really enjoyed this movie ever since i saw the movie love actually it is always a treat to see bill nighy and i have to say he really brings this movie up a notch many people who dont like this movie give it a lot of critic for it not giving a lot of explanation and complexity with the time travel aspect of the movie however this was never the point this is a simple fun romantic movie full with emotions if your expecting plot twists and complex story lines go watch the mementos or inceptions about time is a movie which aims to show how beautiful life is and how we should take advantage of every day the acting in this movie i also thought was great i had never seennoticed the lead actor domhnall gleeson but thought he was great a perfect likable awkward british type of actor and the relationships made through out the movie are so believable not the unrealistic moments you find in many hollywood movies all in all i really recommend to go watch this movie no it wont win any oscars this is just a good fun loving movie as it was intended,happy
a review by greg craddockthis is the latest film by richard curtis so you know from a daily life living perspective pretty much what youre going to get for me it definitely had too much of a groundhog day feeling to it where if you mess up you can go back  start again you definitely get the feeling that at the preproduction meeting someone asked for someone that sounds just like hugh grant because domhnall how is that pronounced gleeson sounds just like him however this is quite a good film and the cast are great who cant like bill nighy with an excellent performance from rachel mcadams too its a richard curtis film it does exactly what it says on the tin,happy
tim lives an ordinary and happy life with his odd family until his 21st birthday when his father reveals to him that all the male descendants of the family are able to travel back in time through the events of their own time line tim will use this unexpected power to find the right girl with whom to spend the rest of his life about time has positively surprised me basically unknown in italy i admit that ive seen it just because ive read that there were time travels in the plot but by the appearance of tims weird family i understood that i would have loved this movie the rectangular busy unsentimental mother the always available father the free spirit sister the impeccable uncle desmond arent so different from the relatives i use to know very well the meeting and the life with mary are maybe too perfect to seem real yeah i know if you leave out the time travel thing but fit in with the rest of the story the last part of the movie was very touching the farewell to tims father the advices for a happy life and the walk on the beach sure one of many for them the very last glance at the past before move on with life it is everyones dream to own the ability to travel through time to go back and fix all those little or big imperfections of our lives that create embarrassment when you think about them even after many years and lets face it we dont like tim at first because of his ability that makes his life perfect while we mere mortals have to do the long way without ever being able to see the consequences of our actions but in the end we realize as well as tim that we dont need to go back in time to be happy but we have to live each day by focusing our attention on the good things rather than on those that went wrong by remembering the good times and giving the right perspective to the bad ones,happy
the welding of a concept of timetravel to a romcomwellthatis indeed really unexpectedtime travel and romcom are in the two opposite sides of the moviegenre spectrum and richard curtis does a quite impeccable job of bringing them togetherand wellthe end result is magnificentthe moviealthough is a romantic comedyexplores the relationship of a father with his sonthe central theme of the story is thattim hallthe protagonist of the filminherits the ability to travel back in time from his fatherand how he uses it to his advantagealthough the movie is a different take on love storiesits like what a good love story should beie funny and interestingthe movie showcases the trials and tribulations of timright from 21 years of age till he has his fourth childoveralltim hall leads a near perfect lifebarring a few momentshaving said thatwellthe cons arethe movie gets a bit too dragged at timesand could have been shortened a bitalsothe movie is a little bit too happybut thats expectedsincethe protagonist uses his gift very well to his advantageto an extenthe cant the performances are beautifulespecially from bill nighy as for richard curtisin my opinioni still feel his directorial debutthe love anthology filmlove actually better than this oneto conclude this is a adorablefun movieone that is betterwhen watched with a loved one,happy
this movie shouldnt just be sought of as a science fiction flick its the depiction of your daily life the casting is really good especially to rachel mcadams marywhere you unknowingly fall in love with her its a superbly executed direction and there are times when you feel its all predictable but you are wrong this takes you on an overwhelming ride where you are curious about each incident that occur to tim domhnall gleeson whether hes going to actually use his power or not this movie connects to all of us telling what to look for to keep you happy in life whether you want to be selfish about you happy thing or not to be happy and help others to be happy sacrificing yours the movie is enjoyable and there are instances in this movie that you could use it in you daily lifethis is not the regular family movie where you will hear soft talks and see a lot of emotions yeah its different may be there a lot of movies out there like this about time travel and all but this one in particular doesnt try to spoil the fun of time travel and infact mix it up with love and family i have never been a fan of romantic movies but this one has my attention for its originality that it preserves throughout the film it can be easily related to all well the rest is up to you to decide whether this movie leave you in an awe about life if it didnt watch it again,happy
before i start this review that i would like to point out that almost all of the negative reviews on this page are written by people who hate most or all richard curtis films now everyone is entitled to their own opinion but if you hate those types of films why watch it do you have nothing else to do other than insult a film you assume that you will hate from the start and then give it a highly unnecessarily bad review of a film you have probably barely watched but thats not why im writing this this review is being written because i think that about time is one of the funniest most moving films i have ever seen and believe me ive seen a lot the plot or as the slaughters would call the lack of is about an ordinary middle class man who at a new years eve party finds out that his family has the power to travel back in time the film then shows the lovable main character find a girl and have a relationship etc i wont go into details for the sake of ruining the film but it is very sweet i like the thoughtprovoking plot i enjoyed most of curtis script and thought that all but bill nighy were excellent my reason for picking of nighy is because he is one of my favourite actors but his part was full of obvious awkward dialogue that didnt really suit him although he still made me laugh on more than one occasion all in all despite the fact that most people who dislike most of richard curtiss films will not like this about time is a great film which should make the audience laugh cry and be merry,happy
with comedic timing and sad moments portrayed through excellent direction it is hard pressed for any honest reviewer to find fault in this filmother than the simple fact that i as a viewer was not part of this truly fantastic scripti could only find fault in the scripted play on physics and temporal mechanics try as i might i found that a darkened closet clenched fists did little for me that i was in fact not transported to my past and felt massively misled by the writers is of null effect nothing had or will change great movie i did however ask my dad if there was anything he would like to tell me he gave me a look and shook his headoh well anyway acting is brilliant script well paced and complete direction and lens are targeted and specific in regard to story really hard to find flaws in production or otherwise bring your heart to the venue very very enjoyable movie,happy
to startany film with the gorgeous rachel mcadams is on to a winner i initially thought curtis doing a scifi and was a bit worried this might distract from the storyhowever the time travel was simple no computer generated graphics or anything fancy like that but it worked well and didnt detract from the story line at allits one of those films that has some great comedy but also has some lovely heart felt partsespecially when tim goes back to see his dad 1 last time this had me in tearsa lovely story with a lovely endingreally gives you perspective at your own life and to make the most of each day as it comes1010,happy
this movie is definitely something elsewhen i first saw the cover photo take a look at it i thought it was going to be another cheap romance movie but was i wrong the movie tells a story of a time traveler but much unlike the idea is conveyed in other movies although marked a scifi movie it takes the element of fiction from a philosophical point of view as opposed to others which strain your brain by trying to merge fiction with laws of nature theres a line in the movie that sums this up perfectly strange and what about the whole butterfly effect thing what can i say we dont seem to have messed up civilization yet its simple you travel back change the present moment voil they just dont care about the scientific aspect which is a rather positive surpriseon to the philosophical nature of the movie tim the main character is constantly bothered with series of questions do i go back in time should i change what just happened do i save my sister and lose my child or just let her run the course of recovery on her own its an ongoing battle of thoughts provocative thoughts at the very leastas for the actors rachel mcadams makes for a perfect fit i dare say this role suited her even better than the one in the notebook domhnall gleeson played out the average chump perfectly without all the stereotypical facial expression exaggerationsto sum it all up ive seen many movies but ive only now registered at imdb with sole purpose to write this review one of the best movies ive seen hands down,happy
the film lasts around two hours and maybe the first part of it is more like a romantic comedy and the second part is a bit more emotive all mixed with the idea of travelling in timethe first part is similar to notting hill boy meet girl with funny situations and good dialogues the main characters rachel mcadams domhnall gleesonare charming the whole filmthe second part is a bit more dramatic but with a positive message this is the lifethe film turned out to be an enjoyable movie and have enough tension to keep it interesting,happy
this is a great example of a movie without real drama or rather without melodrama i cant quite fit it into any genre because everything is so understated the acting the plot etc everything has a sort of dulled real life flow to it theres no emotional outbursts no unbelievable comic mishaps with maybe one or two exceptions and no real clear ending to the story its like were just watching some guy live out some of his life and like real life not a heck of a lot actually happens in a movie sense anyway but thats not necessarily a bad thing the movies strength is in its characters i loved the main character and just about all the supporting characters are enjoyable they all have a sort of level headedness that is usually omitted for the sake of moviedrama but therein lies my disappointment with the film with such a great premise i wonder why they decided to play it down rather than up the hook was seemingly made to be an allout comedy with the ability to undo your mistakes or actions why not let the characters go to extremes the events of the movie and the characters use of his power remain frustratingly lowkey this film is less groundhog day and more love actually and thats fine i love love actually but if thats the movie youre going to make why give your character a superpower the gimmick is never exploited to its full potential and despite a smooth script and lovable characters i was left a little disappointed,happy
i watched this movie at the cinema after many recommendations of my friends on their facebook i was trying to keep my brain like a blank paper stay away from all information about this movie before watching that just need to know that is must watching movie is all enough to be honest after 60 minutes watching i talked to myself oh my god i wasted 60 minutes of my life to watch bullshit love story but after that i dont remember exactly when maybe after the main actor getting marry i could not take my mind off the movie it was very touching at the resti dont like the very first 60 minutes but the rest of the movie was good because i love watching movie about the love of people in a family which is not the hottest or controversial topic but tender and touching its really impressive to watch the man argued himself his new born baby or more times with his father finally he had to obey the rule of nature let his father go away but all beautiful moment of him still keeping in the bottom of his heart its not new  similar ingredient but still good enough to keep you staying to watch till the last scene i love the message of this movie enjoy every single moment of your life  its quite simple but it seems we always forget that all of us is meritorious to love and loved,happy
about time 12a director richard curtis starring rachel mcadams bill nighy domhnall gleeson and tom hollander rated 12a for containing infrequent strong language and moderate sex references running time 123 minutes out now in uk cinemastim domhnall gleeson is not having any luck with the ladies on the day of his 21st birthday tims luck finally changes for the better when his dad bill nighy explains to tim that all the men in his family are able to travel in time bewildered tim decides to use this newfound gift in order to find the girl of his dreams having directed his third feature film including about time richard curtis has established himself as the perfect man to write a romantic comedy from bumbling men hugh grant to a wickedly funny priest rowan atkinsoncurtis is never unable to create iconic characters his last effort the boat that rocked was shallow to say the least it seemed as though curtis had started with a great idea cast and soundtrack but lost something along the way the script perhapsanyway about time is by no means a disappointment it really is a warm welcome back to the genre curtis has helped to perfect out of all the romantic comedies available about time is the one that i would gladly watch again there have been so many terrible comedies lately its hard to find one which is adequate for viewing but about time is near perfectthe performances from the whole cast are fantastic with a particularly funny yet sarcastic character named harry tom hollander domhnall gleeson is terrific and proves he is one of best young actors on our screens today rachel mcadams acts well but doesnt seem to bring much flair to her characterthe film also explores the time travel genre with fun and quirky quips but also poses questions to the audience which prove to be interesting it goes without saying that curtis can almost definitely write a good script when given time to mature and that he has doneverdictabout time is a joy to behold teaching but never preaching the film delivers a decent message about enjoying life to the full cleansed in clean jokes and interesting characters dont miss it unless you can travel back in time7 stars out of 10,happy
to pick apart this film would be far too cruel because its innocence has left most with a skip in their step and tear in their eye behind the extremely long duration it was a sweet picture that expressed itself well and took audiences through the rewarding story of tims domhnall gleeson life after the discovery of his fathers bill nighy secret that the men in the family could travel in time it featured warming performances from bill nighy rachel mcadams and domhnall gleeson creating relatable characters and making an unbelievable story bittersweet the comedy was both written and presented well by richard curtis despite been more melancholy than his previous work it made an excellent caricature of a nervous romance and was in places really funny being labelled as a romantic comedy one would believe about time is a story of boy means girl which is true at the start but it develops more harmony throughout different relationships were explored and as each developed the film developed a broader more universal meaning even though it was a feel good portrait it also felt very safe over explanatory and slow not making it lose its essence but causing glances to watch now and again definitely worth the watch but as films go it could have been much better,happy
without doubt one of the worst films i have ever seen storyline  banal bordering on silly every character totally miscast please richard quit while youre ahead and spare us anymore of this twaddle i loved four weddings and notting hill we watch love actually every christmas doom all gleeson is not hugh grant  struggling to grasp the concept that this guy is actually a professional actor has to be related to someone close to richard curtis honestly a caterpillars hips have more talent and charisma if you want to watch a film about time travel i recommend any of the narnia films this is sad insipid nonsense about people who dont inhabit this planet in any shape or form finally in your next film why not just call bill nighy  bill nighy he is incapable of playing anybody but himself avoid this movie at all costs so ive clenched my fists in a dark room and gone back in time to edit this review dohmnall gleeson is the son of brendan gleeson established actor etc that explains all hes actor because his dad is difference  his dad is but he aint white middleclass tosh with nepotism thrown in for good measure,happy
there is a feeling one gets when watching a richard curtis film the warmth starts from your middle and then spreads out gradually to the tips of your fingers and toes these stories are cinematic chicken soup for soul its that involuntary aah that escapes whilst clutching a hot mug as wesley morris puts it fine class dining it is not merely a few ingredients tossed into a bubbling broth but what could be better on a chilly friday night four weddings and a funeral and notting hill made us believe we could slide right into the gang or that we were laughing along right there at the thacker dinner table another etching into their modest working class tapestry his directorial debut love actually doubled down on this ensemble approach beating audiences into submission with schmaltzy sentimentalism and isnt that what christmas movies are for if youre going to commit you might as well go all in roll that montageabout time isnt about any ordinary british family but its endearing enough that it almost could be the lakes live by seaside in cornwall an idyllic childhood peppered with tea parties on the beach and projected films in the garden by moonlight and rain their umbrellas unfurled in a wes andersonesque tableau the wellmeaning uncle desmond is the films sounding board for the level of affection that connects them a lifesized teddy bear who offers warm words when you squeeze his palm kit kat is the only misstep here shes everything youd ever want in a sister but shes not real every pixie skip and tacklehug straining the realms of authenticity and the wonderful bill nighy is the heart of it all able to distill philosophical tenets that might sound heavy or onthenose when spoken by others into bitesized wisdom that can be offered over a game of ping pong hes so grounded in his presence that he never lets the film get lost in its tweeis that too strong of a word about time is not shy about its quaintness but leans into it gently and invites the audience to pull up a chair the lakes are well off but the phrase rich would never drift into your mind during your viewing the wedding could have been an extravagant affair yet curtis introduces a torrent of rain to wash away any pretense or fanciful notions and in the end the speeches take place in a cramped little tea room with the guests crouching or standing or squashed next to each other on sofas or folding chairs all a bit damp it would be hard to see americans be this selfdeprecatory or not play it for laughs and theres never ever a thought of jumping back in time for a redothis is low key scifi at its best the time travel element almost accepted as simply magical realism that this mechanic is never quite properly explained may irk some more hardcore fans but i think its beside the point ive spoken before about curtis little touches but they are worth a mention here a style so light and soft that you feel welcome immediately his cinematography is cozy personified shallow focus and warm diffused light tracking the pair through the streets of london as if they were the only two people alive in the city that night the universe still as they fall for each other this is the meet cute at its optimal cuteness with the preceding dialogue on their literal blind date a textbook on how to write dialogue for said meet cute hitting all the right areas some humour to lighten things up a smattering of selfdeprecation and just the right amount of chemistry see how mary emerges from the restaurant and reveals herself to tim for the first time stumbling slightly on the step backlit as if a halo hovers over her head and a hint of smile framed by a fringe i bought it at once no amount of time travel could make charlotte love him but for mary it was just a matter of time,happy
the movie was just a complete version of what i wanted to watch the cinematography plotstory characters dialogues directions etc everything was amazing the last scenes of the movie made me emotional and one thing i learnt  realized after watching movie was that spend maximum time with your parentsfamily members because they arent gonna stay there with you forever more love to the world good bye and my warmest regards,happy
i just loved this movie perfect chatching and adorabel made me cry a bit must see again one of my favorite mobiles that is for suredont understand the low ratings its a great movie,happy
because each time i watch it i im a blubbering wreck totally immersed in the belief of love kindness and wanting to make the world a better place richard curtis really gets people  with their ordinaryness flaws and capacity to love he draws rich characterisation from the story of tim following the male family footsteps of time travel youd think it a preposterous storyline but its given great heart and sentiment all the actors are wonderful but a special mention for the understated joy of bill nighy as tims dad  their relationship has me in tears each time i watch theres plenty of laughs too as tim attempts to woo mary  in my book this is richard curtiss finest hour  a must see ,happy
i generally find romantic films to be drab uninteresting and ultimately unrealistic this film forms a brilliant and moving exception really the movie doesnt completely center around the romance between the tim and mary played by domnhall gleeson and rachel mcadams respectively the films main focus by the end of the film is on a more abstract message and broad theme which simply highlights the importance of enjoying life while you have it tims relationship with his father serves as an equally important relationship throughout the film and it is through this relationship that the movies central message is conveyed the ability of the men in tims family to travel back in time is handled quite well and is used as a mechanic to advance the plot and supplement it rather than dictate and hold it back ultimately what i thought was going to be a simple romance film with a unique scifiesque twist on it with the guy getting the girl in the end turned into an incredibly unique film with its own fresh plot structure and critically important message live each day as if it is your last cherish every moment it is all we have,happy
the time travel conceit is fun  used in plenty of effectively cute ways but theres so much more to this film that makes it truly great the genuine humor  goodnatured characters are wonderful ways into the movie allowing you to soak in the story but by the end you realize that youve watched a stunning example of the peace  wisdom that can only come with the passing of time  the immeasurable beauty that only exists in the second half of life,happy
assuming youre a fan and assuming therefore that you for example regard love actually as overall the greatest romantic comedy ever made i do then youre going to go into this 6yearold movie happy to find another piece of ultrabritish work from writerdirector richard curtis and from the off youre going to be happy to find  once again with curtis  a diverse collection of great british music in there and scenes of an incredibly photogenic and sympathetic london as well as a simplygorgeous cornwall how blessed might a country be to boast both within its borders as separated by a journey of 4 or 5 hoursmost likely a typical viewer will also find the corepairing here of canadian rachel mcadams and irishman domhnall gleeson as mary and tim pretty irresistible and be more than content to find a supporting cast including both bill nighy as tims dad and tom hollander with a very creditable lydia wilson as tims sister and with small parts for margot robbie tom hughes and even richard griffiths and richard e grantmore dubious is the complication of the basic love story with an ability of tims shared with his dad to time travel and here we see done less well and less convincingly what was done very well indeed if darkly and scarily in the butterfly effect or else to massive comedic and feelgood efect in back to the future tims dad tells him there are certain rules that come with this ability yet every analyst online ive seen believes these rules are flouted in various ways and that was absolutely also my conclusionwhether a film can survive that would seem a good question but of course this movie doesits not without its gravitas as tim does indeed resemble the ashton kutcher part in butterfly in having to make some difficult choices as he strives to use his gift to make things better or put them right in semigodlike fashion however while all may be fair in love and war tims desire to successfully improve his first time with mary is not a matter of life and death and is as some reviewers have wisely noted a kind of sexual exploitation of a beloved partner in which  admittedly  she benefits by getting a better version of the coitus each time but is only aware of one the final time  while he basically has a repeat randy sex and lust fest with the girl he does genuinely love but also clearly lusts after its dubious to say the leastindeed this huge and potentially very serious part of tims life is kept entirely secret from mary throughout the tale  an unustainable situation especially in a marriage and life that purports to be as close as theirs is ironically tims sister does learn his secret which makes what is  in a sense  perpetrated against mary look even worsefairly obviously about time still has enough going for it to satisfy most viewers and to leave a mostly warm feeling however any deeper analysis will leave the piece looking a bit threadbare a pity in that sense so its more a 75 than an 8 but ok,happy

despite being a huge fan of timetravel films i let this one languish in my proverbial unwatched pile for quite some time it looked a bit nicholas sparksian for me if you catch my drift upon a recommendation however i finally decided to give it a try while not necessarily a perfect film it was a very enjoyable one that ran the gamut of my emotions the entire wayfor a basic plot summary this film tells the story of tim domhnall gleeson who shortly after his 21st birthday is told by his dad bill nighy that all the men in the family have a special skill the ability to travel backwards in time initially skeptical tim soon discovers this to be the truth after a serendipitous encounter with mary rachel mcadams who later becomes his wife and mother of his children tim lives his life using that time travel power both for good and for illso many timetravel films get caught up by either trying to explain the ins and outs of the process a fools errand or having the entire movie centered upon that one point in about time a different approach is taken and one that comes off as refreshing see about time really isnt a time travel movie at all it is a pretty traditional love story in all honest only using the hook of time travel to build its basic structurethat is truly where the strength of the picture lies the simple character moments that all good romance films possess the chemistry between gleeson and mcadams is special and just the entire universe they are living in is very relatable these are character types and situations that almost anyone can relate to with of course that pesky little time travel detail cropping up and either all the right or wrong timesmy only complaint about this movie i believe that slightly better direction might have produced a bit more coherent of an ending though i saw exactly what it was going for in terms of theme it feels very abrupt and not necessarily earned not bad just more a sense of i wish these specific themes would have been touched on more throughout the filmoverall though perhaps the greatest compliment i can give about time is how many different audiences it could appeal too adolescents or the elderly men or women film novices or seasoned cinephiles there are so many potential audiences for the movie because it touches on so many different themes in the end it is a wonderfully unique combination of science fiction romance and human drama,happy
thanks netflix for adding this movie i have seen this before but as soon as i see this in netflix i cant wait on seeing it again the time travelling plot is absurd but on how the lead character used it is all based on love,happy
about time takes a simple life lesson live every day of your life to the fullest and creates a wonderful love story that explores this message expands it and makes you reconsider the truly important things in life this is not only a romatic love story but it is a familial love story and a selflove story domnhall gleesons character takes us through a touching journey of insecurity determination and selfrealization the film is shot in a very simplistic manner that makes the audience feel like they are in the streets of london as the two main characters fall in love right next to them,happy
a wonderful romantic movie a brief guide for those who occasionally want to relive one special day from the past this is how modern movies should look the bittersweet fruits of cinema with real life heroes we meet every day and not with some fictitious marvel heroes this is a work of art poetic magical both sad and happy  like life itself,happy
you wont regret it my review is too short so i wanna let you know that i dont wanna write more just watch it ,happy
i was quite enchanted throughout the movie with the plot characters and particularly the atmosphere,happy
ive been avoiding this movie for a while for female i hate chick flicks im more of a die hard kind of girl and i netflix the icon definitely look like a chick flick but i went ahead and pulled up the description and it sounded pretty good actually about time travel and bill nighy was in the cast so i figured it must be a comedy and i truly needed something to make me laugh right now my health is failing and i have a lot of stress at home with my son graduating high school and turning 18 so i thought what the heck ill give it a chance and boy did i bet on the right horsethe first thing was i couldnt quiet place this ginger kid but there was something so special and magnetic about him so i had to come to imdb to look it up and it was definitely an epic facepalm how could i not know that i was sitting here watching a gleason and not just any gleason but the one who made my toes curl when he played bill weasley in the harry potter franchise and i kind of thought that the female lead looked a little familiar but she was so mousy that i didnt figure she was anybody id seen that i would try to store in my memory banks but as time went by they made her look better and better and i realized it was rachel mcadams for goodness sakes the actress from another one of my absolute favorite movies so this cast is full of starstudded actors and actresses now weve got that down we can move on loli do not like spoilers myself when i read these so i will guarantee you that im not going to give you more than a trailer or what a reviewer would give you so if youre looking for that im really sorry im sure somebody else in here well give that to you but i want you to enjoy it and appreciate it for yourself but what i will give you is some background and enough to make you really want to watch this movie this is about a young man whos been raised to be an absolute gentleman and that is what he is he lives on his familys beachfront property with mom dad sister an uncle whos a little bit off his rocker that is an absolute sweetheart one day his dad takes him aside and tells him that the men in his family can travel through time not forward but backwards they can go back and change minor things not like the history of war but like what shirt they wore to work yesterday and doing little things like that they can affect certain outcomes in their lives hes never had a love and one summer his sister brings up a friend and he really really likes her and the last day before she leaves she finally gets up the nerve to tell her and she tells him its too bad you waited till the last minute basically because i liked you too so he goes back in time and tells her earlier feeling confident because of what she told him and she tells him well why dont we see where this summer goes and you asked me on my last day so shes giving him all kinds of mixed messages and treating him pretty awful when she leaves so does he he begins his career in a law firm and immediately and awkward young man befriends him and we find that through the years our hero helps to make this awkward young man less awkward and the awkward young mans friendship helps our hero come out of his shell but one night they go to a restaurant where you eat in the dark they are seated with two female friends they actually hit it off and agreed to meet outside of the restaurant and the minute that our hero sees the woman hes been chatting with and feeding strawberry dessert to all thoughts of his previous summer crush are wiped from his head shes selfconscious and cant believe that hes interested in her but he asks for her number and she gives it to him he goes away so happy but when he gets home he finds out that his roommate who is an old friend of his fathers had his show  hes a playwright  completely tanked because the lead male actor forgot his lines so our hero being the complete gentleman that he is uses his time shifting abilities to go back in time 2 fix things and only finds that by making sure that that gentleman remembers his lines the males that hes playing opposing to then forgets his lines so he has to shift through time again and ends up holding scrip cards for that guy so he can read the script and the show ends up being a huge success but when he goes to call mary the girl he met her phone number is completely gone from his phone this is where im going to end it because i dont want to give anything away i think its important for you to watch and see what happens obviously hes going to use this time shifting abilities to find her because he had nothing other than her phone number to go on in the fact that she loves kate moss his sister and his friends help thats what happens when youre a good person people want to see you happy because they love you and in the end thats what this movie was about with love and being surrounded by good people i seldom go away feeling really good after watching a movie sure ive gone away laughing from watching a movie like ghostbusters and ive gone away quoting a movie like friday and ive gone away starryeyed from watching a movie like the notebook but this movie made me feel really good about life in the people that i have in my lifeso im to my typical positive and negative section it is on rare occasion that i ever give out a 10 star rating and that is because it is on rare occasion that a movie actually deserves a 10 star rating this movie suckered me in with beautiful cinematography a moving family dynamic you could feel the love especially when he started disparaging his mother because you could tell it was all jokingly in a loving manner and the use of such brilliant colors it really just made everything pop and really brought a feeling of happiness and positivity to the good times in the film the dynamic between our hero and our heroin was just amazing you can tell that these two are amazing actors because you could almost testify that they were in love the script was amazing the acting was amazing every single person in this did their best and you could feel itnow on to the negatives and obviously there cant be too many for me to have given it a 10 and obviously the negatives cant be that negative in order to keep that 10 there is an issue with his sister that has to be overcome and its a pretty big really dangerous issue i dont think the way it was handled was handled with appropriate severity and sensitivity to the issue there is one other thing but unlike how i could dance around the above thing i cant dance around this so im going to have to let it go lolall in all this was an absolutely amazing movie it should definitely be viewed by anyone whos looking to feel good about their day themselves the situation they find themselves in or just anything in general its just a feelgood movie dont waste your time himming and hawing its about time to watch this movie,happy
about time is exactly the role id expect rachel mcadams to take up the plot is interesting it allows for funny interesting and complex situations the setting is nice and very casual the cinematography is very artsy and it fits well with the acting and general pacing of the film i would call about time a sweet romance the concept of time travel in a romance seems at a glance as if it would diminish the intimacy and humor of such a beautiful genre of movies time travel in this situation is used to create a romance like other romances but it doesnt feel like just another romcom it feels new the concept is also simple and easy for anyone to grasp with ease the only movie ive seen bill nighy really fit in,happy
i mustve seen this movie nine or ten times and it still makes me cry my eyes out my wife cries to it my parents cry its just beautiful,happy
this is my first review im writing i cant resist myself to let the world know about this masterpiece i recently lost my father and i am not a person who shows feelings outside much i was crying for the whole time some of them are happy someof them are opposite to that such movies makes you feel how good is our human life and how to make most out of it everyone will change their perspectives of life after watching this movie thank you director for giving such an awsome movie,happy
a perfect movie ive said that twice this past week as ive revisited some of my favourites films this is more than a love story about blossoming love domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams there are a wide variety of love stories in this not the least of which is that of a father and his son bill nighy and domhnall lovely supporting cast great performances beautiful and textured writing exceptional music life affirming moments and profound words side by side with the humour of life ive watched this many times and even accidently bought two digital copies i give this film a 10 perfect out of 10 unconventional drama about love as a matter of fact i think ill watch it again right now,happy
i simply never get tried of this superb film that makes you happy and sad at the same time heartwarming,happy
i first saw this in the theater 5 or 6 years ago and have probably seen it 15 times since it is charming loving and sentimental in the absolute best sense of the words tim domnhall gleeson is raised by his bookloving dad artsy mom and daft uncle desmond with his sprite of a sister kitkat in a great cluttered home on the edge of the sea in cornwall tim and his dad a marvelous bill nighy share a love for table tennis an italian singer who appears to have a dead beaver on his head and each other dad tells tim about a maleinherited ability to time travel to be used for those moments when getting it just right can change your life tim moves to london where he falls instantly in love with the lovely mary rachel mcadams the soundtrack to their relationship is spot on  their everyday routine set to music is an homage to making every moment count i loved each of the major characters  sweet kitkat and lovable uncle desmond provide a counterpoint to the easy joy of mary and tim friends jay harry and rory are each part of the extended family the scenery set design and london locations are pure richard curtis with the tube as a major player and a wild cornwall storm made another character in the story there are some wildly funny moments and a lot of tears for a romcom as many times as ive seen it i want to see it again even though i always end up with tears on my cheeks,happy
a beautiful story about time travel and the importance of making every moment countdomhnall gleeson perfect in this role plays tim who at 21 discovers from his dad the brilliant bill nighy that the men in the family can time travel although preposterous the movie is more about relationships and how doing one thing different can alter our lives forever the film seems to drag a bit through the middle as you arent really sure where its going but by the last part of the movie it all comes together and it is so touching and sweet that it just makes you want to examine your life and your choices and move forward accordinglythe acting is so good everyone did a fantastic job i cant see anyone else working in those roles bill nighy is perfect in every role he takes on ive loved him ever since love actually when his character said and remember kidsdont buy drugsbecome a rock star and theyll give them to you he embodies every role hes in and he makes you believe hes actually the person hes playing he was so sweet in this role he was so relaxed and i realized after the fact that he truly is brilliant because his character was living every day twice in order to fully appreciate it this would have made him more at ease as a person because hed already lived through it once and would therefore know what was comingim not familiar with the actress who played the sister but she was very good in this as well as the actor who played rorythis is not overly sappy but it has a great message and other than the time travel thing it plays out very realisticallyeveryone should see this at least once,happy
oh my goodness i was a little hesitant to watch this movie seeing as i am not a big fan of romance flicks but i have to admit this one was way better than i expected it to be this is one of the best time travel movies ive seen even though it completely disregards the scientific aspects of time travel and instead opts for a fantasyexplanation youre definitely going to have a good laugh with this movie the comedy is on point and at the same time theres enough drama to balance the movie so that it doesnt become a corny and cheesy flickjust like the title suggests this movie isnt really about time travel per se but rather about time itself especially the end segment makes it perfectly clear that we the viewers should focus on living in the moment by truly embracing the time that were given instead of focusing on what ifs and regrets its a good messageoverall it is a fairly unique and interesting movie whereas most time travel movies focus on the science this movie goes the fantasy route and focuses more on the emotional aspects of time travel and it worked out pretty well you should definitely give this movie a watch you wont regret it,happy
this is one of the best movies i ever saw the way they defines the idea of happiness every moment is fabulous,happy
a film about love family friends and the crazy dynamic that holds everyone together theres just one catch the protagonist can time travel an heritetory gift passed down through generations allows for time travel within gleesons own lifefix the wrongs that have occurred try to make a better life for yourself yes its silly the so called laws of time travel conventional scifi do not applythe ultimate question is even if you could change something that has happened whats to say the new outcome is better you cannot cheat time it comes for us all great funny heartwarming film go with the flow and really take in the meaning,happy
i watched this movie because hbo listed it under scifi and the description mentioned time travel i am usually a little bored with romantic comedies but this movie was wonderful start to finish and every step of the way inbetween,happy
this film made me feel happyit made me cryand most importantly this film made me realise what ive been missing the most in my life  love,happy
the acting is superb the characters are lovable the story is well told and the message is a good one i love this movie i have watched it over 20 times and i never tire of this movie,happy
this movie makes it happen it starts as an ordinary movie of an ordinary thursday night however it turns out it is no more than a disguise this movie is one of the most profound and allinall complete movie i ever saw it makes you happy it makes you cry it makes you laugh out loud and more importantly it reminds you the most deeply important facts in our lives one more time but this time with graceabsolutely do not miss itover all 90,happy
its my first time to write a review here but i have to say that  the plot is fascinating its that kind of stories that you wish you live it it really touches your heart every thing is perfect just perfect,happy
first the movie was amazing it really does show how film making is changing and the writing on this movie was excellent the movie is a bit slow paced but in its entirety the movie was not disappointing the direction of the movie was the acting was amazing as always rachel mcadams was amazing lets talk about the story for a minute i would have really loved if the movie how they could time travel and how it works exactly but if you can look past that the story does mainly focus how the main character is a hopeless romantic with determination on finding love and will try to overcome anything for love if you are a hopeless romantic you will love this movie,happy
im a film buff i love 2001 tokyo story paths of glory my tastes range from classic cinema to modern drama and action but most of the time romcoms fail me i find the romance forced and the characters sappy and unrealistic and yet this film is unabashedly my favorite film of all timeas i rewatched it tonight for what might be the tenth time now i noticed new things just like i always do i fall in love with rachel mcadams just that much more and i cry more and more every time director richard curtis chose to separate this rom com not through adding a scifi element even though thats present but by making this a story about life about love about time and as we see his characters grow naturally after we meet them for the first time we attach to them and become a part of their family we grow with them we cry with them and it always brings me to tears by the end a long flow of tears of happiness for how beautiful this film istonight i had a new experience with about time too when i watched it and i rediscovered these wonderful fictional people it was like i saw all my old friends from high school like i got to sit in a cafe and share life stories with them and i loved every second of it just another reason to love this film,happy
films about time travel always intrigue me especially when done well about time is a good example of that what starts as a simple time travel story to improve a persons life becomes a story about family heartbreak and life lessons the protagonist shows that he never takes a day for granted and the people around him for granted from the outset the film takes a positive note and shows a positive character that is tolerable and likable for the most part not only is it interesting the events that unfold in this persons extraordinary ordinary life are quite entertaining to watch the drama is also well executed when tim finds that there are trade offs and challenges he faces with his ability the supporting cast especially bill nighy do a great job if you can get over the technical feasibility of time travel and the romantic or heartfelt fluff you will certainly enjoy this film i feel this might have scored very well with young married couples,happy
young love provides the framework for about time the latest movie from writerdirector richard curtis but the heart of the film is a story about a boy his father and the greatest gift they can give each other their timei have seen many time travel concepts before but this is where my heart pounded better than any wherenot only romances is magnificent humor and drama are also far better than many classics with heart touching soundtracks and songs the movie has eye pleasing scenescharacters are perfectly casted performance screenplay dialogues etc all are first class but the best is the presentation of emotions which could be linked to every single person who ever loved someone or just believes inthe movie begins with casual entries and remains a good entertainer till second half while in the last quarterending it cross a bridge and steps in best movie category platform with a message of livingi strongly recommend this movie to all the viewers yidioo,happy
just watched this brilliant movie for the 4th time and it was as fascinating as the very first time this is not a scifi not a romcom this is life in its most basic conceptual fashion i am so happy that this movie exists and i can watch it over and over and over again,happy
this is still a great production and has the potential to become a slowburn cult filmthe films strength paradoxically is its weakness its very englishness its middleclassness the niceness of its lead characters evokes an england yes an england  not a britain that never was except for a privileged few  and that is a hugely attractive draw the characters have warmth genuineness and kindness and live in a gentleness and sophistication that we would all like to experience for many people this is far from the reality of life and so this is effectively english disney this middleclass englishness pervades all of richard curtis films from this point the film lacks originality we have seen it all before we have also seen the timetravelling scenario in this case the technicality that tim jumps back and creates a parallel happening is overlooked  perhaps for reasons of practicality we dont know what happens to tim and his family in the life stream that he has left behind as he continues to live his new amended life butperhaps that is just me being picky but i will resist the temptation to travel back in time and erase that comment or it will be totally lostput those two minor flaws aside and you have film that is full of warmth and heart this film does make you value the people who have contributed positively to your life and what you personally would do when someone was injured or when the inevitable time comes to say goodbye it also reminds you of the awful and awkward gawkiness of your youth and how you wish you had handled it differently i loved the scenes where tim travelled back and replaced his crassness with emotional intelligence and sincerity all of the performances are strong bill nighy is as wonderfully bill nighy as ever lindsay duncan gives an original spiky and strong performance as the strangely unnamed mother  domnhall leeson projects a fragile and maturing appeal and will inevitably morph into hugh grant as he he ages and while i loved richard corderys uncle desmond the plot purpose of this role was somewhat lost on me i can only assume that it was to emphasise the complete warmth and acceptance of loving someone for whom they are and that existence can be enough in itself rachel mcadams is perfectly lovely and the everwonderful tom hollander is grumpily magnificent joshua mcgraths rory is a joy to watch not least because he has recreated a friend of mine and perhaps a little bit more could have been made of will merricks jay he has all the makings of a great richard curtis characterso for me this is a feelgood film and theres nothing wrong with that like richard curtis other films it is a welcome retreat to a screen family for whom you could love and care and whom you know well definitely a classic to snuggle up to on the sofa with something alcoholic or someone warm at the end of a trying day,happy
about time is a romantic comedy its witty clever intelligent and funny the centrepiece of the film is the relationship between tim domnhall gleeson a young lawyer living in london and his father bill nighy who lives with tims mother lindsay duncan in cornwallthis a story of a guy who can timetravel and has the ability to finetune moments of ones past tim and his dad have some hearttoheart talks that end up becoming lessons for all of us in how to livethis was a very sweet and thoughtful film highlighting how momentary decisions can completely alter your lifes pathi enjoyed the humour and wide range of emotions the story explored have you ever wondered what might the present be like if your choice had differed in the past we often tend to think that few times and regret over the choices we made in the past i myself have done this quite a lotthe main character in this movie tim turns out to be the same tim always seems down and unsatisfied with his lifehe wants to do things differently and wants his life to be different as the story progresses he finds out that he has powers that he always wished and learns how to use them then he falls in love unexpectedly then he starts his journey of life towards the love he is searching for this constitutes the best part of the movie his journey of life lets us learn many important things about life and how to really be happy and how to lead a peaceful lifethrough vicissitudes of life and love he learns few things about himself and what he should be focusing on i suggest you to watch this movie and to see  learn for yourselves what exactly are the precious moments of life and the attitude we need to have for this one and only precious life characters are perfectly casted performance screenplay  all are first class but the best is the presentation of emotions which could be linked to every single person who ever loved someonethat is why it is one my favorites when it comes to comedy and romance and its also a film of quite surprising depth,happy
a young man tim becomes aware of his own ability of time slip and hears this ability has been handed down from generations he use this ability for making his life and his familys life better particular his own love through his time travel he grows upin spite of sf or timetravel style this movie has love story and family story taking in time travel naturally the theme of movie is wide i think the balance of parts of comedy and serious are good so i can watch it with comfortable tempothis movie is one of my favorite movie i like a scene where tim and his father have the last meeting and he can never to meet again it moved me this film told me how important now is its so warm story,happy
it is a love story with a small element of science fiction it describes the love of normal girl and a man who is capable of travelling in timewhat is interesting to me is that the whole life story of the couple goes through in the drama beginning from their impressive encounter it portrays how they get along with get married and have a family however what makes a difference from any other popular love story is that the story goes back and forward because of the ability of timetravel it makes it possible that the story get complicated and excited furthermore as the title implies it gives out the message of the preciousness of time observing the development of love between them youll figure out the value of time because it never goes back and forward in the real life unlike the case of the drama in short it is not the simple story which entertains you from the aspect of love but the one that conveys the philosophical message to the audience,happy
this movie made me smile all along laugh sometimes with this incredibly smart screenplay and cry with is beautiful ending and thoughtful lesson that we can all learn from i just finish it and im still smiling this movie is good for the soul its like a medicine it heals i loved every minutes of it it starts with energy and humour and made me love every characters very fast then it turns to be the most romantic movie ever made make me wish i was this lucky girl from whom someone wait hours and hours in a museum just to meet her again thats real love and it makes me wish i had the ability of going back in time just to relive some of the most beautiful days of my life its some kind of magical and wonderful i would refer this excellent movie to every soul i know and hope you would watch it too,happy
just watched about time and im actually disappointed its taken me so long to watch it i wished id seen it at the cinema this film was amazing to the extent that this is my first review i loved everything about this film the cast are perfect the chemistry between the leads is spot on and believable this film makes you laugh cry wish you could have the ability i went through all the emotions this film has now smashed its way into my top 5 and wont be shifting recommend to all film lovers,happy
when i saw the rate of 78 i was hesitant but i saw rachel mcadams and margot robbie so i gave it a try ive always loved science fiction movies and time travel ones are the best this movie sparks emotions like when i saw the notebook and frequency youll end up calling your family members afterwards speaking of rachel mcadams and margot robbie both of them are gorgeous and if i had the ability to travel through time id try over and over with them i had to watch the movie with the close captioning because i had a little trouble understanding the uk english,happy
i cried i cried a lot i went into this movie thinking it was going to be a boring clich love story that was definitely not the case the story line flows well and im usually a person to poke holes in plots but i found myself completely enchanted throughout the whole film i instantly fell in love which each character even with the little screen time they had the love this film conveys is not the typical love story between a man and a woman but the love a person shares which each person in their life with that the love story between the two main characters felt so genuine and pure yet the best part is that thats not what the whole movie is about if you want a movie that will make you smile do yourself a favor and watch this spectacular movie,happy
where do i start with this movie the fact that this movie change my life the fact that the critics are a stupid hypocrite and really really stupid bunch of people the fact that out of so many movies i watch this is the best movie the best the cinematography the dialogues the writing the story the cast the humor the music when the first time i watched this movie i was awestruck i cried but it was tears of happiness all of the richard curtis movies are awesome but this one stands out literally the critics gave this movie only 70 rating i mean seriously this movie deserves a 100 rating literally and second i want to clarify something this is not just a romcom or chick flick because a tell me one movie like this one b i am a guy and i love this movie and ask any guy if he dont love this movie then he is a jerk trust me just watch this movie it brilliant and it seriously not a romcom it a dramatic comedy of family love and life,happy
first of all im not english born so bare with me any mistakethis is my first review on imdb being about one of my favorite movies of all time in great part because i miss my dad a lot im the boyfriend like a few reviewers said and not one bit ive felt bad about watching this movie instead ive watched this movie like 10 times already i like to thing in myself as a romantic but a romantic who also like action movies and scifi and intellectual stuff and a lot of other stuff i like interstellar a lot a movie that manage to give one of the best time travel facts but this movie isnt about time travel is about life isnt about the love of our life but the joy the hardness the decisions and the many loves of our mundane but brilliant life like i said before this movie moves me a lot i love my father immensely and would give a lot for just 10 more minutes with him and i love my girlfriend and mother and im pretty sure im gonna love my children one day what makes this world so extraordinary is the people we love people can be too judgmental when they only can see half the picture open your eyes try to go see a movie with an open mind and not trying to catch their flaws and you could be in for a treat,happy
i cant believe i have not seen this movie till 2016 this is the very first movie can make me laugh cry awe adore and still fill so satisfied after finishing it it s charming gentle funny but the best thing the film does is it does not make me feel upset about my own life and it taught me that i dont need to have any super power to have a fulfill happy life i am grateful really am for entertainment for those lessons i have never been taught for the laugh the tear and for the memory this definitely goes to my favourite list anybody reading this give it a try you wont regret i promise ,happy
this is very clearly a writers film with strong selfreference to more than one writing issuethe most obvious and extensively used device is the time quirk that literally creates the whole story the main character and all the males in his family have the ability to go back in time revisit scenes of their own lives and change them this means that every scene in the film does not have a definitive script everything can be changed all the time so the film flows as an ever provisional reality the way a writer works on a script or for those matters the way any creative artist works the girl works as a book publisher reading books from people commenting choosing changing them thats a winkthe other more clever device is the inversion of the genre rules that come with the time travel trick the film presents itself apparently as a romantic comedy that evolves into a light drama the drama is born from the natural course of life  people die life goes on kids are born there are no tensions brought upon the relation between the romantic couple exactly to emphasize how normal life is what drives the fate of these characters there is a moment when the possibility of adultery presents itself to the male character but he drives it away and this underlines again how definitive is the relationship between the couple but he can travel in time which means that even the facts of life are editable so he goes back in time and tries to change things like the poor love choices of his sister the tension is all put on the struggle between the main character and his ever changeable fate its an inversion of the rules in which pawn and queen are brought to the same game level one fighting the other imagine gone in the wind if scarlett could prevent the beginning of the war or move away before it came to them or something like thatthe acting is solid here and i always love the comical timing and acting of bill nighy this film wont change your life or affect it in significant ways but some parts of it will maybe stay with you and the honesty in the portrait of romantic couple and fatherson intimacy is truly remarkable from gleesonmcadams and gleesonnighy i trust curtis i always expect and know that he will always think about the structure of the film in terms of writing and that means that he cares about storytelling conceived specifically for the screen and i cherish that,happy
this was a movie about using time travel for mostly the right reasons on his 21st birthday a british man learns the men in his family have the gift to travel through timeonly to certain points in their own lifetimes and when they clench their fists and concentrate in a dark dank place he decides to use this gift to find a girlfriend and concentrates on an american girl named mary he also uses it to fix awkward moments after a stumbling block he begins to succeedthis is a good combination of comedy drama romance and fantasy i loved the new years party scene the awkward girlfriend scene the scene at the play and the shots of the cute kids i guarantee that you will love this movie  out of ,happy
this story has so much heart the way the storyline was portrayed was perfect to me i find it difficult to watch movies all the way through to the ending but this one was different i felt so many different emotions while watching this movie i enjoyed seeing the love of two people form over time and felt a true connection to the characters the heartbreak the memories of their past every little part of this movie spoke to my heart and made me reflect upon my own life what i would have changed in my past the birth of my own child and my close relationship with my father what would i have done differently if i was tim everything about this movie was so beautiful and i still cry every time i watch it this is the best movie i have seen in years i wish there were more like it,happy
my colleague a graduate of film studies recommended this movie to me we were talking about easy romantic comedies to fill up the breaks you need in between the hard strong meaningful movies she described it as enjoyable the adjective i remember i must warn you  it is about travelling in time and travelling in time does two things over and over again it gets complicated and confusing do count that as one thing and filmmakers usually love to incorporate hugely important matters into it the first thing can get at best interesting and it gets the viewers attention or terribly wrong and the viewer vanishes into the air as if they were never there in the beginning time travelling paradox pun intended the second usually involves a death of a person or better the end of the world most usually not cool about time forgive me if i will not spare you of this has both there is a confusion about the exact rules of time travelling and sometimes about the timeline were in but the rules get explained soon enough and they keep it quite simple  it is a romantic comedy after all and the important events well there is plenty but the disaster movies wouldnt bet their money on any of themthere were two main motivations of me seeing this movie one bill nighy and one bill weasley and neither of them had let me down bill nighy portrays a father of a family a man of wisdom gained most likely by time travelling books gained no doubt by time travelling and kindness hopefully by nature he takes care of a family which is described utterly charmingly and leaves the viewer at least as romantic and helplessly dreamy as i wishing for those kinds of families to be true it almost pains to leave the magical surroundings of an english country house to follow domhnall gleeson the son to london but his performance does not fall far under nighys and it goes hand in hand with the quality of narration of the movie the viewer is at times pleasantly surprised with unusual scenes as the one in dans le noir restaurant and more than occasionally with satisfying dialogues and i mean really satisfying the kind you dont expect in romantic comedies the makers though know that they have a strong material in hand when it comes to tims the sons family and not only do they visit it as the story progresses but make it essential and even more likable with time i have to come back to the end of the world topic and in this paragraph let there be spoilers because it just needs to be done in about time tim uses the ability first time to get the love of his life margot robbie to want him he spends the whole summer on that job and what a surprise in a romantic comedy doesnt succeed in the end another surprise is there is no unnecessary drama about this when he happily in love with another woman sees his first love after years he almost gives in to her charm but realizes in the last second where his heart lies and runs to ask rachel mcadams to marry him and here i must beg you to believe me when i say there is no superfluous drama in those scenes either all the drama is well set in the humour and sweetness and simple straightness of it all if there are scenes that make your heart skip a beat or your eyes to shed a tear they are not forced onto you rudely but find their way through the lines of a beautifully boring life but guess what  life is about the boring things the little things well occasionally there is a big and amazing thing but usually its just an ordinary life and this movie reminds you of that in a funny gloriously simple way that is completely free of cheesy my colleague described it as enjoyable and she was right i however need to add some adjectives it may have not been a hard movie but it was strong and meaningful i am going to enjoy tremendously the simple taste of my flavoured beer now and you go and give this movie a chance,happy
i think it is fair to say that about time is a beautiful movie of a wonderous tender and maddeningly sweet love story you are just bond to feel good about thatas simple as it can be we are naturally in love with the sincerity the movie offers from the beginning and true to the message it carries forgetting the time travel element by the end richard curtis is doing just a fit clean job in capturing every emotions in such a beautiful gesture that made about time gracefully wonderfultim lake is such a endearing character that created domnhall gleeson a special place in my heart forever we just love tim and mary period because romantic dramas are lately doomed with a heartbreaking tragedy undeniable hardship and often someones dying too early about time is lightly a more humble story of a man and a woman with enviable love true that the pair is getting all the spotlight but we cant fall for the familys love any less growing up in equally enviable family whom rule number one is to dwell on beauty of life young tim is having the same insecurities we all seem to have about the future because he didnt feel good enough time travel is one extraordinary thing but it is not too long through trials and errors before he realized that it doesnt help him any good unless he himself does something good in the end of the day time travel doesnt win mary for him as the story goes it is just heartwarming to see how much wiser and maturer tim got he is madly in love with his dad mum and adorable sister kitkat just as much as he is madly in love with mary dad is a figure you wish you had in your lifesomeone you couldnt bare to say goodbye we learned about how much a big kind love like that can give us and how much a simplest act of love can give to even a stranger we meet on the street the writing is beautiful the casts are stunning i missed the characters the moment the credits rolled and wished i had known them in my real life id honestly like to thank richard curtis because without trying to be exaggerating ive learned life,happy
the idea of a romantic comedy movie where the lead character is able to travel back in time sounds kind of odd but the production turned out to be excellent this movie provided me with so many fun laughs the jokes in this movie were very funny and not repetitive the settings were also very beautiful as i felt parts of london were displayed very well one of the best parts of this movie without a doubt is the acting domhall gleason who is now a powerhouse actor landing roles in major productions such as star wars the force awakens the revenant and brooklyn played the role perfectly right from facial expressions to body language this for sure was one of the great performances that got his name out towards the public rachel mcadams also played the part of the lead actress very well as she stayed well tuned to her character lastly the overall symbolism and meaning in the movie was quite amazing it is usually quite rare to find a great romcom that has strong symbolism but this movie hit both fronts almost perfectly in conclusion about time is a feel good mod movie fuelled by strong performances and is likely to be enjoyed by several of the viewers who watch it,happy
the plot of the film has a unique and a genius idea the characters are perfect and you will connect with each and every one of them also the acting is great after watching this film i felt like how awesome it is to have the ability to travel in time you can literally relive the moments you loved and improve the mistakes you made okay the main plot is completely imaginative and fancy but the characters and their development is realistic overall a great movie just loved every single bit of it why i didnt give it a perfect 10 well its because of the plot holes i clearly noticed a lot of plot holes in the movie but the movie kept me captivated and eventually the plot holes didnt bother me much although it did a little bit p the main concern of the movie isnt scifi so you can ignore it and enjoy the movie or complain about it you have to give it a try though,happy
i absolutely thoroughly enjoyed this film the concept is very exciting and makes you wonder what you wouldve done if you had such a gift the film also manages to mix romance with comedy and sadness at just the right amounts its very clear and there arent many moments where you can criticise and say that that doesnt make any sense or find flaws which i tend to have a habit of doing when watching films like these the film is timed perfectly not too long or short and kept me captivated all the way through just amazing what you could do with the same gift i just wonder how many people will watch the film and then try and go into a dark cupboard and try to go back in time ,happy
this film has it all the story is beautifully written and the twists small and large are very well thought out this is a masterwork of detail many if which interlink at times with subtlety that only a very clever work can attain the acting is superb from all players and the character depth and breadth exceptionalyou sense that you really know these people you can sense that they really exist and that the film is utterly factual such is the magic of this works quality the filming and screenplay are well above average even after careful scrutiny i cannot find fault the term a must see has been over used but to me it genuinely applies to this wonderful work,happy
if you are looking to watch a feel good movie without being too critical on the plot you should definitely watch this film best of all the accompanied soundtrack that goes along the show is awesome to say the least all the songs fits perfectly and beautifully into each scenes the main gist of the show tells that ability to time travel to relive and right the wrongs of your life this plot may be overly used in many films but it has slanted to a more family love  fathers love mostly  directions which is not often seen in most travelbackintime movies the protagonist of the show is a young men who learned from his father one day that the all men in the family have the ability to time travel so went to the adventures of his time travels which his main motivation at first is finding the love of his life it is wonderfully played out when he manages to find the girl he love and using the time travel ability going back in time to right any wrong to ensure the ideal outcome all is well at this moment in this movie  which had done real well focusing on his love life and then fatherhood life then his sisters misfortune came in and the strange explanations on the adverse effects of time travel to change some outcome does not really gel too well with the general flow of the film the later part of the show  last 30 mins seems to be losing the grip but a meaningful ending with the father ensures a reasonable finish to the end some hiccups for this movie but the feel good factor persist throughout the movie and i certainly did not regret watching this on a saturday night feeling good throughout the show,happy
a time travel movie with depth it was refreshing to see time travel which is not all about saving the world or some extraordinary event but is used more to develop characters in their everyday lives as such i found it gripping and moving the casting was great bill nighy had great empathy and feeling and domhnall gleeson was a great choice of protagonist the fact that he is not your average swashbuckling star made the plot all the more fascinating  rachel macadams was just lovely and lindsay daveport was a true to life foil to bill nighy the supporting cast did a great job of filling it out all in all a lovely movie worth watching many more times as so many of ruchard curtis movies are,happy
its far better than i expectedwelli gotta admit i thought its another boring love story with some weird silly timetravel elementwhich isobviouslynot the caseits a love storyyesbut more than that kind of romantic loveitd be a real great idea to watch it with my girlfriend and i would never ever wish to travel back to change that ideaexcept for the fact i dont actually have oneunfortunately my favorite part is about the father and the sonits so lucky to be able to travel back in timeplay tabletennis with the old man againwellnot necessary tabletennisbut watch your dad growing older and oldermore and more white hairtrying to pretend everything is okwhich is notthat is the hardest momentand somedayi have to accept the fact that i have to say goodbyesoon or later,happy
after watching this movie it has been my favorite although it contains fantastic things like traveling in time the film came to me quite realistic although rachel mcadams is not much beautiful she has played women to be in love also beginning of the film domhnall gleeson is not seems like 30 years old he seems teenager guyin this movie there is not only love familyrelated things made me said but at the wedding scene made me both laugh and sadalso its soundtrack is simple but so good httpwwwyoutubecomwatch vvmilf705qxe,happy
i do not want to read the negative reviews because i am worried it may spoil the way this film has made me feel of course everybody is different so i will not slate the reviews which arent so positivethe message this film carries has made me change the way i feel in the morning after i wake up its incredible it doesnt make me want to have the super powers the main character possess but makes me want to learn the same way he does its not the usual corny romance thing nor the clich time travel flick i was expecting but much much more the spectacular cast setting soundtrack and plot all make this film one of my personal favourites its like the best bits of love actually the time travelers wife and one day all in one beautiful spectacle i would absolutely recommend this film to anyone as a kind meaningful and heartwarming movie,happy
how long will i love you as long as stars are above you if someday you got the power to fly through the time maybe you would keep living your day over and over to make it different or tried to go back again to experience something memorable but living fully isnt much more important than living once again to cherish remarkable life isnt the best enjoyment hardly can we control and perceive every subtle changes in life seize the moment will be the greatest strategythis movie is totally awesome never and ever miss it the power of the pictures for people who want to discuss more with me can join this group in facebook gikkingen humbert,happy
wow i was blown away after genuinely sobbing my heart out i felt compelled to write a review ive never been so touched and moved by a film before not even a book has gotten close to be honest i didnt even want to watch it but having a brief insomnia encounter and having watched everything on my dvd shelf i put this on and i am so glad i did you know what calling this film a film doesnt actually seem right it feels like ive watched a montage of a real family believe it or not even the time traveling fit this beautifully directed acted written piece of art will stay in my heart and mind forever its not only taught me that ginger men rock but all you really need in life is to give love and be loved love is all that matters,happy
this is one of the best film ive had watched yet  when it started i thought this is gonna be a boring movie but its the simplicity that makes everything so live this types of movies really makes you feel so happy like the pursuit of happiness or a little bit of heaven you see lovecaremistakesdisappointmentanger in short life the narration is so good and hats off to richard curtis for both writing and directing in my honest opinion if someone tell you that this is not a good movie that means that person has no feelings for love and family  i have been using imdb for years now but this movie made me write this review thank you,happy
about time is a wonderful time travelsromantic comedy film the rhythm is perfect and i must give my congratulations to who wrote this storythis movie is fresh modern  colorful an romantic in this film  the main character travels in time to do somethings he made wrong he never uses this ability for money only for find the right girl the first time he meets them is magic but the other times when he tries to do all again are not so magic and that is what this film means you gotta live your day once at the time and enjoy every details and every moments that you are with your familyfriends behind the good things this movie has bad points toothe acting is not the best and the storylinescript has some errorshowever i laughed i cried and i quite enjoyed this moviei strongly recommend you to see about time,happy
this is one of the movies you have to add to your must watch list i was expecting it to be a hilarious and sweet movie with a lot of secrets and drama and it did have it all except that it wasnt my type of humor it did make me laugh a couple of times its also sadder that one might expect it to be but theyve made this movie in a way that when the scene gets sad it always changes into a happy mood just watch it you wont ever regret iti also thought the acting was great especially the characters who arent the main ones the whole plot was really really good and its not one of the typical time traveling kind of movie its really original and its very very watchable just watch it no matter what the other reviews say,happy
my first review so bare with me if youre looking for a light hearted romantic movie and are willing to overlook some science fictionness to a film that doesnt quite make sense and rules that are added to complicate it with little explanation then this is for youbeautiful message of appreciating life and truly cherishing the people around you really hits the message home hard some of the acting leaves more to be desired the dialog is light and fluffy and nothing to get terribly lost in leaves you wanting to go out and hug your loved ones and enjoy each and every moment which is what were supposed to be doing anyway film gets a bit convoluted at times and takes some left turns that i could have done without however over all enjoyable dont go expecting an oscar but well done indeed,happy
as a generally unemotional guy i couldnt help but be touched by this story not only beautiful in its execution but its attention to the little things that translate the vulnerable and imperfect into the truly beautiful things they are was captured as best ive ever seen as for the cast they were fantastic could not say enough about the immense chemistry between them all not for a second did i doubt the love between the family and relationships portrayed the film will have you questioning events missed and misplayed in your own life as well as creating an alertness that will likely carry some value knowing you will only get one shot at things and not to let the warning signs from those you love go ignored a rare film and i watch them all so i say that with confidence im sure youll agree,happy
movie worth watch lovely script lovely execution after a long time i saw this type of movie if you like something soft to watch so this would be nice choice what a lovely movie i enjoyed it very much movie has lots of good movements which make you smile amazing movie and amazing message live your every day like it is the last day enjoy it embrace itthe film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running timethis movie was already on my watch list and i was avoiding itbut hell i was wrongtheres something more to it the story line was genius and smart and the acting by the cast was really superb,happy
when i saw the trailer my first thought was why is rachel mcadams in another time traveler movie second thought  why another time traveler movie after the trailer the thoughts were still the same but with one detail this one seems funnier it was seeing the score here at imdb that made me wonder if it would really be just another movie same story same characters etc  so i dared myself i watched it and what a wonderful surprise this movie is another romantic comedy the foundations of the movie are the same as usual the not so pretty not so funny not desired on the contrary dismissed boy meets shy girl that is much more than she thinks and they fall in love but this only goes for half the movie this half although manages to tell the very same story that we know but in a more intelligent way making it more believable than usual the second part for me its the masterpiece its where the big message rely the movie becomes something more grows like the character in it it still tells the story of most people but in the way that reminds all of our history with a beautiful sensibility this movie its about a time traveler in the beginning i found it impossible like any common human being at the end we realize it isnt fiction this time traveling we should all make every day,happy
this movie was already on my to watch list since a lot of people recommended it to me i didnt really had my hopes high up for this movie because i really thought that its gonna be the typical time travel romance movie where a guy is having fun doing all the time traveling then he realized he messed up and tried to do it right again and hell i was wrong about time is not just a time travel romance movie theres something more to it the story line was genius and smart and the acting by the cast was really superb id recommend it for anybody,happy
you know those websites which can automatically write a politicians speech or a covering letter when all they have to go on is a few multiple choice options you have selected well who knew richard curtis had found the equivalent for romantic comedies the options richard curtis selected at random one can only presume unless his 2 year old niece danced on his keyboard while he was doing something unbelievably humanitarian in order to make up for the millions of hours of peoples time that he will have wasted with this film were and in no particular order 1 a film that audiences will forget that they are watching while they are watching iti forgot to mention that he only had one option to select and that of the millions at his disposal he selected what we can now safely call the richard curtis option all hollywood and english speaking production companies have a richard curtis button somewhere on each of their keyboards unfortunately this button is so overused that the ink has dissolved leaving what looks like a mini space bar if you find yourself laughing crying or in any way involved with the characters in this film please step away from your computer and any household appliances in your vicinity before you do yourself an injurymaybe im being a bit harsh i mean lets face it how many films out of 10 these days do we actually enjoy oh wait maybe thats the point i am trying to make,happy
this is the story of nice little  if unoriginal  idea one that could be the basis of a nice little short movie or even a brilliant masterpiece of a short movie but 2 hours gasp yuk please about time is lovely written of course every scene is charming subtle and funny and just spot on and the cast is just wonderful but the whole story is a chore once tim gets the love of his life what do we care everything else looks tediously uninteresting there is nothing left to fight for and the philosophical lesson the great secret of happiness is very long in the telling so you just want to get it over within french we say that happy people are not worth a story and thats exactly the point here you just wish you wont have watch years and years in the life of a happy man who can go back in time and tweak every little detail he got wrong the first time and with not real major downside i guess this pretty soon gets boring to him as it got boring for bill murray in the groundhog day before he understand that love would be the meaning of lifein about time our hero tim is just a nice little boy very clean adorable and sweet upbringing sure it is not a ken loach movie but soft and gentle soap opera must we one plain boring nerd with a plain boring perfect cute love story he patches together groundhog day was about a curse not a fancy gift and bill murray was an edgy and fascinating character indeed same starting point great movie here insufferable drivel there,happy
after a ten year absence from the romcom genre richard curtis must have thought its about time i made another alas about time was made the film stars domhnal gleeson who fills the boots of hugh grant as curtis lead man only to be accompanied by the always elegant rachel mcadamsas one might imagine the film is simply about time domhnal gleeson plays tim  a pleasant romance obsessed young englishman looking for love sadly despite his best efforts he struggles to find it this is until his father bill nighy unveils the family secret that will change tims fortunes  that tim can travel back in timewhat unfolds is a series of groundhogdaylike trips to the past where tim desperately tries to change his romantic loses tims counter clockwise visits create the bulk of the comedy as he awkwardly tries to woo the beautiful mary played by rachel mcadamsa lighthearted touch is maintained for the most part as a result you have plenty of goofy characters pitching in along the ride whilst gleeson tries to shape his life into an ideal mold as the film leads to a more dramatic second half curtis induces thought provoking questions of life as tim discovers the many consequences that arise from changing his past curtis does well to avoid being overtly profound achieving a delicate crescendo in tone as the film draws its meaningabout time sweetly delivers its message by the conclusion however despite tims love infused nature the film tends to lag romantically a potentially harmonious chemistry between mcadams and gleeson is often sidelined for clockwork antics romance and time  if no longer unique  still remains a fun concept however about time doesnt equate to time warped predecessors like benjamin button and midnight in paris,happy
i really dont know where to begin with this one i usually write that i am a film student or that im 16 or that i saw this with my mum or my best friend or something along the lines of i am a film nerd but truthfully i think this films too good for my writing clichs i have never in my life found a film so emotionally engaging i have never seen a film with characters so relatable and so believably amazing its justwowok where to begin ok ill start with tim domhnall gleeson is just perfect he really his his accent his persona his chemistry with rachel mcadams his relationship with his father and his sister and what he says about her at the beginningthat she is the most wonderful thing in the world and his hopeless romanticism as well as his disbelief when his father tells him about the time travelling the thing that was so amazing about his character was how he just seemednormal really how he was extraordinary and funny and appreciative of everything but he was just so ordinary yet so different at the same time and i found him so relatable and beautifuland justwow that phrase will be used a lot in this review ok tims dad bill nighy first of i love bill nighy he was stunning in this filmseriously flawless his character was funny and inspiring and justwow how he tells tim is just hilarious and how they play table tennis and oh his speech at the wedding is just so beautifulit actually made me cry and when he dies and tim has to say goodbye and tim goes back and they go on the walk they did when he was a kid was just so beautifulim actually crying writing this review he really reminded me of my dad actuallycompetitive funny strange and undeniably insane yet thankful for every second of his lifethats what i want to be likethe sisterkit kat katie kittle kattle oh my gosh was she amazing seriously i loved her so muchher character was charmingly funny and friendly and such a great person yet fell down some wrong pathswhen she got hit by the cari cried so much she was justseriously hilarious yet so relatable and lovable the film would definitely have not be the same without heri could just go on and on and oni havent even mentioned how beautiful rachel mcadams character was or how much i loved uncle bernard who is quite a lot like me or how amazing richard curtis is as a director but im going to end it here and say that this review really does not do this incredibly inspiring ore creating extraordinary film which is now my favourite film ever justice i would rate this film a million out of 10 if i couldits just beautiful and if you havent seen it see it it really is flawless,happy
walking into the cinema with little knowledge about the film other than it had rachael mcadams and bill nighy in it it was sure to say i didnt know what i was expecting however i was pleasantly surprised the film starts of with tom a 21 year old looking for love however having no success his search however all changes when his farther nighy tells him he can turn back time he meets a charming woman mcadams and even though they start of a bit slowly everything eventually falls into place and they have a wonderful relationship there are some twists and turmoils throughout which he tries to repeat however on some occasions fate has to take its course i have saw tim previously in a programme called black mirror and instantly recognised him as i thought he was brilliant in that domhmall gleeson is definitely a rising star in my eyes and he suited the role perfectly this is a film which is going to be up there with notting hill and love actually as its original story brilliant cast and directing are all fantastic great film for a date night and a must see film all round 810,happy
this film is a must see and quite the tear jerkedi must say i was taken back by this great little film i think curtis really understands what makes a good film and that is a good story and script to go with it this film might go over some critics heads as they will probably be looking very closely to find a flaw and miss the lovely flow and small moments of magic well done mr curtis i look forward to seeing your next film and hope it comes sooni will be recommending this one to all my friends and probably look to buy a copy on dvd i must also go back and re watch his other films to see if there was any magic i missed previously i loved notting hill but awful sound track,happy
i walked into the movie theater only because of my girlfriend who wanted to see something romantic so i entered the halfempty hall full with skepticism expecting both a waste of my time and money i was later amazed by the incredible outstanding quality of this film which made me think about what i have done with my life until that point it made me realize how beautiful life can actually be it made me understand that it is up to you to fill your days with happiness and give them a point and a meaning this definitely goes into my top 5 excellent collaboration between the cast the director the producers and the screenplay writers,happy
if you like a movie that is heartwarming and pleasant somewhat magic and inspiring  this is the perfect one it is a family movie with a bit of romance drama and that fantasy kick that takes you where you always wanted to go as a child  back in time some of the reviews here hated the movie and they almost prevented me from watching it expecting boring 2 hour paint drying disaster but i watched it anyways it was a beautiful surprisemade me laugh made me wet my eyes a bit made me thinkperfect little family drama very charming in storytelling with some interesting situations and intelligent yet simple dialogues if i had to describe it id say its a movie about normal ordinary people who try to live the best they can and it inspires me to try and do the best out of my own everyday endeavors about time is as charming as amelie but less fantasyfullid say just more real which makes it easier to relate to on everyday basis,happy
both me and my wife have watched this film several times in the cinema and we have just pre ordered this on amazonat first i was quite pessimistic about this movie another romantic movie  chick flick which i tend to avoid at the cinema and wait for once released on dvd i am so pleased i agreed to see it it is quite possibly one of my favorite movies and one i know i will watch over and overhaving watched all of richards movies i have to say he has really outdone himself the script is refreshingly original and executed perfectly although the film is supernatural not sure if this is considered a spoiler in the sense that the main protagonist can travel through time the movie it self is about the everyday struggles of life and how this unique gift helps tim often in hilarious ways it especially tugs on my heart strings because of the relationship tim has with his fatheri gave this movie 10 out of 10 because i honestly could not think of a single fault even down to the soundtrack which lifts you up just at the right places and then utterly devastates you later i think this film will appeal to viewers of all ages and i really cannot recommend it enough,happy
my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it is a wellwritten touching humorous and entertaining the r rating is unfortunate as it will limit the audiences for what is otherwise a great movie for a broad audience 4 utterances of the fword and suggestive bed scenes without nudity for us this movie is why theaters were created it was uplifting and theatergoers left feeling good about life it was one of those rare movies that drew audience applause when it ended great performances by domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams and bill nighyrichard curtis has another outstanding achievement to add to notting hill love actually and other films he has written and directedsee this film you will be supporting quality writing directing and filmmaking,happy
i hope the actors and the director etc read this thank you for making such an amazing movie it was so tenderhearted and sweet and i just loved the relationships the main character had with his family character development i thought it was a lost art in hollywood and oh my goodness the last 20 minutes or so i was trying so hard to choke down actual sobbing i get teary in movies sometimes but this was a full out breaking of the heart i was still crying on my way into the lobby on the way out im still thinking about this movie im still thinking about what tim was saying at the end about living in every day in the present moment trying not to miss anything im telling everyone to see this movie it was so great thank you,happy
about time is a romantic comedy starring rachel mcadams and domhnall gleeson this movie is great heartfelt and funny despite being somewhat long and kind of dragging the plot out the message and the storyline makes it worthwhile even though it was somewhat predictable with the guy star getting the girl star it was refreshing to see that it did not take the whole film for him to woo and get her like in most romantic comedies they become a couple fairly quickly which i loved the film is basically about their journey as a couple and him using his time traveling ability to change fairly minor details like the first time they have sex which wasnt that great so he went back in time twice doing much better each time he goes back in time later in the film to try to help his sister get her life together after she gets in a terrible accident but when he comes back he has a different child so he realizes he cant save her that way mcadams and gleeson were great for this part and they had such a believable amazing connection you can really see and feel the connection between them it has a great superb energy that despite being long is a great interesting watch it was the best 1000 i ever spent it is such a feel good movie that it captivates the audience from start to finish it is so good that everyone men women children and the elderly could all enjoy it this film is witty charming and full of clever charming jokes it is definitely one of the best romantic comedies of the year its a movie that acknowledges that life is messy and it sometimes isnt going to play out the way you want it to but it also stops to see its beauty about time is a beautiful film to watch it is sometimes a little rough and somewhat long winded but those are small when compared to the joy and message that embraces them,happy
my wife and i went to see this film hoping for a lighthearted romantic date flick one reviewer called this movie a chick flick for men although on the surface this may be one characterization this film is so so much more than a simple date movie or chick flick for men or women neither is this a scifi movie as some have described although some aspects can definitely be described as magical at the root this films message is living life to the fullest trying to always live life in the moment enjoying the simple things in life like seeing your children growing up sipping tea with your loved ones at the beach or buying a sandwich at the local store during a lunch break at work the film reminds us that much of our lives are spent worrying about what has happened in the past and what could happen in the future and that much of this worry will never come to be and ends up being just lost time and wasted emotions as much as we may want to relive certain experiences in our lives we can only experience each moment once there are no second chances this moment is all we have and we must make the best of itrachel mcadams is terrific and lovely in this film she is real and authentic and her performance is wonderfully sincerethis film should not be reserved for a date night it should be seen by parents grandparents and adult children we all need to be reminded about what is really important in life and this film does just that it will leave you inspired awed and reawakened enjoy,happy
if you were able to travel back in time to the past events of your life what exactly would you change in richard curtis new timetravelling romanticcomedy tim domhnall gleeson decides to go back and change his life all in the name of love not that he could really go back and kill hitler or shag helen of troy as his father suggestssince the early 2000s the british romanticcomedy is becoming as much of a staple in the genre than any piece of american romcom cinema has recently disregarding the american romantic indie features whether it be the cute accents the gingerbred protagonists or the intricate unique narrative tropes which excel certain points of the love story those british buggers are succeeding in a genre that generally lacks such a large emotional response in big budgeted hollywood filmsin the film aspiring law student tim lives with his parents played eloquently by bill nighy and lindsay duncan his freespirited sister kit kat lydia wilson and uncle desmond richard cordery in a charming home overlooking the bay in cornwall england on the morning of tims twentyfirst birthday he is summoned to his fathers study only to be told that the men in his family have the amazing ability to travel back in time within the timeline of their own lives of course in utter disbelief and against his will tim follows his fathers instructions finds a dark place clenches his fists and thinks back to new years eve only to rectify his mistake of missing out on kissing a beautiful girl at the stroke of midnight enchanted he returns to his father exclaiming its going to be a complicated year where his father replies its going to be a complicated lifeabout time is a charming utterly tender tale of life love and the extraordinary of the ordinary much like the narrative of the film tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life yet the film is anything but perfect and thats ok suffering from inconsistent plotpoints to breaking the rules that the film outlines about time is surely not a tightlyconstricted narrative leap for the genre by any means regardless the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts ones spirit but causes you to merely forget about the rules curtis makes and breakswriterdirector richard curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romanticcomedy genre making major waves penning bridget joness diary love actually notting hill and four weddings and a funeral although he has stated that about time will be his final directorial venture only behind the aforementioned love actually and pirate radio curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything nicholas sparks has made with the exception of the notebook of course fresh spontaneous and demanding emotions curtis has brought new light to the british romanticcomedy front and has made the kind of films one isnt ashamed to laugh and cry atonce tim finally meets mary rachael mcadams tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his timetravelling powers at first glance gleeson and mcadams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward instead much to the extent and reality in life the two feed off one anothers unique characteristics splendidly tall pale and with a hint of orange hair gleesons unique onscreen charm is brashly alluring mcadams on the other hand stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather ragtag girlnext door look reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her  quirks and allmcadams who is no stranger to the timetravelling love story narrative venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest first in the time travelers wife and two years later in woody allens acclaimed midnight in paris enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles bringing a believable essence to the role of mary mcadams just may cement herself in time as the goto romanticcomedy poster girlas a love story about time succeeds as a tale of morality a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son the film triumphs gleeson and nighy share some of the most sentimental and heartwrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy incandescent as father and son the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the filmas the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year about time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013 especially since i am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme about time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyones seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it but the film whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive is a movie about appreciating the little things some days you want to relive forever some days you want to live once and richard curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film essentially about time is really all about love and we are alright with thatnight film reviews 910 stars,happy
this movie was very creative and well thought out i absolutely loved the storyline it was brilliantly written and had the perfect amount of humor and drama w a little time travel sprinkled on top rachel mcadams delivers as always and domhnall gleeson is absolutely charming i would highly recommend you check out this movie but be sure to bring a tissue its a tear jerker i would give the movie a 10 but there is one character in particular that i did not care for the character was a little over the top for no apparent reason there were also a few shots that were shaky and made me a little dizzy,happy
   graces this import from britain the best movie about flipping ones chronology since last years safety not guaranteed both of these films put thoughtful and creative new spins on time travel which is necessary when the majority of the films made in this genre lack coherence and internal consistency while there may be a point or two to quibble over regarding about time my main sticking point being the midmovie appearance of boy posyundoing that snafu seems like closing the barn door after the livestock has escaped its generally tougher to push toothpaste back into the tube the excellence of the acting performances tends to smooth over any such rough patches longtime british alister brendan gleesons son domhnall is a revelation in the lead role of tim and bill nighy he of the octopus beard in the pirates of the caribbean franchise looks more like a screenmatch dad for tim than brendan would have been plus he pulls his role off with a level of tenderness not seen in most of the screen parts played by domhnalls reallife father frequently cast as a heavy about time is not for those who forget their hankies but it is a great date flick,happy
i often go to these free movies with low expectations and this one was no different however they dont all surprise me like this one did it was a pleasant surprise no doubt i went in on the notion that this was going to be a chick flick and be entirely sad with no humor in it oh how wrong i wasdomhnall gleeson tim added some humor to the movie but i credit most of it to bill nighy dad and richard cordery uncle d however i warn you to bring tissues with you if you have any heart at all the same characters that makes you laugh will also make you cry then laugh again then cry again thats what happens when you can travel through timethis movie hasnt had a lot of hype or attention but it should i definitely recommend seeing this movie while its in theaters,happy
darn  i just wasted 2 hrs of my life it started well i must say but that main character tim is pretty horriblehe tried to be funny by using those dumb stupid punchlinesis there even a story in it  the directorwriter basically copy pasted some stories like butterfly effectgroundhog day time travellers wife and also some other god knows what majority of the critics are fake here and thats the only reason for such a high rating for this dumb movie  dont watch  total waste  wish i could time travel and bring those valuable time back alas darn  i just wasted 2 hrs of my life it started well i must say but that main character tim is pretty horriblehe tried to be funny by using those dumb stupid punchlinesis there even a story in it  the directorwriter basically copy pasted some stories like butterfly effectgroundhog day time travellers wife and also some other god knows what majority of the critics are fake here and thats the only reason for such a high rating for this dumb movie  dont watch  total waste  wish i could time travel and bring those valuable time back alas ,happy
those of us who are partial to curtisland have had to wait ten years for the next instalment  love actually 2003 was the last film in the genre curtisland is that corner of middle england inhabited mostly by twentysomething uppermiddle class people who live somewhat unreal lives mostly as a member of a group of bright mostly attractive usually louche sometimes and funny consciously or unconsciously friends it first appeared in the 1994 hit film four weddings and a funeral and again in notting hill 1999 and love actually it also featured strongly in bridget jones diary 2001 and its successor bridget jones  the edge of reason 2004 the films of curtisland are entertainment and often make us laugh out loud  at least the first three did the main accusation thrown at curtis is that the films are sentimental sentimentality is a pretty subjective concept the american author mitch albom said critics have a problem with sentimentality readers do not i write for readers i dont know whether richard curtis would agree with this but i suspect that he might and with graham greene who said that sentimentality  thats what we call the sentiment we dont sharewhich brings me to about time yes it is an extremely sentimental film but the romcom bit is actually fairly unsentimental and rather good tim domhnall gleeson  a gingerheaded brit falls for mary rachel mcadams  a seriously pretty american who falls for him they get it together and get married and have babies that to do this tim has to use a facility to travel back in time he gets in a dark cupboard and clenches his fists to do this to earlier moments in his own life is endearing and allows for some amusingly restructured moments not least when he travels back to rescue mary from a jerk of a boyfriend by ensuring that they dont even meet the meeting falling in love marriage and babymaking of tim and mary happens fairly quickly  in a two hour film it occupies most of the first half hour and not much more the film is a paean to parenthood there are two equally sentimental aspects to this the first is the relationship between tim and his father bill nighy the second is the babymaking and delights of parenting that tim and mary share nighy as ever plays himself very well hes the sort of father who doesnt effuse with touchyfeelyness but gradually as the film progresses and as he brushes losingly with mortality he feels the need to tell his son he loves him etc etc poor old mum nicely played by an underused lindsay duncan doesnt get much of a look inbut what of the parenting of tim and mary this takes up a lot of screen time here they really do run the gamut of emotions from a to b i cannot recall a film ive seen with so much gratuitous baby business in them now i must reveal a bias here baby stuff is a sentiment i certainly dont share no doubt others in the packed cinemas that are watching about time around the world will not agree with me and curtis is being very clever in giving this sentiment a free run if we combine the fatherson story and the babymaking story together under the general paean to parenthood theme this is as i say what most of the film is about and if thats your thing youll no doubt love it i rather sank in my seat as it went onfar better for me was the theme illustrated by some time travel moments of living as fully as possible every day tim sums it up i try to live every day as if it were the final day of my extraordinary ordinary life there is one excellent sequence when tim goes through a day without laughing or smiling much too busy to notice as individuals the people around him then he decides to reprise the day with time travel and this time he makes an effort to relatesurrounding the main characters in curtisland there are always secondary characters who bumble through the film  often making one major comic turn along the way in about time there is tims batty sister as in notting hill kit kat lydia wilson who is rather more than batty actually and nearly dies as a result of a drunken car crash at one point she is rescued by tim and mary because she is lovable really and just needs a good man rather than a rat to save her the good man is another member of the ginger tribe tim is ginger jay will merrick and in the end they have settled down together and they have a baby no surprise there then then there is the role usually played by rowan atkinson of the strange eccentric tom hollander got the part of the foulmouthed boozy playwright harry i thought that this was a very funny portrayal  a man so unpleasant you feel he must have graduated with a phd in nastinessthis is a twohour film and is i would suggest at least halfanhour too long the story of the accident to kit kat just goes on and on  thats the trouble with time travel life tends to repeat itself there are also some plot inconsistencies and tricks which make little sense would i recommend it  perhaps not if you arent into babies and slushy fatherson scenes on the other hand rachel mcadams is absolutely lovely as well as being a very good actorif you think that you might share the sentiment then go along to about time if you think that you might not  but you go anyway  you might need to shut your eyes a bit at times,happy
i was invited for a screening today and mostly went because rachel mcadams is beautiful well firstly im not into british movie and this one didnt help to change my mind the script was the problem really the dialogue are really good but the story is not proportional first its a love story about a guy who find his love then you have to forget about it and focus only on the dad and then once you think it s finally going to be over you realise that its actually going to be a lifetime story of a man rushed near the end the girlfriend rachel mcadams is kind of the heart of the movie in the first part then shes nonexistent in the second half why so much built up in a character to just not use it later she literally sleep in all her scenes all the part with the dad is quite good thank to a very good acting from bill nighy the dadthe main actor is not likable as well unless you fancy skinny ginger hair the non nice looking guy who got only the hot girls i m sorry was i watching an american movie nothe idea had a very good potential but i guess the screenwriter got a bit too existed in the message he tried to deliveredso my 5 is only for the dialogues and bill nighyso go see this movie if you like bill nighy because hes really worth it in it otherwise dont bother just wait it air on itv with the weather and news in the middle of the film,happy
i came across this movie after a google search of movies like coherence and primer led me to a website that listed 10 movies supposedly similar with this one being the only one on the list i hadnt seen before if youve seen those movies before then youll know my reaction to that websites recommendationwhat this movie is nothing like those movies exceptand this is a stretchone small component that makes this movie a unique love story other than that one thing this movie is exactly what it looks like a sappy multilevel love story many reviewers are saying but wait for the big twist what movie did they see that i apparently missed because there is no big twist in this movie except margot robbie coming out of nowhere to be a costar overall if you like movies like the notebook then youll enjoy this movie if youre looking for a mindbending experience by the likes of primer or coherence you are in for a total shock in the most boring fashion unless youve read my review and moved on ahead of time,happy
i saw this movie with my wife on our anniversarythought it a movie for adults i stand mistakenthis is a film for everyone who knows what it means grow and mature in ones life and can smile about the memory or perhaps the prospectnice normal folks who like each other and carry no psychosis dark childhood etcit reminded me that anyones life can be funny and altogether worth the headaches if one cares to noticecharming actors perfect musicappropriate pacingi would happily give an award to each of the leads for work performedi do not see films twice i may in this casemy dear wife was moved by this work to the point of tears first of laughter later nota film to make adults laugh think remember and warn their children once againan unexpected pleasure,happy
i went to see this movie with a friend with no prior knowledge and was swept away on its storytelling brilliancesure the timetravelling butterfly effect aspect could probably be picked apart in a trice by all those miserable scifi fans blah blah the concept is pure genius and such a refreshing way of examining the human condition and getting under the skin of the characters im a sometimes fan of richard curtis but i think this is definitely the best ever  and i really like love actuallythe acting is brilliant especially domnhall gleeson even bill nighy hits the nail on the head and doesnt go over the top and its a real feel good mix of laughs and tears as well as being a brilliant storylove love love it go and see it today,happy
apparently time travels are one of the keys to success because this movie hit me right in my heart about time touched me in way that no movie has ever touch a simple story about love that has enough strength to make everyone laugh and cry the story of a guy who is unhappy with is life and who discovers a very powerfully gift which will transform his life forever its really hard to say bad things about this film the characters the story the soundtrack and all the details were really good perhaps the best romantic comedy i have ever seen about time accomplishes everything i love about romantic comedies its a compassionate magical and lovely story with a little bit of comedy go and watch this one i promise you wont be disappointed,happy
the spoiler is at the front of this review if you think this is a film about time travel then please dont go and see this film just take a copy of star trek or something and lock yourself in a closet hinthowever if you can come out of the closet a reformed character if you have any kind of soul or a heart you simply have to see this movie again i have to thank my darling wife as per my last review as i thought i would never have wanted to see this film though i saw the trailer and was a little intriguedthe trailer actually though doesnt give you even a tenth of this movies depth or emotional content and if you want to have a good cry at any point then do so but i defy you not to shed a tear at the end im writing this review whilst listening to mark kermodes parallel take on the film via youtube and cannot help but concur  and he cried too  for all the right reasons this film works and on lots and lots of levelsfirstly though  is it a chick film or is it in that cadre alongside field of dreams where actually its a male tale i think definitely the latter but either sex will be certain to claim it as one of their own and the parallels are already starting to appear on the internet it may not have yet the cult status of four weddings and a funeral but frighteningly that film was made almost twenty years ago and the world has moved on i think about time is every bit as good if not better than four weddings and i think and hope over time people will stop making that comparison and respect it for being something quite different and arguably more subtle indeed a little darkersecondly the current comparator on the wiki page is groundhog day yes there are similar themes and tropes in about time but you will warm to the lead characters in about time far more than you will ever do to bill murray and his amusing but acerbic humour so i dont think that this is anything like groundhog or 50 first dates which is groundhog day but sweeter in my view in that sense and plays dare i say much better and a fair bit deeperthird some critics say the film is more like the time travellers wife i caught that for the first time only last week and was lessthanimpressed the story was good but the film itself just left you feeling like an observer on the outside of a physics experiment for me about time is very different and a far better moviethe difference you cannot help but to be drawn into the world that surrounds these characters as its real ever day stuff  late teen angst first and second loves marriage romance children and sadly also death it doesnt get much more real than thatnow apparently this film has opened in the uk first and doesnt hit the us until the start of november the size of the real box office take will only be known once its passed through the us and this is a quintessentially british film after all it has bill nighy again as suggested by mark kermode playing a character playing a character playing bill nighy through lindsay duncan and what seems to be a cast of really great upandcoming british actors and actresses rachel macadams excepted so whether they will get it over the pond remains to be seenbut that doesnt mean its not a wonderful film and if you only get to see one more film this year make it this onei saw four weddings with a then girlfriend and walked out from the cinema knowing that we didnt have the romance that was needed to make it all the way its taken me twenty years as i said but i came out tonight having watched the film with someone who makes me feel like the final words of the film suggest and also that the title about time can be taken in many many waysmaybe it was about time richard curtis did something better than four weddings and for me this is it please see it and make it the hit it deserves to be,happy
we went with free passes and had no idea what this movie was really about and quite low expectations to be honest i highly doubt i would have seen it if i had just based it on the trailer however it was the best movie i have seen in a long time it was certainly a mix of comedy and drama but not the type of predictable sappy love story that are typical of these type of movies the story follows a young man who discovers that he has the ability to travel back in his life he ends up changing some things about his life to make them just right however in the end there are some things he isnt capable of changing more than the timetravel theme is a beautiful portrayal of love at first sight family bonds and the powerful connection between father and son it is touching and sentimental and gives an honest perspective about living life to its fullest each and every daywith lots of humour included as well its not just a chick flick but something that i think guys will equally appreciate dont miss this movie and bring your tissue,happy
excellent screen play and script to exemplify the problems in life and teachings of how to cleverly deal with them the deep thoughts regarding worries and concerns that almost every individual go through in their diurnal life has been demonstrated via amazingly good combo of crave feeling to get first love mistakes resolutions parental love and emotions all the actors truly justified their roles in fact the movie is kinda generic teaching to every individual of the 21st century as to how to lead a happy life each day along with prioritizing the professional tasks how to live life with full zeal and value every little thing that can make you smile and never take any blessings in your life as granted kudos to the creator team,happy
i loved this feature i am big fan of time travel movies and this one will slowly rise up in my list of favorites as time progresses there are two things that stood out in this movie which you dont get to see in a time travel movie first how time travel is not used for something dramatic but for love and family second apart from being a romantic movie this was also a fatherson movie  a relationship that was beautifully explored with a sweet end in that relationship this movie made me think about what i really want in my life my day went wellsweet and simple time travel yet thoughtprovoking,happy
just come back from watching this film i have to say im very impressed not seen a rom com this good in years it has the right balance between humour and sensitive subjects and all over general life at no point in the film do you feel lost as to what is going on it all makes perfect sense rachel mcadams always makes a film in my opinion anyway i was a bit jubious about how good it was set to be but i would highly advise going to see this film its a beautiful well thought out and set film will make you laugh in hysterics and also cry in hysterics also depending how hard you are to crack very good film go see   ,happy
i dont care how may times she changes her hair color at age 35 rachel mcadams is not an insecure ingnueyes i know its acting but still not much better with 30 yr old domhnall gleesoni know this is some 60 yr old producers idea of a meetcute romanticcomedy with a bankable name but come on besides as someone has already pointed out rachel has about exhausted the timetravel paramour romanticcomedy already  sag registries overflow with good age appropriate actors get some now,happy
the most touching sweet and full of emotions movie one of the best movies i ever seen although the story has science fiction elements the real story is about happiness about the important and unimportant details of our every day life how easy it is to be fooled and not live our lives to the fullest its a story of a dad confessing to his son the meaning of life and the secret of happiness this movie is so romantic like love actually funnier than four weddings and a funeral and so much more i certainly put it in my top five list of best movies in the end i was so touched ready to cry concluding i believe there should be more movies like that since they are a brilliant example of the impact a movie can have in ones life,happy
i love watching moviesi have seen a whole lot of movies but there are only few movies in my life that have so impacted it this movie can be described as the movie which can impact anyones way of thinking and living and yes the directors intention of showcasing the importance of life could be clearly felt by the viewer it feels really good to review such a movie i loved the movie so very muchso much that i am reviewing it at 3 in the nightit would be really bad if i wouldnt review this movie before sleeping yes this movie definitely has made me move around its concept of living life i wish that everyone must watch this movie because its like a complete package a whole lot of my emotions have been touched by this movie thanks mrrichard curtis for exceptional story and direction,happy
making a film about timetraveling is opening a can of worms ive seen almost every film out there about time travel some are very accurate and some are a complete mess this one is somewhere in between they introduce the concept very casually to the characters in the film who arent smart enough to ask certain questions about the rules concerning the consequences and changes it might causei get that this movie is first and foremost a romantic movie and time travel is only a device to prove a point but at the same time it can be a bit distracting if it doesnt work 100 in the first half of the film the protagonist comes of as a bumbling idiot who unrightfully uses time travel to correct his impulsive mistakes which would have been easily corrected if he just used his brain before speaking it seems questionable in that way if he even deserves to have this power to force things to go his way domhnall gleeson is maybe not the best choice of actor here rachel mcadams does a much better job she is instantly likable but her character seems to be written without much depth it might seem like a bad movie judging but my rant here but actually if you look past the aforementioned shortcomings it is entertaining and the 2 hrs will fly by in no time,happy
heart warmingengaging and humorous though not laugh out loud a movie that opens your mind to possibilities and a deeper sense of gratitude for the simple things in life although on an emotional level its not a tear jerker this is mainly due to the casts ability to deliver some deep messages and keep the atmosphere light at the same time the script is written with the irony of life woven through the depths of the story enabling a deeper sense of humor to shine each performer delivered solid performances i enjoy british films and serials acting is still an art and actors are still artists and british productions always out shine the americans watch this movie and im sure youll feel good after,happy
i have used imdb for many years to find those movies that get pushed aside and unfortunately forgotten and they almost always prove to be worth the time but i have never been moved to review a film as much as i have for about time this movie didnt make me cry it didnt make me angry and it didnt leave me wondering but it most certainly made me genuinely smile the story gathers in so many aspects of life and presents them in a way in which we can plainly see and understand the message it doesnt waste time in the complexities of time travel but rather focuses on the importance of the lesson this film has a love story with the quirkiness of a wes anderson film mixed with the serendipity of 500 days of summer just when it feels complete it morphs out of love right into family tragedy and all the rest of lifes challenges and gifts i believe this movie truly encompasses what we should look for for ourselves in everyday life and reaches to exceed the superficiality of most stories we encounter today,happy
this was a downright surprise we have not seen it comingthis movie is humble in appearance but what a punch it delivers it is about love about time and about living every moment of your life as extraordinary as possible no matter what mundane thing you are doing i urge you to watch it with an open mind do not build your expectations too high or too low just watch it as it is pure artbe amazed and cherish for a moment the emotions it will unravel in youthe way the director has put in motion this screenplay is an artistic expression of what is most beautiful and most human in uslove i loved the performance of both domhnall gleeson and bill nighy outstanding,happy
a movie like about time only comes along every so often it is a sleeper of a movie that emerged on the scene without fuss however despite this it is so special that it really can change the way you think the movie centres on the character tim domhnall gleeson who is awkward lacking in confidence but absolutely adorable to those who allow him to get too close to them tim discovers that he can time travel when he turns twentyone and begins what he calls an extraordinary ordinary life the film is beautiful funny and heartbreakingly honest gleeson is irresistible in his portrayal of tim but billy nighy who plays tims dad is also outstanding i wont say too much more because the strength of this movie is you literally do not know where it is going i suggest that you see it but save it for a special occasion there arent too many movies around that are this good,happy
as a story that involves time travel about time doesnt even follow its established time travel rules the most impressive part of it is the movie is so charming with human warmth none of that even mattersi found myself not even caring about the broken rules in fact to be honest i was so charmed and immersed into the story and characters i did not notice the rules were broken long after the movie was over plot hole zealots will have a ball nitpicking this film to oblivion but those who do will completely miss the films point curtis interest doesnt lie in science fiction spectacle the time travel explanation itself is as unscientific as it getscurtis priorities lie upon human matters which brings me to the characters the film is well casted as a romantic lead domhall gleeson has an everyman quality that believably would have struggles dating women thats a common complaint i have with a lot of romantic comedies generally glesson seems like a normal bloke whose charm needs time to grow on someone as opposed to being immediately charming with practiced swagger rachel mcadams is adorable and shows good comic timing shes played a similar role before in morning glory which was one of my favorites that year again unlike a lot of romance stories mcadams allure doesnt hang solely on her beauty the mary character is smart funny and an interesting person more importantly she is the type of the girl one would marry and take home to your parentsbill nighy is curtiss secret ingredient and is the heart of the film its a subtle minimalist performance as if nighy played the scenes as honestly as he could without adding any character quirks or anything an actor would do to purposely chew up the scenery nighy is an amicable presence is effortlessly hilarious with his deliveries and inflections of every piece of dialogue hes giventheres also a great cast of supporting characters that cover a variety of character quirks that i dont even want to spoil here they all have their little arcs and i think its probably a better experience to discover them while youre watching the filmthe main point is that richard curtis used time traveling as a metaphor to say something profound about life he captures moments of lifes joy and sadness in doing so the film is more than the sum of its parts i was warmed by curtis optimistic view of life and the sincere message he conveyed in about time for a guy that doesnt cry at movies i can say that other people will by the films end heck i probably would have enjoyed it more if i could roll a tearthis is probably the one of the best movies i have seen this year if it doesnt stay on my top ten by the end of 2013 it would be very surprisingfor more reviews please visit my film blog  httphkauteurwordpresscom,happy
curtis goes out with a bang with this highly witty creation his usual formula remains well intact  middle class families personality winning out over good looks vulnerable friend or relative slightly bumbling delivery weddings funerals and several laugh out loud momentsi initially thought the time travel bit being the key to the movie would be the bit that disappointed me but it didnt a better description which no other review i have spotted mentioned is that it is as though the soul or the mind transports back in time into the body that was there already  hence why he cannot change history he could though just not history he wasnt alive to see the flaw in this argument is that the body in the past seems to suddenly move into a cupboard but this is a flaw in the script not in his concept of how the time travel bit is meant to workthe only bit that didnt sit easy was the way it came across that he was stalking or manipulating the women to ensure they melted into his arms overhear a friend talking go back in time then pretend you are interested in the same thing the whole resulting relationship would be based on a lie which didnt sit easythere were two saving graces to this one is that the hero was portrayed as fundamentally decent and respectable despite the above time travel voyeurism two is that the resulting relationship originally resulted from a meeting not involving time travel  a literal blind date he was thus only correcting what he had inadvertently messed up in the first placeall in all a great movie with some great philosophical messages relevant even to those of us without a quantum engine built into our bodies watch it because there wont be another one  unless curtis himself goes back in time and changes his mind,happy
richard curtiss about time which the director has claimed will be his last film is a heart warming experience curtis brought us notting hill and love actually and many similarities can be found in his latest project21 year old tim domhnall gleeson is shocked when his father bill nighy tells him all the men in his family can travel through time but only with in their own life he need only find a small dark space concentrate on the time he wishes to travels to what seems at first to be a priceless gift becomes more complex as time goes onthe father and son relationship between gleeson and nighy is heart warming and superbly executed tom hollander plays harry a old acquaintance of tims father and play writer who reluctantly gives tim a room in his house while hes living in london after moving from his family home in cornwall  lydia wilson plays tims sister kit kat who has a close bond with her brother rachael mc adams plays mary tims girlfriend who he meets in the dans le noir a restaurant where people eat in the dark lindsay duncan who plays tims mother is talent wasted and is constantly a spare part about time provides charming humour and like curtiss previous works is a film about love and family but also the relationship of a father and son which will send everyone who watches it on a emotional roller coaster of what we all call life,happy
i am a massive fan of love actually and i like four weddings and a funeral so my expectations are quite high for curtis latest work perhaps this is why i was a little bit disappointedit seems that the main character tim was living in a rather perfect world loving and harmonious family happy childhood nice job beautiful wife 3 adorable kids almost trouble and worryfree sister kit kats problem was easily fixed and a man was ready and around for her he did not quite need to struggle for anything in life everything was just so smooth and too good to be true quite a lot of lines are well written but to a fan of richard curtis certain conversations can be quite typical expected and sometimes rather cheesy,happy
this film is definitely going into my top films the things i loved about the film was the emotion put into it that the characters gave and portrayed excellently the story for me was great and it would touch anyone who saw it this is a really funny film as well as giving soft emotions when i first saw the trailer the film looked good when i watched it it was excellent zooey deschanel was meant to be playing the role of the main character which i think she wouldve done great in but rachel mcadams was just the best choice for this i love her because shes just a brilliant actor there was one thing that didnt really make it interesting was there was no climax to the film until the end when he had to make that sacrifice for a new child or his father that bit was really sad and emotional having to tell his dad that that would be the last time ever to see him it was such a great film and you should recommend this to all your friends,happy
theres a lot to like about this movie it has a slightly nostalgic feel to it whilst still being very current the protagonists family are quirky idiosyncratic and all dote on each other theres a batty old uncle an academic yet devoted father an independent yet loving mother a brother and sister who never fight but adore each other halcyon days spent growing up in a crumbling old mansion house in cornwall picnicking on the beach in all weathers then the boy turns 21 and discovers at a new year party that the men in the family all have the ability to travel back in time cue some hilarious moments in which the boy dots back and forth in time revisiting moments he didnt quite get right the first time so that he can have another crack at them he marries has a baby daughter and then his sister is badly hurt in a car accident back in time he pops and the accident never happens however when he returns to present time his baby daughter has transformed into a baby son because it seems that when you alter something in the past you get a different future deciding he cant live without his precious daughter he goes back again and makes the accident happen his sister has to go through the pain of rehabilitation which of course she does with her brothers support then the boys father develops cancer needless to say hes been time travelling for years extending his own life effectively but now hes ready to die but thats cool because the son can keep travelling back in time to see him whenever he wants however after the fathers funeral the sons wife says she wants another baby the son realises if they do this then hell have to choose between seeing his father and risking the baby changing into someone else he chooses the baby and goes back to visit his father one last time the two of them have a golden day revisiting a walk theyd taken when the son was about ten down on the beach then say their goodbyes the film ends with the son realising you have to live in the moment instead of worrying about time travel what disappointed me about the film was the lack of dramatic tension even the whole fatherson dilemma was more poignant than stressful and there was never really a point where i felt yikes what will he choose to do had the sister been killed in that car crash and the protagonist had to choose between saving his sisters life and keeping the same baby he and his wife had i cant help feeling it would have carried a bit more weight its hard to believe this came from the same stable as love actually where we had plenty of tragedy along with the comedy  the guy who was in love with his best friends wife the sister with the institutionalised brother who wasnt free to fall in love the wife with the erstwhile philandering husband all in all just a bit too saccharinesweet for my taste,happy
i was a little skeptical at the premise of this movie but i have a lot of faith in richard curtis and took a chance on this movie i am so happy i did i am not a huge follower of romantic comedy movies although love actually same director of course is easily one of my all time favorites hands downand like his other movie richard curtis created a film with such a perfect cast and a story so happy and so sad that i admit it often brings me almost to tears one thing that carries this movie is an exceptional cast i am a firm believer bill nighy could very well be one of the best actors of our timethe story is so well done that i have seen it multiple times and each time i feel like i get a little more emotion out of it there are a few movies i can see over and over again because once the credits roll no matter what the day has brought i just feel good this is one of those movies,happy
even though the story with tim and mary is a lovely not too overly done love story the one relationship which shines through is that between tim and his father it is the most beautiful film i have ever seen and makes you feel grateful100 recommend to anyone who wants to watch a feel good film which will hopefully change how you look at life in a more positive light,happy
that movie has some serioud nietschze philosophy embedded inside,happy
as a man in my early twenties romcoms are my guilty pleasure i like them i really do and ive watched really bad ones and still liked them whether it was for their relatable characters or their main cast theres almost always something positive i can cling to even in the bad romcoms but this one was too much while the gist of the story would theoretically make for a good movie gigantic plot holes illogical use of the main characters time traveling ability and the incredibly dumb that painfully cringe inducing kinda dumb not the cute kinda dumb behavior of the main character make this unwatchable for mei realize im not necessarily the target audience but i would recommend staying away from this even if you are,happy
this movie has the potential to change your perspective towards life if you learn from itthis is a very straighrforward movie with a huge message about how to life your life without any regretsi wish i could have seen it earlier in time,happy
this movie is so heartwarming that you wish it never have ended it its one of my favorites but very much underrated i wish more people watch this movie,happy
this movie is lovely and very bitter for me as i couldnt do the trick in it so my mary raises her two kids with the other bloke the one significant detail the one eventually tim lefts behind at the end is the solution to happinessalthough happiness can be found in many ways of course as this is shown in the movie too bill nighy is the total winner again with his fantastic humour and humanity but the rest is beautiful as well i think its enough watch it be happy either you could do the cupboard trick or not i dare you,happy
im a giant richard curtis fan and i totally ignored the fact almost time had alluded me i finally made time for this very unpredictable story narrative it is honestly something i did not expect this film has so much heart but i expect general film fans may mistake this concept for a rom com the misdirection might annoy the casual fan but if you go in with no expectations this film will deliver a twist on the genre and reward you with a heartfelt film good film and worth watching,happy
i liked it easy viewing with an incredible love story at the heart of it  but not between the people the promotion material would have you believe,happy
the best film ive ever seen for hopeless romantics like me youre feeling down watch this film youre felling stressed watch this film this is definitely the best film in my opinion ever made and holds a special place in my heart,happy
this isnt the sort of film i would usually choose to watch but i found myself bored with a few hours to spare and decided to give it a go im very glad that i didthis is just a generally nice film throughout some of the scenes i found myself smiling  it was just a nice film the plot is quite interesting and makes for quite a good storythere were a few instances where the time traveling bit got slightly confusing to the end  for instance when he and his father go back to when he was a little kid hes not supposed to know about time travel until he is 21 as he isnt able to do it until he turns 21 so how does his father explain why hes taking him into a dark closet to take him back to the future there is a bit of a plot hole here that wasnt explained very welloverall this film is quite good and is worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to spare,happy
the best thing about time is the story written by richard curtis  how hes gracefully put story into film and create one of best romantic drama no doubt film is based on scifi idea of a person going back in time and undo the changes or try to make things right  but when you watch youre never thought of any scifi move or a time machine  the script is crafted and scene natural and pleasurable to watch its fun to watch the leading pair in the film domhnall gleeson and rachel mcadams play her character nicely especially domhnall who play the role of tim and learnt from her father that how to going back in time and used it wisely to make a girlfriend  save her sister from her past mistakes  richard curtis prove that hes a terrific storyteller and director i love the editing of film its just match exactly the rhythm of script  the best scene of mine is were he done sex with her girlfriend mary and every time hes just go back in time and try to improve her sex timing with her  every one in the film played her part very well like tims father bill nighy  and tims sister lydia wilson  and in last word if you like to go in our past time then go once for about time ,happy
about time is a really good movie that manages to deliver a message and touch feelings someone noted here that this is the reason we go to see movies and taking about time as a whole i totally agree i was moved and this feeling is still with me as i write and i know ill watch it againnow for the technical side about time is a light comic drama with a good heart from the very start one can see the good production values very good narrative performances and cinematography however it also introduces some awkwardness primarily due to the awkward off bit characters including tim in fact most of the male characters through the movie are such and this is a bit of a down side at start it reminds very much of groundhog day but somewhere along the way it takes its own direction and groundhog day is forgotten it is not always engaging but for its above 2 hours length it has a very good pace narrative and performances and never boring for its last part it starts to be engaging and very movingabout time has some drawbacks first are the already mentioned off bit characters i think they were made such to add a comic side but it mostly felt a bit out of place however this wasnt too severe not in terms of screen time nor in its intensity the second was some of the occurrences tim decided to change he seemed to be quite smart so understanding the major risks and outcomes of changing the past shouldnt be too hard instead he makes a mistake of changing events too far in time more than once which makes him a bit less likablehowever nothing is flawless and like a person this movie has its own drawbacks and while theyre visible they are outweighed by far by its benefits about time succeeds in getting the best emotions from ourselves making us think of how we can improve our lives being us but looking at things from a slightly different point of view and just for this i would recommend it as a must watch,happy
what a waste of potential what a waste this movie is nothing more just 2 hours of dull and boring cinema with almost no plot at all the story is absolutely about nothing it stars promising but then you wait 2 hours that something happens but nothing interesting happens you dont care of any of the characters because they are so flat so empty there is no tension no emotion when there is an problem it is immediately solved by traveling back in time how convenientas someone mentioned here how can someone with time travel powers still remain such a pathetic loser whole movie is pathetic and boring this movie is big disappointment,happy
im amazed this film has garnered as many high scores as it has because it fails as a romance and fails in its timetravel premisetimetravel rarely works well in anything and the viewer often has to not think too hard and just go with it but the mechanics this film chooses to use simply dont make sense if he went back in time into the mind of his younger self okay i could have bought it as in the butterfly effect but for his timetravelling self to appear as a separate entity in a wardrobe or other space makes no sense whats supposed to have happened to the original him in the time he travels back to for example he goes back to the new years party first thing what if at the point he travels back he was in a crowded room what happens to him that him just pops out of existence and suddenly he comes downstairs from the cupboard like a bad magician on a talent show and when he goes back in the cupboard to travel back then what wheres the rest of him from the time he just left waking up in a cupboard wondering how he got thereit makes no sense and romance dont make me laugh its so creepy to think he went back to his loveofhislifes apartment for the first time their first time together happens three times for him but only once for her so what she thinks was their first time was his third time theyd done the deed this doesnt strike anyone as disturbing and he lies and manipulates those closest to him all his life changing things to suit him and only him how romanticoh but wait  he does suddenly try to take his sister back  succeeds  but then because it alters his life in a way he doesnt like though dramatically altering hers  nah forget that sis go get hit by a car  you brought it all on yourself anyway not having you upsetting my perfect idyla horrible film and a nonsense concept i wish i could go back in time and never watch this garbage again,happy
boring to a fault great imdb ratings led me to believe this may have been a great premise used well however right from the first massive plot defect where the lead male could simply have returned in time to get the girls phone number again and yet did not and the plot got terribly stupid and clich the entire thing began falling like a badly stacked deck of cards relying on clich after clich and the most unremarkable dull lives with something poorly mimicking wit to attempt to keep it all afloat not to mention that after the wedding when all the guests get soaked to the skin we see them apparently minutes later in the reception perfectly dry silly silly movie trying to have depth and to shove the same lines of live life to the fullest at us under the premise of actually being a story about livingstunning scenery very good actors the whole thing looked wonderful and could have lasted 30 minutes and actually been interesting i was so bored and horrified that people may actually live these kind of hum drum predictable existences a safe dull pretence,happy
i like movies about time travel but this is full of flaws more than others first how did he know that he can take other persons with him did i miss something and when he took his sister to her past and she changed it they jumped backforward into the present and both new immediately what changed his wife asked him what happened in the past but how could she as the old time line does not exist anymore and in the new time line he had no need to travel back then when he realized that his daughter turned into a boy how did he undo what had changed the new time line was already in place so would he take his now happy sister to the past again and as she knows the old and the new time line she would act the same way as in the first time travel or did he return on his own then he would have met himself or did the travel back replace him with his other self and he strangely  in the eyes of his sister  changes his mind and just says nothing as another writer mentioned if he always comes out in his cupboard what happens with him in that past does he just disappear and what would happen if that cupboard didnt exist in that pastwhen he visits his father in the past in his living room why did his father know that he time traveled didnt he ever meet his father in that time line the normal waywhen he visits his father for the last time we can hear his father and him play table tennis as he just exits the cupboard and then the camera jumps to both playing so he existed twice for some secondsin this scene his father acts as if he would never see his son again but that is not true because tim in that time line lives his normal life does his dad ever tell him that he will visit him in the future obviously not because otherwise tim would know that he visits his father before he does itthat is the big problem of impossible time travel you change the memories of yourself when you tell someone in the past about you and he tells it to your other self so you must have that information before you even change the past the same thing as killing your grand pa the film back to the future handled this paradox in a more elegant way as the people really existed more than once in that time lines and so they could change their own behavior,happy
this isnt the first occasion ive seen about time indeed i caught it back at the cinema and was won over by it its sweet charm and english whimsybut this time i dont know came away feeling like id been manipulated emotionally by it i was ready to be enchanted all over again by a feel good movie but instead i found myself not liking the main character tim very much at all compensating for his life mistakes by erasing them and having another go no one gets this we all mess up from time to time and its the learning from those moments that defines us but not tim he just gets to do it all over again right this time or perhaps not as his wooing of rachel mcadams character came across as more than a little creepy i get that were supposed to think its okay essentially innocent his quoting back lines to her about kate moss in an attempt to worm his way into her affections oh look its that nice slightly awkward yet wholesome english lad isnt that lovely well no not really and i found myself remembering elijah wood using bits of kate winslets stolen memories in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind as a less honourable attempt at courtship which appropriately she sees right through if you dont buy into all that which i didnt on this occasion then the rest comes crashing down the supporting characters are nearly all so onedimensional that you can sum them up in a single word  sister kit kat scatty rory embarrassing harry rude etc again nobody in reality is like this but that level of complexity doesnt fit in with the film so the characters are defined by their singleword stereotypes i still have feeling for it though entirely because of the bill nighy character tims dad as with the rest of about time fathers arent as perfect as he is i know i am one but the sweet natured relationship between tim and his dad hes even credited on the cast list as dad just about saves it still a pleasant surprise to have this element in the film and it gets to me every time,happy
the movie had a lot of potential possibilities except they just used it to give a message live every day giving your best by enjoying it which is of course good but they did not need a scifi setting and waste that the start is promising as we see tim has a gift to go back in time and change it tim uses it to his advantage so he goes on to impress a girl by getting to know her first time and acting as per her likes next time he uses this in every scenario to impress her in first part we get to see how once tim travels to same time and goes to another place his earlier actions go on missing erasing that time line this point was reiterated throughout showing how tim could never change some things however we never get to see this point into a big drama point tim sees his father dying and he still travels back to meet him which he can never do once his child is born the moment that he has to let go of his fathers memory which he revisits was poignant and handled well however at the end the movie feels incomplete as if a half baked cake with a promising setting but a gone opportunity,happy
review this is quite a heart warming story about a teenager who has the ability to travel back in time as the main character is able to correct his mistakes in life he manages to find the lady of his life but he is a able to correct every problem in his life personally i think that they could have picked a better leading character because i was unable to relate to the one that the director had chosen apart from that is great writing and there is enough material to keep the storyline interesting in some ways it seemed more like a chick flick even though the main character was a boy anyway its worth a watch but dont expect anything different from richard curtisroundup im really becoming a bill nighy fan because of his way of acting and the way that he can make any situation funny tom hallander was quite funny and rachel mcadams was a great choice for her role she seems to add a sweetness to all of the roles which out shone the leading character who did have much screen charisma but i think that was a deliberate choice by the director anyway its true family fun but its not a classic like love actually or notting hillbudget na worldwide gross 86millioni recommend this movie to people who are into there time travel movie about a teenager trying to correct his mistakes throughout his life 610,happy
maybe its because im getting older and more mature or is it simply because its a perfect movie  i put all my money on the second guess because in the end i found it an amazing and captivating romantic comedy  normally i hate movies containing the combination of romance and humor usually the humor is of a questionable level and it threatens to become a corny tearjerker with a predictable happy ending where everyone is happily married actually all of that is in this movie  but not on a grotesquely sentimental level as in other chick flicks  like someone said on imdb  a chick flick for men occasionally i have to listen to my wife and select a movie which will lead to a cozy movie night she can enjoy instead of watching again at some nerve wrecking bloody and violent sf or thriller with much reluctance i try to look for that kind of movie the thing that convinced me to choose for about time was the sf label it got  ultimately the sf part is essential for the whole story but it is not the crucial element which leaves a lingering impression its just a great movie where you get sucked in from the beginning and you feel like youre in the center of the story tim has a gift that all men possess in his family  he can go back in time  not to change kill hitlershag helen of troy  world history only situations occurring in his personal life he can change he wants to use that gift to find the love of his lifeit has immensely funny situations and humorous conversations  i laughed at this film more than any wouldbe comedy that i have seen in recent months those funny situations that happen are so recognizable and pure nothing forced no complicated puns or fetched trivialities  the conversation in the dark restaurant run by blind people  who came up with that their first night and the way tim returns again and again in time  the frustrations tim shows while helping mary to choose an evening dress i understood him perfectlymeeting marys parents  the oneliners that passed from time to timethe awkward friends like jay and rory  uncle d who was moving in a certain way  but at the same time hilarious every time my wife and i laughed about it its enormously romantic god yes you get that in a romantic comedy  but its that romance that also occurs infinite times in real life and not the romance you read in cheap pulp magazines sometimes it was brought subtle tim could easily use his gift to have a hot night with charlotte finally he says no to that thought and runs back to mary to ask her to marry him a symbolic way to show that mary is his true love  the scene with the live band was also hilarious the film also has its emotional moments  these are the moments where the sticker  beware of irritating objects in the eye applies to the relationship with his father gets gradually warmer and caring the concerns about his sister kit kat  the death of his father and the special way he definitively says goodbye serene catchy and stunning the casting is perfect each character feels like a real individual and fits into the complete picture  both physically and mentally tim is a daydreaming  sometimes awkward but sensitive guy  domhnall gleeson delivers a magnificent performance  i didnt recognize him as bill weasley of the potter series  and even as clan techie from dredd  rachel mcadams who plays mary is a natural beauty and a charm throughout the film  bill nighy puts a rocksolid portrait of the father who struggles with his feelings towards his son lindsey duncan has no big part in this movie but each time she comes into the picture she has the look of a caring mother honestly  there wasnt a single character that i found weak finally the soundtrack is also worth a mention  songs of the cure  amy winehouse  nick cave and ben folds were a splendid contribution to the overall mood ive always liked movies i watch movies because i want a relaxing moment  a moment to laugh or bite my nails cause of the tension or nearly get a heart attack from scaring  or sympathize with certain events and sometimes cry a little bit about it  those are the reasons to watch a movie and that i found in this movie  my advice is to just give this one a chance and let yourself be carried away on a sentimental and funny rollercoaster ride of emotionsmore reviews at meningvanfilmfreakblogspotbe,happy
richard curtis the director and writer of about time is a wellknown screenwriter whose most famous scripts include those for the bridget jones movies for love actually and for notting hill  so you kind of know what to expect from him already a cute and funny romantic comedy but no oscar bait about time i think tries to be something more than a romantic comedy and in a way it manages to do so its not only about a relationship between a man and a woman there is also the love for family members unfortunately this movie fails in creating any drama  its more like watching a compilation of images from someones life  and in this aspect it should have just sticked to the romantic comedy genretim domhnall gleeson lives an almost ideal life with his almost perfect family the only thing hes missing is a girlfriend but when his father bill nighy on tims 21st birthday reveals to him that all male members of their family can travel back in time he decides to use this ability to find a girlfriend he moves to london gets a job and meets mary rachel mcadams with whom he falls in love one evening in a caf he discovers that changing the course of events by going back in time has major consequences not all of which are pleasant therefore he must decide what is more important and realise that the ability to travel back in time perhaps isnt that much of an advantageits impossible not to notice similarities with other movies especially with the anime the girl who leapt through time but thats a good thing the main problem with this movie like i already said is the fact that there is no real story no drama no problems that last till the end of the movie and our heroes have to resolve for example after he finds mary and gets her number he has to go back in time to help a friend  and ends up never meeting her this story his searching for the girl of his dreams could have been stretched out to last an hour and a half but instead the issue is resolved in ten minutes and the movie goes on for more than an hour the main characters sister kit kat lydia wilson is the only one who has constant issues she needs to resolve but her role is too marginal to be really relevantthe main problem i just explained might as well be the movies best quality it is just a collection of segments from someones life and almost every segment is positive which makes it more a therapy than a movie most of the time while watching about time youll find yourself laughing and feeling happy and once you exit the theater youll probably feel satisfied with the life youre leading  which is the message of the movie the actors the cinematography and the music help with that the cast is talented the scenery beautiful and mostly shows sunny days or calm nights one may argue that the movie is too idealistic that nobody leads such an awesome life in reality my opinion is that its not about what happens to you its about how you handle it and the characters in about time handle it very wellrating 710 read more at httppasspopcorncom,happy

for me there is no getting around the fact that it just feels wrong for rachel mcadams to be in a film so undeniably similar to her previous film the time travelers wife that just is what it ishowever even though it feels a bit derivative in plot and pushes the bounds of even timetravel logic here and there this film gets at least a 7580 rating from me on the strength of the story that is being told and what a purely beautiful takeaway it givesit is not really about time travel it is about relationships but not in a saccharine runofthemill way mcadams is unbelievably cute of course but domhnall gleeson is absolutely brilliant as the lead character and the entire cast is superbi wont drone onabout time is one of the sweetest mostly beautiful most inspiring films that i have seen in a long time it does not take its highconcept premise too seriously which is a good thing but it takes the characters and their humanity and their connections to each other very seriously  which is to say that it has real emotional weight  also a very good thing better than it looks like it will be from a distance just tearfully gorgeous up close and thus it gets my recommendation,happy
with the holidays come up and many changes in my life i was looking for something a little on the lighthearted side and came across this title i didnt even watch the preview just saw that it was a rachel mcadams comedy drama so i said what the heck ill throw caution to the wind and go off to the sunday matine glad i did pleasantly surprised charming and endearing story great lovable cast it was just what i need to lift my spirits for a couple hours glad to see its getting good ratings a lot times cutesy comedy dramas get over looked well done look forward to more like this it reminded of a forest gump meets noting hill story highly recommend,happy

wouldnt this be a great world says albert brooks as the somewhat average and completely smitten aaron altman in broadcast news if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive if needy were a turnon if that kind of world sounds interesting then about time is your cup of english tea and despite the casting of popular american actress rachel mcadams this is as quirkybritishindie as youre gonna get this year anyhow the quirk king himself bill nighy plays an important supporting role  especially when he tells his son the films regular guyunderdog hero a lanky clumsy neurotic passiveaggressive 21year old redhead tim that they have the ability to go back not forward in time to change the course of personal events so if something goes awry you can quickly make it bettersounds a lot like the time travelers wife combined with groundhog day but its more sliding doors meets any romcom where the main character does all they can to keep true love alivetims interests with this new power has nothing to do with making money or changing the world he simply wants a girlfriend some of the best scenes occur before mcadams as american import mary enters the picture tim tries to politely beddown his sisters gorgeous best friend and after learning a thing or two about fate and getting lucky and how the two dont always mix the primary romance beginstim meets mary during a matchup date and without giving too many clever twists away things dont always go as planned he uses time travel no machine needed you just stand inside an enclosed room clench your fists and close your eyes tight to alter sporadic events ranging from his new relationship to helping a friends stage play to choosing the right best manthe downpoints are that the characters including tim and his artistic family are a tad overcontented and unrealistically cozy sometimes writerdirector richard curtis tugs too tightly on the heartstrings and eventually by the somewhat overlong conclusion theres a feeling the time travel aspect was a mere plot device to serve up a clichd existential themebut for a worthy alternative to big budget comic book movies and any sort of mainstream hollywood romance this is a date flick that should benefit either party,happy
watching the preview for this movie i knew it wouldnt result into how many points i would score watching this with my wife it would be more than that it definitely was the awkwardness of the main characters in the beginning transformed into a love story to a brother saving his little sister to a father and son relationship for the ages not just your average romantic comedy here but a film with a message live every moment as if it were your last ending in a scene that will bring field of dreams to tears well doneoverall gentleman if you are being drug to one movie let it be this one you both will be pleasantly surprised with about time,happy
about time is one film that when you watch you see it as a scifi type fairy tale with themes of love and living happily ever after yet underneath it all the picture has much more though it may be a little short on reality with the theme of traveling back in time still enough love life and passion with chance and circumstance is present to make the film a real winner and its spice and sugar is just nice with some sexy scenes of rachel mcadams wearing very sexy multi colored bras set in england timdomhnall gleeson21 a young man who struggles with finding love finds out one day after a new years party from his fatherbill nighythat all of the men in his family have the gift of traveling back in time and this special power can be reached by simply going away in a little room and closing both fist tight and wishing and picturing to go back in time the direction from richard curtis is so brilliant the way he mixes it up with finding love and he proves that life is about chance and circumstance its so good that tim can go back in time to change the bad things and make them all good and thru this time travel tim is able to change his biggest shortfall and thats finding love going back in time to the night of the party he takes it back to meet a young sweet but insecure cute lady an american named marythe sexy rachel mcadams now that life chance and circumstance has been corrected the two fall in love with hot passion and sex the best scenes are tim going back in time over and over so he can continue to make love better each time with mary until hes just so tired he cant anymore plus it was nice seeing mcadams sport that sexy black multi colored bra as each film that rachel is in she shows more and more of herself in sexy colored bras thru it all life love and family and happiness occurs with time travel back to the past correcting the bad hard to believe it all still about time is a touching film that shows every minute of life love time and family is to be enjoyed because time is short always make the most of it this is one film to make the time to see,happy
i knew i needed to see this movie because i freaking cried at the trailer the trailer how embarrassing gone are the days when i can make it through a movie or a trailer with dry eyes at what age does that change have i turned into a complete hopeless romantic tim and his father the sensational bill nighy go into any dark place clench their fists oddly enough in power rangers fashion and choose the place they wish to travel to while tim cant necessarily change his history he can certainly fix the bad decisions he has made along the way just by the concept alone i was already hooked who wouldnt want to have opportunities for a redo or many for that matter check out why we would see this movie again and again httpbitly1gyrk9j,happy
tim has found out the secrets at the age of 21 tim and his first decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend and the processes which he chose to take and how his friends and family were affected in his choices the story line has a few great twists and wake up calls for the audiences there are slight reminders to the people of how we live the experience which tim takes and the awareness which is shown on screen has thoughts which many think but hardly express i found this movie funny moving and leaves you with great thoughts on you own life and how you live it i recommend this movie for many to watch more than once to see the little life meanings which are there right on screen for the audiences notes for their own lives and ways of living,happy
well i am actually against those movies which are completely based on emotional abuse as if they are telling the story of true love however this one is really different simplicity and naturalness in this movie are making pure love and ideal family relations much more attractive despite the fact that these are the issues that have been handled in a very stereotypical and boring manner in other films so fari gotta admit that i went to cinema with low expectations but this film not just surprised me but it has also broke down my prejudices about those films i must add that it is a touching film in a sense that love is not just the thing that happens between a couple but it is also the thing that any person may feel towards someone in hisher family the scenes of table tennis matches or skimming stones with father were actually emphasizes how important little memories are and how it makes us feel loving towards a special person it was so striking,happy
the writerdirector of about time richard curtis was born in new zealand to australian parents as a boy he moved all around the world but is now firmly established in england he has worked predominantly as a screenwriter on some of the most successful british romantic comedies ever made including four weddings and a funeral notting hill and bridget joness diary his transnational upbringing could be an influence on why these films sometimes have americans cast in the lead roles having an international star also offers a bigger boxoffice ticket in the us market with julia roberts notting hill became a financial milestone in british cinema speculation has mounted this could also be curtis last film as director which would account for the films ruminations on life fulfilmentabout time uses a similar casting formula with canadian rachel mcadams in a lead role but in spite of some big laughs the film is letdown by a middling underdeveloped script perhaps if someone else had helmed the film richard curtis could have refined some of the rough edges of the screenplay particularly its boggy second half and the rather ambitious time travel aspects this is disappointing because up till then the film is engaging and funny partly due to the likable casting of domhnall gleeson the son of irish actor brendan gleeson he plays tim a young man told by his father bill nighy that all the men in his family can time travel he can only return to things that have already happened though leading to some funny encounters involving a new years eve party and a summer spent at home with his sister and her friend charlotte australian margot robbie who he tries to court theres no reasoning as to why the men can time travel but the device is used comically returning to the same scene upholds and repeats the gag making it funnier and sometimes with surprising results too some of the cracks in the screenplay coincide with the arrival of mary mcadams tim first meets her on a blind date but after he travels back in time to repair something he loses her number this means that he must introduce himself to her again at an art gallery but as a stranger when he starts telling her things that he couldnt possibly know hes been to the future the comedy verges ever slightly towards the creepy side rachel mcadams has a glowing presence on screen and shares easy relaxed chemistry with gleeson one of the faults in the script though is that no matter how likable her company mary lacks dimensions and a complete inner life outside of tim she is a reader for a publishing company but we little of her work life for example her parents are uptight american conservatives but only feature for a single gag scene comparatively tim has multiple friends a housemate a progressive job as a lawyer a troubled sister and genuine concern for his dad once the central relationship blossoms early around the halfway mark the narrative is left with very little dramatic thrust there is a turning point when tim is reintroduced to charlotte but the film opts to completely sidestep a potentially devastating source of conflict gaps in the logic of the time travel are never resolved either tim never has the problem of meeting himself when reliving moments and the rules about what can be altered and what cant are changed to suit the script pap messages about taking life one day at a time make up the final quarter of a film that is unjustifiably two hours long although its rarely short of being breezy and sometimes very funny the films lasting impression is one of a good idea that just needed longer development or a more objective view of the project,happy
i had expectations from the trailer that this would be a tale of a protagonist that had some social shortcomings and how time travel would help him overcome them to fall in loveinstead the movie appeared to be a quest by our protagonist to appear smooth and suave with women in manufactured relationship our protagonist tim pursues two young womengirls in the film one was puppy love that never comes to fruition and the other was completely manufactured by the time travel i never saw a connection between tim and mary were supposed to believe that they fall in love with each other the very first day they meet that was a bit much to believe worse is that he uses the time travel to manufacture the relationship thats not love its a guy manipulating someonetim appeared like a needy guy who didnt want to do anything to screw up and end a relationship he did screw up and end the relationships on multiple occasions but with the time travel he went back and fixed it funny but the relationship came off as not genuinethe relationship between tim and his dad appeared very genuine from beginning to end that was the strength of this moviei actually thought our hero tim would be forced to sacrifice his manufactured relationship with mary with something important that would require him to time travel back before meeting mary or having his children there was a chance for this with his sisters accident or his fathers death but tim chooses to help himself instead which left me disappointed that everything was so easy this movie had potential but it took the road most traveled,happy
richard curtis once again made another film about romance and this time its got a twist time travel sure critics and moviegoers find this sweet and sentimental and one of curtis best flick but dont they get tired of all the hollywood time travel wannabees and trying to make time travel a much more easy subject now time travel films are now scattered around the globe and its irritating in this film its about a man who learns that all men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time to use this they would go inside a closet and close their eyes while clenching their fist and then voila they can now travel in time what the fu is that it its not enough science and its too brainless do they think time travel would be that easy i just hate iti think im going to agree on some people who thought that this film captures the best of romance it has its sweet and funny moments valuable lessons about love and great music too rachel mcadams is charming as always did you know that this is her third film about time travel romance she first appeared in robert schwentkes the time travelers wife and then woody allens midnight in paris and now in here didnt she get tired already but of course one thing i liked about this movie that its beautifully filmed from start to finish what more can i sayoverall about time is sweet funny and sentimental but as i said the ridiculous use of the time travel makes this film a huge disappointment i think its about time to stop this ridiculous subject unless if they really know the subject very well and had enough brains i think i will give this film a score of 5 oh and by the way there was no chemistry between domhnall gleeson and rachel mcadams,happy
we loved this movie and definitely see it as pg13 the r rating is wrong and i would encourage any family with teens to see it it is beautifully scripted with excellent acting by the entire cast the dialogue is heartfelt and original especially between father and son bill nighy and domnhall gleeson who are superb portraying the humor and unabashed love that can exist in a family when there is a core of acceptance and support for each other the time travel device  or doovers is cleverly used to show how selfconfidence and doing the right thing create desired outcomes as the story evolves the fatherson time travelers discover that doovers arent always possible and ultimately learn to fully engage in enjoying life as it comes rather than reserving their feelings for another day,happy
my wife and i saw about time at a special preview at our local theater knowing almost nothing about the film maybe thats one of the reasons it was so immensely enjoyable the film is not predictable  you never really know where its going there was something incredibly natural about the film the acting directing writing  they all felt natural missing the usual phony contrivances so typical of hollywood this may have been rachel mcadams finest performance yet  it didnt feel like she was acting and she certainly wasnt anything remotely like her role in midnight in paris the central family was relatively normal pun intended and not dysfunctional the father and mother were real treats the considerable humor was so natural  not forced guttural or contrived and the occasional tears of sadness and joy that flowed in the viewers eyes were natural as well  not forced not manipulated i deliberately didnt want to give away anything about the plot and where the film goes for the fresh path it takes is part of the joy of viewing this refreshing and very entertaining film,happy
went to a sneak preview of this on a whim knowing literally nothing about the film other than the title initially was surprised to find it was english even the theater was full and about 90 women it turned out to be on of the more enjoyable movies ive seen in ages characters you could care about plenty of light laughs and enough tension to keep it interesting we found ourselves expecting some plot points that didnt occur and the ones that did instead were well done some tears were shed and not necessarily at the moments that were clearly intended to draw that sort of emotional responsereally one of the best romantic comedies ive seen in a long time good writing enjoyable dialog solid acting from the leads on down and while the running time hits two hours youd hardly notice as the pacing is light and always keeps you engaged wondering what will happen next,happy
it was rather tedious i loved the cast but the writing was dull and rambling some of the photography will actually make you seasick there was no good reason for the shaky camera it was very oddthe fatherson relationship was very sweet the mother wasnt much of a part which confused mei was so very much looking forward to this movie and am sorely disappointed i still watch love actually faithfully i never tire of that flick i wont be buying this dvd however i may watch it again on hbo from the comfort of my own homei would recommend waiting for it to come to tv,happy
ive often talked about how when you have a film that falls on the border of decent and good it really is up to the viewer personal preferences to decide how they feel about that film ive given about time 35 stars there are some great scenes that i think couldve boosted this movie to a 4 star rating while there are other scenes that couldve dropped it down to a 3 star it is not as i have already mentioned as good as i remember it to be how many films really are ageless but i do think its still worth a watch this was my fourth time watching this film and i can honestly say i probably will watch it again a few years down the road i think the fact that i spent more time pontificating on the pros and cons of this film than i usually do should be enough to indicate that i feel something special for this film that it does mean something to me even though it does have plenty of flawsi find the sweetness and kindness instilled in some of the scenes in this movie displays a kind of tenderness that i rarely see in modern film i still get a few chuckles from some of the side characters particularly tom hollander a private war and i still love the father son relationship between tim and his dad no this isnt a perfect film but few films are my personal preferences and my own experiences with this film will lead me to like it more than some people but i think many people will still find this to be an overall enjoyable experience,happy
this film follows along the same formulaic avenues of other curtis films and seemingly has lots of characters that have been tweaked a little and dropped in here the natty slightly crazy sister for exampleand therein lies the problem the film is devoid of imagination set in a chocolate box version of london it basically follows an all too familiar path his films have taken in the past you know that at some point the characters will have to face a dark moment the trouble is that even at the darkest point its just not that dark and not that interesting and so this does impact even more on the story and alas makes the film seem really long when it should hurtle through some scenes have no value at all and you wonder why they are there you could have cut half an hour off this and it would have been a lot betterthe acting overall is excellent and the cast as you would expect top class with bill nighy the stand out for me just great to watch and of course the two leads have very good chemistry its really hard to believe this is hux from the terrible last jedi well done ruin johnsonthere were opportunities here to be riskier with the characters to take chances and create more situations of genuine jeopardy and raise the stakesalas the characters pretty much run according to type and the story carries on its all to unadventurous stroll through lifei feel the genius of four weddings apart from andie mcdowell was that it had some great little comedy moments moments you never forget coupled with the sadness of death and the characters reaction to this sadly this film never goes to those heights when it really should haveso really a missed opportunity,happy
about time may be one lighthearted love story and yes it does follow the not so original time travellin and fixing things story line so for the first part of the movie i thought ok its all about getting the girl not memorable but enjoyable  as i do like love stories but in the end this was only the begining of the second act the storyline evolves to be about a sweet perspective about the pursue of happyness bonding and acceptance so in the end this is one well acted and directed delicate piece of story telling which i recommend for all of those who appreciate the genre,happy
what a coool movie it is love u all cast n crews,happy
happened upon this movie what a pleasant surprise old fashioned nice movie everyone can enjoyrachel mcadams is totally adorable in this one of her best performanceswhat if we could fix the mistakes we have made in life a do over the possibilities are endless with this is great responsibilities and dont always go as plannedthis movie is about second chances and fixing what we could have done betterwatch this movie the best are the ones you stumble upon,happy

nothing to rave about but pretty cute romcom overall,happy
a really interesting plot and a great story good for romantics and has its share of comedic relief too very solid writing and acting im going to watch this again with my wife,happy
a beautiful story portrayed perfectly by the actors and the writers it is funny and clever you fall in love with the characters relatability from the start wonderful film,happy
i thought i was going to get a bit of a romcom with this movie so imagine my surprise when the fantasy bit that i missed in the synopsis kicked in than goodness for bill nighy and his beautiful voice without it the movie would be incomplete and the soundtrack was great otherwise i guess if you want to see rachel mcadams dont watch it cause its like shes phoning it in domnhall is pretty good because he plays average so well,happy
an incredible concept to be able to redo awkward regrettable situations i love the ways this tool was used originally to avoid embarrassing himself in front of a girl he likes to spending precious moments with his father and finally to teach tim how to enjoy every day as it comes i like how it wasnt mainly focussed on the love story but also on more serious topics loss grieving substance abuse one flaw i did pick up on was that it did feel a bit slow paced at points tim didnt seem to grow until very late on but on the whole a heartwarming story of family,happy
loved it time well spent highly recommended        a must see,happy
i love richard curtis movies and was another gem for me just a very entertaining couple of hours,happy
this is not a movie youd expect to have a lifechanging impacts though you may have nor one that makes your jaw dropthis is a movie that entertains and helps you insert a little bit more of positivity in your life so dont expect extreme conflict points or the presentation of harsh reality of lifethe main motivation of the protagonist was romance this and the fact that tim and marys relationship takes most part of the movie belittle the important key element of the relationship between tim and his dad the movie feels like it tries to emphasize the relationship between tim and mary even though this is only a portion of it all their relationship could be better too they are both interesting but the lax chemistry between the two also presentsthe time travel element is where i like the most most movies would present actions and major events in the world but in about time the time travel is simple and it is far from the tiring idea of butterfly effecti understand though that richard curtis wanted to include all kinds of relationships that tim has and show a little appreciation of time for everyone the jokes are smilekind of funny not the laughing out loud but they are very entertainingnonetheless a movie you would enjoy,happy
this movie is a smart comedy with time travel embedded in it as a plot device it cant be branded as a science fiction movie time travel isnt the main focus here its the charaters and their interpersonal relationships in the unusual context of time travel which makes the movie an enjoyable watch the charaters are carefully designed and they express themselves in a sensible noneffusive way the tongue in cheek humor adds additional flavor and the soulful theme song used could not be a better match,happy
a love story with interesting screenplay rachel mcadams is perfect for this character the music and songs are lovely i bought the soundtrack right after i watched the movie this movie will warm your heart and you will wear a smile after watching this,happy
my son came to visit and asked me if id ever seen about time is that the one with justin timberlake i said the next thing i know he was streaming it and the moment i saw it was a british film i was like ughafter a few minutes i was hooked and slowly won over by the dry humor of bill nighy and the sweet vulnerability of the irish actor whose name escapes me at the moment playing tim the premise of the movie was twofold a coming of age romance for tim and simultaneously a story of love between father and sonwithout revealing any spoilers i will say that the ending had both me and my son in tears we started talking about times with my sons grandparents and what experiences he wished could be replayed with more focus so they the grandparents would have felt the love my son had for both of them i told him they knew that without it being said then i shared some of my memories of my parents and younger brother who died when my son was two years old as the review headline states this movie is a conversation starter i highly recommend that everyone sees it,happy
this movie is the type of movie thatll stick with you for a very long time does it have flaws yes as any time traveling movie it does but there are so much more good things in this movie you wont question it its casting is 0erfect timthe father sister uncle mary everyone did their job perfectly the story is somewhat slow paced and that gives the movie the meaning even if its fantasy it really depicts how you cope with life and everything that comes with it the soundtracks were perfect not one but all of them domnhall did a great job portraying tim and a nod to rachel too for what shed done its not always that you come across a movie that hits you right in the feels it has got drama comedy tragedy and i think thats what makes it appetizing i havent been more impressed by a movie like this in my entire life and i dont think ill ever be again this is one of those movies that are so good you dont even want to go back to reality i guess thats why they call them fantasy huh,happy
 may contain spoilers  this is an amazing movie ive watched this year i really like the writing the cast and everything about this movie i love rachel mcadams on her acting  its really something wonderful to travel in time for doing good thing but also there something called destiny we cant change the events and what will happened next about time discuss this idea with a great way and a nice plot  i was really captured by this movie  he make thinks again about my life and give me a new light on how should we see the world and enjoy it with every little details  thank you about time thank you richard curtis for this lovely movie 3 i recommend this movie  910 ,happy
about time is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast it is a very sweet and heartwarming film as we follow a young man who learns he has the power to time travel and uses it to win a girl over however as the film continues he uses his power less and less as he begins to savor the moments and not trying to reverse them it easily could have been a typical love story but it has plenty of elements that make it stand out the only real issue i had was bill nighy i thought he was fantastic as the father and found him to be very underused his character is underdeveloped we learn very little about him i would love to have gained more insight on him as i thought the scenes between him and gleesons character are the films highlights domhnall gleeson is stellar in this movie believable and likable all the way through as well as a character that i feel anyone can relate to his chemistry with rachel mcadams is phenomenal it is a privilege to watch them on screen together delivering pure honest emotion the film leaves you feeling happy for the life you have lived and excited for what awaits as we must make the best of the time we have sweet and well acted i would recommend about time to anyone looking for a good drama or romantic film a mans life gets complicated when he uses his ability to time travel to seek romantic bliss best performance domhnall gleeson,happy
this is an incredible movie for i believe its a romantic comedy with a deep poignant message that is purposely intended primarily for men ive watched this movie two times now and both times it has made me cry both times its made me focus on whats most valuable in lifethe point i feel the writer and director wanted to make here is about our precious relationships particularly between father and son and the importance and temporal nature of time time like our lives is a vapor that will quickly disappear enjoy each day like its our last make life enjoyable for others in your life great humor sublime subtle acting particularly from bill nighy and domhnall gleeson carefully watch the subtle nuances in their faces throughout every scene richard curtis is one of the finest british writers and directors of the modern era always managing to capture and fuse love emotion and humor i am super critical of movies and im very hard to please where films are concerned but this movie is one of the best i have ever seen and moved me in a way i have never been moved before with a movie great acting extremely well written funny poignant and an excellent cast its extraordinary the way this movie was written to elicit such emotion from the viewer especially men be prepared to change the way you view your relationship with your father and the precious transient nature of time,happy
youre either a fan of richard curtis or youre not theres not much space in between long time admirers have readily come to terms with the fact that his stories will never venture outside that safe spotless and sanitised version of england which is often coupled with the aggressively quaint middle class of hugh grant yet his films are not always as modest as they are on the surface particularly when they claim to represent the entire countrys longing near christmas time now that i think about it its often the effortless windswept debonair of grant that prevents these films from being too scrutinised would we question that chiselled jaw the same way we question the gangly awkward ginger of gleeson tim finds an early and sweet connection with mary on a blind literally double date at a restaurant and feels as if he is entitled to that same connection after his time travelling erases it perhaps he is but is it then morally right to pretend to be someone he is not to act vastly more interested in her interests than he really is to redo their first time in bed until they are lights out to mouth off at the potential boyfriend that he beats to the chase a meanspirited out of character comment mary herself doesnt seem to have a lot of say in this relationship and when he pushes tim for a third child it feels less like an actual desire of her character and more the screenplay tapping tim on the shoulder and telling him that his time is up in lindsay duncans interrogations her imperfections are cutesy labels that dont appear anywhere else while hes erased all of his it feels dishonest in response to these dilemmas curtis might respond by showing the first example of tims experimentation with time travel a simple and elegant demonstration of the powers limitations after a summer of attempting to woo charlotte that reasoning suggests that no matter how many different approaches tim fashions she is bound to gently reject him and so vice versa the same must apply to mary the initial spark is there so their romance is merely a matter of time this notion might have more weight to it if curtis wasnt playing fast and loose with the logic of his brand of time travel the power is lightly sprung onto a young tim from his father with the nonchalance of buying a teenager a new car and he only pops up periodically to shed new light on rules and regulations the story is sweeter and more honest when the characters are the ones making the choices themselves her slipping a little white lie into their conversation and getting him to walk her all the way home and after the most casually adorable proposal ever he doesnt rush to the nearest cupboard but merely shushes the planned band away their weddings weather must be a black omen from the heavens themselves but she wouldnt even dare consider the idea of a redo curtis flair behind the camera shines best when he injects splashes of formal elements into the honeymoon period of two young lovers  how mary first emerges from the restaurant curtains with a little halo over her head how the camera shakes with giddiness during tims walk home in the way the world seems to come alive at their feet and in how subway buskers seem to be personally serenading their blossoming romance when hes not leaning on voiceover the soundtrack does an adequate job churning whenever tims anxiety beckons him to the cupboard and softly accompanying the pair on piano in the gentler moments he also utilises the montage to great comedic effect one prominent example cycling through the various disasters of best man speeches and cutting abruptly to signal tims exasperation but for all the rainsoaked sentimentality about time moves towards a rather different end goal than the posters and curtis film history might suggest the awkward tim has solved the problem of his fanciful love life but what happens when he tries to wield his powers to save others in his family kit kat who bounds in and out of scenes like an overexcited puppy crashes and burns because she does not have the power or so tim thinks contrivances that force him to let things play out aside he learns that sometimes fate is better off left alone and that sometimes you need to let those you love learn their own lessons gleeson sells the role we all envision ourselves in by trying desperately to reach out and shield everyone and in doing so discovering the cursed side of his blessing its a long way just to say carpe diem but the message is well intentioned near the end there are a series of shots of a sleepy mary nestling her head back into her pillow and they are cut in a way that suggests tim is replaying the day over and over when in fact it is merely his mind magnifying and basking in the moment he hasnt lost his power of time travel but hes gained a new one in the appreciation of mortality and the preciousness of life,happy
a movie about timetravel with a slight twist about time is a british romantic comedy drama directed by richard curtis and starring domnhall gleeson rachel mcadams and bill nighydomnhall gleeson plays the role of a young mantim lake from a seemingly normal family of his parents sister and his absentminded uncle that is until his father tells him about the unique ability the men in his family have tim has the ability to go to any moment in his life which he has lived by thinking a little hard about it while his father has used his timetravelling ability to read books he advises tim to use this ability to improve his life but there was only one thing which tim would use the ability for to get himself a girlfriendbehind the amusing story of tim trying to find love in his life lie some really great messages on how to make the most of your life richard curtis has beautifully and subtly portrayed them tim has the ultimate gift which almost everyone wishes to have to be able change past mistakes to be able to do things which we missed out or held ourselves from tim can live any past day again for the umpteenth time but his journey through the film teaches him to live everyday just once but as if it is the second time and appreciate the small but important things in life at one point in the film he tries to better his sisters life by changing her past decisions but when he realizes the repercussions of this method he has to undo the changes and finally helps his sister clean up her act in the present his journey also teaches him to let go of things in this case his father and accept life as it comesthe only problem with the movie which i found was a small issue with his powers tim discovers that if he jumps to time before his children are born he might lose them or get other ones due to various factors but this was essential to actually impart the messages which underlie the filmthe performances by domnhall gleeson and bill nighytims father are spectacular and invoke a feeling of deep connection with the character rachel mcadams plays the role of tims unknowing wife portraying a strong character who supports the unsure tim in his problems with lifethe movie touches upon some sensitive issues like the lack of time we face and how we miss out on the small but important things in life and gives an important less ie to appreciate the life which you have and to live it with no regrets,happy
men of a family have a special ability which is time travel they can only go back the past a man of the special family knows the ability and he enjoys his life to the full the genre of this movie is though sf at first because some of this movies characters can do time travel but the main theme is love the love is not only a pair of lovers but also family when we were children we knew only love of family but we know a many kinds of love in proportion as we grow up especially it is love of a boyfriend or girlfriend in addition we know we love someone and own family was the most important when we were children but it is changed a lovable person a boyfriend or girlfriend is the most important if we have baby maybe it becomes the most important this movie describes these things wonderfully passing time is crucial and time isnt forever therefore our life is beautiful and we must live life to the full,happy
after another disappointing new years party a young man learns to travel time from his father thus the most important plot device of the movie is introducedevery scene is outstanding well acted and put together cant say a bad word about it in fact whole movie is excels in that department unfortunately storyline is not as good as acting and directing sloppy time travel rules lead to countless plot holes and overuse of the power it simply becomes ultimate answer for every problem of the life i wonder if he travels time whenever he overcooks food or stains a toilet seat i really waited for the second act i wanted to see main character facing real problem and grow as a person but i was disappointed every problem and conflict can be easily resolved and character development is mostly observed through narrationbut the most annoying part of the movie are forced morals lesson of the movie is to live every day as it was final make a decision and live with it it sounds extremely ironic coming from a time traveler who cheated most of his adulthood problems and decisionsfor me movie was quite conflicting but over all impression is good i like fatherson relationship i laughed at awkward moments and i loved some of romantic moments its a good movie and worth watching but definitely not a 1010 my vote is 75 rounded to 7 just to compensate for 1010 reviews if you think this is the best romantic movie with fantasyscifi elements watch grounhog day or eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,happy
one thing you have to do if you decide watching this do not care about inconsistencies or trying to make sense of it there is more wrong with the internal logic that you will be able to stomach if you go down that road of course the actors are able to distract you most of the time really nice work done there but there will be times where youre just going to go really again try to suppress that urge and dive into the sweetness of this movie and the fun you can have with it too its a romantic comedy with a twist if you want to call it that but time travel issues have brought down other movies too it never can be completely on the level so cherish the notion of the fun and hop along for the ride,happy
im a guy who really loves love actually as such i had high expectations for this film this is a good film but im not sure it quite crosses the threshold for greatnesslove actually did a great job of showing different kinds of loveplatonic familial romantic about time also does this well with a particular focus on family bonds tims relationship with his dad is the most welldeveloped in the movie and its fantastic to watch i was even close to tears a few timesmy one issue though is that mary the love of tims life is underdeveloped as a character the movie spends a lot of time telling us how much he loves her and doesnt really spend much time telling us why he loves hershes pretty much just a stock cutesy rachel mcadams character without any expressed goals ambitions or quirks we dont have this problem with the other characterstheir development is fairly proportional to their importance to tim and so one of the major plot lines falls a bit flatultimately though this was still worth seeing the fatherson story makes the movie by itself and theres more to the story than just those to i just wish it had balanced those bits with the romantic element better,happy
a universal film richard curtis is on familiar territory in this timetravelling romcoman englishman discovers that he can travel in time and uses this to try to get a girlthose who like the romcom or timetravel genres will love this film director and writer richard curtis has crafted this timetravelling romcom it is a natural companion to four weddings and a funeral 1994 and notting hill 1999 however whilst both those films were rated 15 another time is rated 12a in the uk though there should be no criticism of the film it is not tame it is not a kids film but rather an adult film for adults that deals with adult themes richard curtis was the writer in all three films but in at he directs too unlike the previous two films camera work is a little wobbly in earlier shots and some music is a little intrusive having said that the two scenes that really featured music were both beautifully conceived and filmedplot is basic but to repeat young man uses time travel to try to get a girl some mistakes can be rectified and futures changed through the use of time travel thus this film is comparable to groundhog day 1993 in both films the hero uses timetravel rather selfishly at first before maturing and using timetravel in a more constructive way however whilst gd just repeated one day in at timetravel is over a longer period of timecuriously andie macdowall costarred in gd it will be remembered that miss macdowall was also in the fwaaf curtisvehicle in his two previous films fwaaf and nh mr curtis had an englishgentleman and an american woman meeting in an upperclass environment this film is again partially set in london as well as out in the country again the socialset is very upper class lots of girls with awfully posh voices and there is even an americanwhile the characters are interesting and even stereotypical silly things clearly have more going on in their lives than is first thought the socialset being portrayed is very thin indeed there has been criticism of richard curtis in the past for showing a very limited slice of humanity in previous films the same applies today with this his newest film in a recent interview mr curtis said he tried to do an urbanboston film and realized he couldnt do it so he went back to what he knewthis is a very good film about the lives of white upperclass liberals and certainly they will tend to mix with their own kind and set however it is not acceptable today to portray london as a city solely populated by rich whites there was criticism of the 1999 film notting hill for showing notting hill as being entirely populated with whites for the record notting hill has been a very diverse multicultural and multiracial area for decades as has been much of london the notting hill carnival is a vast celebration of caribbean people and their culture london also has many many workingclass people too sadly none of these groups feature in richard curtis films at all except perhaps as menial serversyou would have thought that fourteen years after notting hill that mr curtis would have given some thought to writing parts for people of colour and workingclass people sadly not sadly mr curtis has learnt nothing in all these years he is truly colourblind he sees noone else in his rich white world this reviewer thought criticism of richard curtiss earlier films for being too rich and white was a bit harsh sadly i now feel that criticism has not been harsh enough it is a serious flaw of this film the writing of it the casting of it that once again it inhabits an unreal rich white world that only exists in the head of richard curtishaving said all that however this is a great film like his previous films again here mr curtis gives us once again a beautiful romcom the timetravel thing is really just a plot device the core of this film is about relationships all sorts of relationships but boymeetsgirl stuff is of course the central core of this film from start to end we see a bevy of beautiful babes so too does our hero he can timetravel to change the past change the way he interacts with a girl for this reviewer the first time was the best and sweetest just perfect however as time goes by life gets more complicated and so does the time travel as the film progresses our hero faces decisions with great consequences ordinary mistakes and timetravel mistakes could have devastating consequences viewers will watch tensely as decisions are made as our timetravel hero tries to learn how to live every day so too may we the timetravel theme is not the most important theme so do not worry about it accept dont question just enjoy a film whos central theme is lovea great supporting cast fill the characters in this film with real life rachel mcadams is a real stand out as one of the girls who the timetraveller meets domhnall gleeson is the timetraveller and he too totally convinces as he matures through this filmif you liked four weddings and notting hill as well as groundhog and even enjoyed the romantic elements in timecop 1994 then this is the film for you highly recommended 910,happy
i hated 4 weddingsthought love actually was a disappointment  that the love boat was richard curtiss nadirhowever i was pleasantly surprised by about time  the story was intriguingthe acting was exemplary  the actors were perfectly castbill nighy does the best bill nighy ever once you accept the basic premiseie time travellingwhich is not really made a big deal ofyou become involved in the possible outcomes of tims attempts to alter events  there are lots of unexpected results due to his tinkering with time not panning out as expected i think that its richard curtiss best film but due to familiarity with his style may not be so recognised as a lot of it is on familiar ground with the settings  the characters lifestyle,happy
id probably have to give this 6 out of 10 i downgraded it from a 7 after further consideration girls will probably like this somewhat more than men but its not entirely a chick flick i really enjoyed love actually and i love rachel mcadams what guy wouldnt so coupled with the generally very good reviews i expected to really like thisthe movie is certainly worth seeing and im sure some will like it more than others but overall i just felt like it definitely didnt reach its potential due in large part to a very poor soundtrack and musical score im 43 and i like a very broad range of music but i can only think of one song in the entire movie that i was even familiar friday im in love by the cure because it played early in the movie and its a great song and also because love actually had a great soundtrack i was expecting a lot more everybody knows a good score andor a good soundtrack can make or break a movie and for me at least this was just one of those movies where it largely broke itim guessing i wasnt alone in being somewhat disappointed by the movie since we were literally the only two people in the theater for a 1020pm showing in a medium sized southern california town thats a little bit late but certainly not so late that the theater shouldve been 100 empty i think id have to recommend this one for a redbox rental when it comes out in 6 months rather than overpaying to see it at the theater,happy
the movie was ok just ok i feel like ive seen films similar before the main character finds out he has time traveling powers and of course he uses it to go back in time for things such as finding a girlfriend this theme is used in pretty much any movie where a character has the opportunity to go back and relive his life and of course againthere is a major death which i predicted would happen as soon as i found out that the main character could go back in time better yet i also was able to take a guess which character would die this film did has some good jokes and playonwords and i liked the acting when this film comes to theaters around holiday time im not sure if the crowds will be rushing to see it,happy
honestly hated it but that singular scene where tim goes back to see his father lost my mind crying absolutely heartbreaking,happy
if you like movies evolve around time travel and events coherence then i can say that it might not represent what you expect it is purely a cute romantic movie that includes some time travel as an extra element i am a science fictiontimetravel and event coherence genre fan and i would like to say that i really liked this movie a lot the acting cast were amazing and handling of scenes was perfect as there are no wasted moments and when i feel that there are extra scenes that serve no purpose to understand this movie i get melted with these moments that build up the emotional connectionone of the best romantic timetravel involved movies not an ordinary romantic movie as it gives a clear message of what are life choices that impact the rest of our lives it is about our lifes time,happy
i was enjoying the first 45 minutes of the film however it then got to a stand still where nothing was happening and then before i knew it the film was over i expected the film to be much more deep and emotional the whole concept of going back in time seemed fun however detail was missed out on how or why they even have that ability they could of done so much more to the film i love rachel mcadams however this is probably the worst film ive seen her in although hes not my cup of tea i think domhnall gleeson was perhaps a good actor for the role he played a very cute quirky funny character of tim the film wasnt absolute rubbish however it isnt amazing just okay it doesnt match up to the time travellers wife,happy
tim lake lives a pleasant life in cornwall with his family but he is shy with girls and unlucky in love when he turns twenty one his father discloses a family secret to him telling that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time first a little dumbfounded tim finds that his father is telling the truth and when he moves to london to work as a lawyer he falls in love with mary and seduces her fixing his mistakes in the relationship during his life tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors but also in the lives of his relatives and friendsits a really strange one this its funny well acted and the relationship between tim and his dad is magical truly beautiful but it doesnt have the spirit of curtis other moviesfirstly his films like love actually and notting hill had characters you could relate to normal people who would probably bump into you on the way to the tube and this is the fundamental flaw with the film the main family are just a bunch of snobs and bar nighy who is the best thing about the film they are not a very likable bunchthe time travel gimmick is good very well done but when you look into the aspects of this a little deeper you find it to be very macabre indeed in one scene tim almost literally appearing to one character as the grim reaper as they know why he is acting differentlythe rest if the cast are good mcadams is great but miscast hollander is so good hes hateful and it still has that curtis vibe to it just not so muchim sure if time travel were possible it would be the best movie ever because curtis would have made it twenty years ago and had hugh grant as the leadwould make a great double bill with xmen days of future past,happy
this is not a bad film just not a great film the sqiss summed it up in their review perfectly theres some good stuff in it but it was bloated and even for richard curtis too saccharine its very close to the time travellers wife in a lot of respects obviously the huge difference being its a comedy rather than a romance speaking of which there was very little chemistry between the two leads but there was a great hook between dad and son as the squiss pointed out in hisher review i think the girls will probably like this more than the boys but its not a complete waste of time just a wasted opportunity as i think it could have been better,happy
there are many good lines in here the main character instead of delivering them in his own way does an imitation of hugh grant but sad to say lacks something they are good just not as interesting and why not  this script was written by the same person who wrote notting hill richard curtis the acting is good the script should have been rewritten a few more times he wanted us to learn about life to live everyday carefree and instead it becomes somewhat pointless and at the end instead of crying i wanted it to end on the other hand it is not upsetting has good scenes and is a good movie to put on before you go to sleep,happy
when i started watching the movie i expected so much more the beginning was great and then it all got lost as if richard curtis could not decide what the story should be about should it be about time travelling should it be about relationship between son and father should it be about the family about love or about who knows what like scattered pieces of puzzle those questions pop up now and then throughout the movie refusing to fall into places to form a wholesome picture the main protagonist tim has some potential but then he lacks purpose or direction in his actions he also does not know what to do with his life or his gift of being able to travel back in time he does appear as nice and caring though so bloody dull and boneless supporting characters seem to be on their own supporting no one in particular the main heroine is nothing but pretty face who supposedly reads other peoples novels she lacks any interesting traits or lines to say she is almost like a piece of furniture in the movie and you cannot help but wonder what tim has found in her perhaps their dullness unites them there are no great wisdoms or even small ones either two hours of time claimed but utter banal trivial storyless directionless movie,happy
about time 2013 dir richard curtis  cast domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams bill nighy lydia wilson margot robbie boring romantic comedy with a title that addresses the meeting between the title characters but it also addresses the need for family it stars domhnall gleeson as tim a young lawyer who moves to london but before he does his father tells him of a ridiculous time travel secret that males in the family know it sounds about as dumb as it actually is this involves going into a dark place clenching his fist appearing where he desires to go this is stupid beyond words and one would hope that the screenwriter would go to a dark place and return to the drawing board when initiating this crap director richard curtis had success with love actually but here he seems as if grasping for anything that ignites a subplot gleeson and rachel mcadams survive the material with charm as they have children and gleeson struggles to use the time travel around them other roles arise during crucial moments and then dropped as if an after thought bill nighy plays tims father whose one ambition seems to be playing ping pong with his son lydia wilson plays kit kat who seems to be named after a chocolate bar and we are never given a break her strong point is a car accident before this becomes unimportant margot robbie plays a beautiful fixation of the gleeson character where communication is problematic it has a theme regarding family and the fact that living each day beats the things we cannot change overall it is about time we watch a superior comedy on the subject groundhog day score 4  10,happy
reading the imdb synopsis on the movie i was intrigued by the concept thinking it might be more scifi about time travel but it turned out this was a minimal ingredient for what turns out to be a human interest story and more so a mushy love storynot that this is bad necessarily but i was hoping to see some cool sci time travel conceptsover all the main actor seems to pull it off pretty well and there is a bevy of cute girls with nice jobs as wellif you are male just keep in mind this in more of a movie that you will want to watch with your girlfriend to get in a chickflick quota,happy
one friend of mine describes curtis as the marmite man  you either love him or hate him another friend can rant about the failings of love actually for so long that i start to replay shallow grave in my head and recast him as the poor lodgerthis is love actually mark 2 the familiar curtis characters gentle english wit and the aint life grand message are all present and correct the only thing missing is hugh grant but domhall does a lovely impersonationeverything was set up perfectly for a great story one which shows that even with the chance to redo any moment life goes its own way unfortunately richard never took the opportunity to tell us a story instead he delivers one mans life collated in delightful kodak moments  the kind of life i am sure many a man would have like to have certainly most of their girlfriends would like to believe so we have idyllic childhood bohemian family endearing romance with barely a hiccup to mar his perfect existence as the years slide by richard curtis has said this is his last film and perhaps it is best it is if he cannot bring himself to write even one day of rain and screaming children into his characters life does he really have anything to say that a john lewis ad cant do in a fraction of the time enjoy on a rainy day take someone you can curl up with while the rose coloured glasses are still on and see the life youd like to imagine you might have unfold just dont go for a riveting story,happy
soppywetrubbish the last 20 mins is people crying at a funeral awful,happy
see this is why i shouldnt just play a movie on netflix without researching it a bit had i done my homework i wouldve known that about time was made by the same nitwit behind love actually 2003 a movie which is awful actually perhaps i couldve foreseen that no this will not be a clever narrative about time travel it will ruin the fun of it actually and all for the sake of sophomoric sentimentality movie romcom love is a powerful force i will grant youit can crush all love and intelligence from just about anything and richard curtis seems to be out to prove thatit should go without saying that the time travel here is nonsensical and breaks nearly every rule it establishes in the first place and invents new ones along the way for plot convenience or that its entirely selfcentered for the happiness of the creepy hero no superhero antics for this supernatural egoist hes content to manipulate the unsuspecting lives of those around him for his own benefit even the mixing of time travel with a silly movie romance isnt original in fact rachel mcadams had already starred in another one the time travelers wife 2009 but then nothing here is original this is the same cookiecutter trifle full of clichs and stock characters offered to moviegoers over and over againoh and how condescending to have these moneyed filmmakers with their budgets and revenues of millions of dollars preach to us about money being a mixed bag as the father character claims sure better to drown our minds in loveydovey sap at the price of a ticket by watching millionaires tell us whats important in life lets trade each other our mixed bags of money then tell me whats important in life actually,happy
i have very mixed emotions about this movie it is amazing acting beautifully shot and initially a very exciting storyline then halfway through new and exciting things just stop happening its like the storyteller quit and they just decided to keep on going with the last written page everything is suddenly good in the hood everything goes according to plan and i dont even know why i should continue to watch i dont know i just expected more purpose,happy
i remembered vaguely not liking this film but when i somehow found myself watching it again recently i couldnt remember why i actually found the first 35 minutes or so mildly entertaining so i though it was maybe worth giving it another go i was wrong as it goes on it just gets more and more annoying it is just horribly sentimentalized and it is way too long seriously someone should have taken a pair of scissors to that last 30 minutesit is totally unnecessary and really cringe i have given it two stars because it not the worst film i have ever seen but ill definitely be giving this one a miss next time,happy
first of all id like to say that i really like romantic dramas and the topics this movie covers but i still have a few reasons why this movie didnt really do it for me i wouldnt say it was bad but it definitely was too long it should have been half an hour long and it wouldnt have felt this drawling i didnt feel anything special about the acting it felt me wanting a little more drama i also didnt really get the message it was in my opinion really subtly delivered and maybe a bit weak i felt something missing after watching it like it was incomplete and unfinished in my eyes its a cute little story but nothing more maybe worth to once watch but it definitely wont be my favorite,happy
i saw about time starring domhnall gleesonharry potter and the deathly hallowspart 2 true grit2010 rachel mcadamsthe vow wedding crashers bill nighyjack the giant slayer harry potter and the deathly hallowspart 1 and lindsay duncanunder the tuscan sun star warsepisode 1the phantom menace this is a weird time travellove story im not exactly sure who the target audience is domhnall plays a young english lad that finds outon his 21st birthdaythat he can travel into the past and change events there are a few rulesof course even in a time travellove story you have to have rules for instance he can only travel to destinations during his own lifetimehe could not go back and kill hitler because that was before he was bornand he can not tell anyone about this abilityexcept for his own son on his 21st birthday bill plays his father that gives him this startling news and lindsay plays his clueless mother rachel plays the american girl that domhnall uses his new powers to ensnare as a girlfriend and then later as his wife there is also a side story about the relationship between domhnall and bill it was rated r for language and sexual contenti remember partial nudity only nothing full frontaland has a running time of 2 hours  3 minutes its not one that i would buy on dvdit was a pretty typical love story with the only new twist being the time travel abilitybut it would be alright as a rental my wife did say that she thought it was a little too long,happy
i had great expectations for this film and went to its first showing 1025am on opening day to my surprise many people were at the showingoverall i was disappointed but found domhnall gleesons skill and charm in the leading role the most enjoyable element of this film but the movie itself felt more like a series of skits maybe the skitlike feel supported the central theme of this movie as with most timetravel movies namely live for today relish every moment maybe i just feel like the genre is really wornout with not much fresh to offer i did leave the theater with that tell my wife and children how much i love them everyday every moment sort of feeling but only because im extremely sentimental anyway and need very little to elicit that emotionthe movie was cast pretty well but i think rachel mcadams at 35 is at the end of her castasatwentysomething girl even bangsfringe couldnt make me believe it the film was worth seeing but save your money and see it on dvd no rush to see it right away or need to see it on the big screen,happy
ive always considered richard curtis to be vastly overrated a pedestrian talent garlanded with best of breed gongs by the easily satisfied this is not to say that i havent enjoyed isolated moments from four weddings notting hill love actually  i had no interest in watching the drivel about pirate radio stations as my interests in that area lie in real music on the other hand the cynic in curtis has lucked in to the fact that most of us have lost either someone relative close friend or a golden time childhood first love that we would given the chance love to revisit albeit briefly in order to experience profound happiness once again this is of course a time honoured sorry about that device that has informed such properties as its a wonderful life carousel here comes mr jordan etc i am no different to most people in this respect in that i too have lost someone would dearly love to go back even for just a fleeting moment and am therefore susceptible to films like this and recognizing this in myself am prepared to overlook the flaws noted here by other viewers,happy
i was soooo bored nothing interesting really happens the best part is the first talk he has with his dad when he finds out the secret after that its just mind numbing 2 hours of boredom pity,happy
this movie has inspired me to believe that i too can write scripts this movie also made me want to travel back in time to prevent the writer from making this film,happy
i was completely baited by the high imdb rating and the recommendation of a list of movies thatre similar to the groundhog day that list listed reasonable entries like source code good ones like edge of tomorrow happy death day and excellent one like triangle really creepy too and the list put this movie at 1 sad despite noticing some absurdity of the list it also listed movies like her predestination before i fall  theyre either not really dailyrepeating or just bad i still had high expectations of about time after seeing its 78 imdb ratingabout time has comedy potential it has a completely absurd and illogical time traveling premise that i was expecting the time travel to bring a lot of laugh but sadly theres nothing funny in the plot while there were clearly paltry attempts at being funny they fell way way short the movie quickly turned into a completely boring romcom without comedy the leading characters are not really that likeable and its hard to care about their romance the plot itself isnt even coherent its like someone just tried to turn a sitcom episode into a feature length movie it was a disasterso seriously take my advice avoid this movie at all cost,happy
ah time travel a great classic of cinema often tackled in sciencefiction but here it is from the romantic comedy angle that richard curtis deals with overused premisehis writing is relatively sharp the situations often ring true and with this sweet and sour tone peppered with a touch of humour all the conditions were there for an effective rom com but what curtis is telling us is that tim manages to be happy only because of his gift which is very pessimistic but most importantly in total contradiction with the optimistic epilogue completely hypocrite because though tim concludes by the fact that he is happy and doesnt want to travel back in time anymore he has used this gift for all the movie to shape a suitable present the script is therefore not coherent at all and you will forget this about time extremely flat and a lot too long by the way as soon as it is finished,happy
this is one of those films i do not know how to grade what to say about it since i have my ten lines to fill i will have to say somethingfirst of all most uk films i saw in my life were extraordinary this one is not i think it is an average try to make it humorous and entertaining i think they failed after first hour i wanted to switch it off time travel makes it interesting but not amusing where is that british sense of humor gone boring acting is good on the side of excellent actors are really trying to do their best scenes of english folk are also interesting but not astonishing hell emily hartridge with her 10 reasons why on facebook is more fun for 10 minutes then this film is anywhere close for long two hoursuse your time better walk in the countryside during that rain which is present all the time in england,happy
29 of 10 clich melodrama at its worst it looks like comcasts executives are taking over film selection at universal clearly a film built to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the simplest possible ways to make some easy cashhad the film been cut off at about the 90 minute mark it would have been tolerable the opening and first 60 minutes are interesting and amusing enough to make up for the general stupidity of the storywhile time travel films tend to be the worst dribble of science fiction as it is this does at least reduce it to pure fantasy a gift but that combined with a run of the mill romantic comedy that appears to be richard curtiss attempt to get kate moss to sex him up and have his children before he dies doesnt add up to a good use of time,happy
i cant help it but the main character was just really boring and annoying he has this superpower but only uses it to manipulate peopleand i really hate myself for saying this because its so superficial but the main character is just sooo extremely unattractive and quite thick to be honest and with this superpower and a real blindblind date he manipulates himself into a relationship with this gorgeous girl get out of here,happy
this movie is slow nothing exciting at all happens the main character has no personality what so ever he is so annoying can i travel back in time and chose a different movie,happy
im a lover of romance movies and chick flicks so i thought id spend a couple of very entertaining hours while watching this turns out i was utterly bored while the first 2030 were interesting and humorous it went downhill from there turning more and more serious but without depth or a story to tell imho the heros ability to timetravel was underused after the opening act and didnt add anything to an otherwise unremarkable plot the fact that some people compare it with and even find it better than love actually is nothing sort of astounding and has me questioning if we all watched the same film,happy
20 years before this film was done there was groundhog day that film had an almost religious following it only had one person everything happening to and there was only one day which was lived over and over again until that perfect day which i believe was the reason for the religious followingthis film blunders through a similiar topic 20 years later and the only thing thats been added is a stload of stupidity,happy
the beginning of this movie was absolutely charming i found myself wondering how the time travel elements would play out and had high hopesalas his antics trying to fix things were neither comical or interesting or made any sensedad tells junior you can only go back and relive things youve already experienced so protagonist heads to a party he never attended within first 30 minutesbut little plot holes are forgivable if everything else is well written and executed this wasnt i just checked my timestamp 44 minutes in out of 123 heck noi just dont care enough about anyone to continue i assume based on some other reviews here a lot hinges on manic pixie dream girl sister sorry other than i found his dialogue about her being the most perfect girl in the world a little weird her presence is scant for first third of the movie oh brother,happy
atrocious movie literally ive never seen a movie with such a high regard and such a big budget being so consistently insulting to the intelligence of the audienceall the characters are annoyingly happy all the time except the guy who hates children because you know cynicalhates children right everybody knows that they are either archetypes or bland as hell the movie hammers constantly the theme of love love love will conquer the world to the point it feels like satire or a saturday morning cartoon what love the guys have no chemistry like at all are you kidding me they get laid once and they are in love apparently it also seems soo immature the guy like trying to show off with the time travel its not funny it serves no purpose and its soooo cringycartoonish as well is the script blatantly artificial and inconsistently paced i mean first the movie follows the events with a fairly reasonable timing then suddenly jumpes off years and years into the future hence what you achieve is murdering the tension and by the way there is not a single main tension in the movie you got subplots where there is some tension its quickly solved and suddenly the movie moves on into another time lapse infuriating i was about to kill myself with this garbage no really i mean it with every choice they make i was feeling sicker and sicker wandering how retarded this director and writers weremargot robbie is in this movie and still im wondering why because its character was completely worthlessoh and how could i forget there is time travel in this movie but i must warn you it will make even less sense than the usual time travel you see in other movies and what a surprise it serves no purpose 85 of the movie you could erase it from the movie until the ending and the idiotic plot wouldnt be affected furthermore the reasons the guy travels in time are until the third act so idiotic and absurd that i almost thought it was a joke but no this stinker of a movie thinks that has heart that shows how love works no it doesnt and believes in these fairy tales not even disney would buy if there were some jokes i could let it pass but nothing this crap is meant to be taken seriouslyany positives well i guess the dresses are pretty when we are in the wedding the cinematography is not terrible eitherbut the cherry on top is the ending i guess its the part that the people praise honestly we all know why because its a tearjerker i know it you know it nothing else,happy
i cant say i enjoyed the film watching the same pattern throughout of doingsaying something wrong then going back in time to change what happenedwhat was said it felt like watching groundhog day 2 stars fyii dont enjoy watching the same scene of a film over and over again unless i press the rewind buttonthe idea of if you go back before your childs birth it affects the child seems weird i dont understand how changing something in your own life can affect an unborn child especially to the extend of changing the childs gender and hair colour as with posyfrom the start everything about it made me thing of the same film about a boy the posh english accent gleeson put on coupled with the constant voiceover made me think hugh grantif i had closed my eyes id swear it was grantand all i can saying about bill nighy was that he was just bill night i havent seen him in much but hes the same in everythingnot a great film and not one id recommend,happy
in my opinion tim doesnt support mary one prime example of this is when mary approaches him about having a third child he isnt open to the idea and reacts the wrong way even though he isnt open to the idea he shouldve gave a more detailed explanation as to why this furthermore makes the relationship shared between the married couple unhealthy as it lacks support and communication,happy
the message in this film is that life is finite but beautiful if you only open up your senses and breathe it inalthough the time travel concept is initially interesting and funny it then tries to deliver a deep and meaningful message but descends into a soppy you can live happy ever after despite tragedy message though clever the film fails to deliver enough laughs and the chemistry between the two main characters isnt to sell the film,happy

tim is an ordinary boy which had trouble all his life with girls due to his timid character and his not so appealing appearance at the age of 21 his father reveals him a big family secret that he can travel back in time using a simple trick thats exactly what tims life needed in order to become perfect he sets out to find his true love not hesitating to use his new power as many times as he though necessary we follow his adventures from there on which turn out to be more interesting than i had hoped at least in the first half of the movieit is funny emotional and somewhat captivating but thats exactly what i cannot say about the second part it becomes boring over prolonged unnecessary actually describing a series of events which i dont quite know what they are looking for in the movie they complicated the plot without any reason making it dull and boring i really enjoyed this films idea and the way it made use of it but that is not a reason to add sequences in it just to make it longer i liked how the main actors played their part especially with that english accent which i find appropriate for this movie overall it is an enjoyable movie spoiled a bit by its second part which should have been shorter,happy
so i watched this when it first aired and i loved it i was besotted with the notebook girl with her red lipstick i am male by the way i also appreciate bill neihey sic in a love actually sort of way and this film worked well on release its a new notting hill jeez even the awkward ginger kid sounds like hugh grant but now in 2017 and seeing it a second time have i simply been lost in time have i got old and grumpy or has the 4 years dated the flickcall me shallow but margot robbie as awful as she is as predicted would have stolen me at the walk me to my room moment i am not one to stray but for her i would regardless this and the massive plot holes led me to switch off and do something less boring instead enough said 0,happy
i dont think this review is going to help a lot of people understanding or appreciating the movie because i dont like this movie but it has stayed in my mind and bothered me for quite a while its time to finally write and forget about itif i had to sum up this movie id use honest trailers line for the notebook the movie your girlfriend will make you watchunlike notebook however this movie makes me wonder  how can you make a movie with no conflict  how can you be the most boring prick around with an awesome superpower  how can you renounce your superpowers when you could change anything in the world  how can you stick to one girlfriend  one lifestyle  one job  the same circle of friends  with unlimited opportunities  how can you present a story of love and confidence when the main hero does not share about his alternate lifei could not format this sorryi think this movie appalled me through and trough and over and over again because there are so many people with so many superpowers money power science  and everybody seems to mind their own business not even traveling or looking around in the world just like the main character in this movie its a sad thing if a guy like this existed he wouldnt give a sht about more than 10 people in his life its terrible,happy
about time a movie kinda similar to premature and project almanac well in premature movie where guy got back in time when he had orgasm but in this movie no need to get orgasm he can just go back in time to go a dark place and close his eye and use some force and thats it he is back in time living same day not he is only his whole family man can do that even his father who told about this to him but this movie is all about love romance so he dont have a gf so he just using his power to get a girl after when he meet one and lost him and again got it some time he is being a dickhead he just made a short mistake and he just go back in time to escape from that mistake its like you have power so you are using it useless but whatever overall about love and romance thing its fine for me i am kinda scifi lover guy so i just liked project almanac type movie but probably it will best for you look at rating imdb 78 i liked premature more than this that have a lots of comedy and its kinda unrated comedy movie too,happy
tim is your usual twenty somethings bad with women awkward and miserable in life when tim reaches the age of 21 his dad told him that the men in his family can travel back in time in any desired time during his life on earth with this new ability will his life start to get any betternow thats an interesting premise right there unfortunately it all went downhill so fast than you can imagine there are so many plot holes and rules that are left unexplained so many wacky expositions that just didnt work and bloated clichs one after anotherthe movie is somewhat salvaged however by the main leads performance domhnall gleeson rachel mcadams did an okay job by being the main leads romance interest and so does bill nighy the tone is consistent and the soundtrack is somewhat tolerable but thats all there is to itit is a good movie for a couple night but i advice you to watch for several minutes and just go have sex or sleep immediately,happy
this review is not intended for people intending to watch this movie who do not want to know some of the tricks or plot twists that it includes instead it is intended to provoke thought and consideration amongst those of us who like to watch a film with a critical eye and think about it afterwards i cannot believe the number of comments on this site along the lines of this film being wonderfulamazingthe best film ever i can only conclude that these remarks were made by people with limited experience of movies and  or who are very easily impressed i only hope that watchers of the film from overseas do not think that the actions of the characters in this movie represent typical british behaviour or that this film represents the standards of typical british movie makingmy first problem with this film concerns the way that the script appears to have been constructed by richard curtis i was tempted at times to shout out youre making it up as you go along in response to some of the twists in the plot such as when tim discovers that there were limits as to how far he could go back in time without changing the gender of his children why did his father simply not go back once again to when tim was 21 and comprehensively instruct him in the rules of time travel furthermore the characters are all stock caricatures who seem to have been chosen from other movies and then checked probably by a committee of jocastas and jeremys to be politically correct and inoffensive for example the playwright that tim stays with is mr sweary but lovely beneath the surface tims uncle is corpulent and forgetful but lovely beneath the surface and his work colleagues are sexist and incompetent but lovely beneath the surface have you spotted the common thread yet my next gripe concerns the whole idea of using time travel as a movie theme as it is hardly original  there are so many time travelbased movies that rachel mcadams herself has been in at least one the only point in taking on this theme which flies against one of the fundamental laws of the universe namely the second law of thermodynamics is if it says something new and interesting as this film contributes less than two of the classics in this genre from the last century namely groundhog day and back to the future and is less able to deal with the contradictions that arise than these films were merely highlights its inadequaciestim who is yet another caricature being a geeky ginger but naturally lovely beneath the surface makes poor use of the power that his ability to travel in time brings to him instead of either using it to make lots of money for example by visiting a casino or bookmakers which he could use to help those around him or to prevent fatalities or solve crimes he merely uses his abilities to improve his chatup lines selfishly when he gets the opportunity to prevent his sister from being involved in a serious car accident he decides not to take it as it results in his child being born a boy instead of a girl no this is not adequately explained either also if travelling back in time is so simple for tim that he can achieve it simply by going into a cupboard or small room closing his eyes and clenching his fists why had it not happened accidentally to him prior to his 21st birthday did he never close his eyes and clench his fists as a teenager furthermore how is it that he is able to carry his sister with him on one occasion  surely she can either travel or time on her own or not i would have been interested to know what the directors instructions to rachel mcadams were at the start of filming when she asked him what he wanted from her  presumably look pretty and say your lines dear as she delivers little else if a performance in a movie can be likened to a race she barely does more than jog throughout similarly domnhall gleeson was presumably told that he had to show one of two facial expressions namely either a look of surprise or a look of pretended surpriseoverall therefore this is a silly bland unoriginal little film about silly bland inoffensive caricatures living their silly bland nice lives,happy
it is a good movie you can watch it when you are boring but there is some inconsistencies i researched it for maybe i was wrong but there is no reasonable explanation so i think the producers didnt care so much maybe they wanted to focus on to the love and they succeed but whatever happens there is some inconsistencies and i think a quality movie shouldnt contradict with itself they created a movie about moving in the time but they didnt think over it they didnt tell all details and rules about it there are interesting characters in the movie and dramatically theme is created successful but as i said if you created a fantastic movie you cant break your own rules or you should give details and you should explain it,happy
i happened to have seen this last night on tv since i never seen it before and decided to check it out now this is a time travelling movie so time travel in movies can be sort of a hit and a miss the likes of back to the futurethe terminatoreven kate  leopold all use some sort of time travelling device in their films and sometimes it can be a little bit farfetchedin this film domhnall gleasonson of brendan gleasonplays tim a young man in his early 20s who has a family secret his fathergreat grandfather and granddad can all travel in time pastpresent or future so tim decides to use it to his advantage by going into a dark roomclosing his eyes and his fists tight and then he ends up going into another time frame things turn unexpectedly for the young lad as he ends up falling for an american named maryrachel mcadams who doesnt know that he can time travel so will something bad happen once he goes in and out of timebottom line i honestly thought this film was rather dull to be honest with you the time travelling made zero sense to me as all tim did was close his eyes and his fists tightly goes into dark room and bang his gone to another time frameif you like time travelling movies than check it out if not than avoid,happy
my opening review on imdb after using it for many years to confirm or reject my movie viewing choices this is the first time ever that i have been so out of sync with the imdb score that i feel compelled to say something i can not understand the high rating that this movie gets i really did not enjoy it at allhated the characters and the absurd and unreal world that they inhabit lacking any degree of charm and trying so so hard to be hip and cool maybe it is me but surely people do not converse in the manner portrayed here it was embarrassing to watch i like romcoms but this just left me coldit did not help that for me this film suffers badly by comparison to the charming effortless movie romantics anonymous that i had watched a few days earlierawful film,happy
why do people like this film its a romantic comedy without a plot the storyline is simple man decides to find a girlfriend finds one they marry have three children father of the man dies end of movie of course that is not enough to fill a movie so the director added a twist the father of the man told him when he turned 21 that the men of the family are able to travel back in time all they have to do is to step in a dark secluded space think of the memory they want to go back to and clench their fist and voil nice idea to fill the rest of the movie unfortunately their are so many flaws in the story it got annoying to me its a nice idea to travel back a few minutes maybe a day to redo something that could have been better but sometimes the steps are major and at some point the man finds out that his first child is now a son instead of daughter his father explains him he cant go back before the conception because if he changes the past just a tiny bit out comes a different child nevertheless unexplained is how he manages to get his daughter back another thing he can travel back in time but not forward so he has to relive his live with his changed past if this is only a few minutes it is quite all right and there is a funny scene in the movie where there has been taken advantage of that but to prevent that the movie will get boring by showing the reliving the director just skips to the present again so it looks like he travels forward in time as well but he doesnt you have to realize that for the major flaw in the end of the movie the man travels back to the moment his father is still alive and the father decides to have a fatherson moment so he travels some 20 years further back with his son to skip pebbles on the sea that is before the moment of conception of his three children so now the son a little boy has to relive his entire life remembering all the changes he made to his past to get where he was some 20 years later but the father will only tell him that he can travel in time when he will be 21 so by then he will probably have forgotten all his changes however the end of the movie shows he still managed to redo them all this simple romantic comedy has no plot the timetraveling part is infested with flaws so why do people like this film,happy
if i can go back to the past i want to go back like the main character but i dont want to do many time because it means that i spend irresponsible time so if i have super power like two man i want to use only one time when i regret the past mostly so i watch this film i notice that it is important to spend a day we cant extend time so we should make good use of our time we cant see our future of course so its interesting and make an effort to spend time also we cant go back the past we are alive not to regret so this film makes us notice that we should lead a full life and get happy so this movie is good,happy
what we can learn from that movie reallyi think its the realization that life cannot actually be relived twiceyou can watch yourself in a mirror and just knowwhether you want to go back and change everything even your daily routine thats a warningdo something turn your head around and look all those people desperately in love with life and not really being able to enjoy itwhether you look yourself in a mirror and know you are doing well then i think is time to close your eyes and let you gothats what i learn from this moviei think thats what main character want to show peoplethat life hasnt have to be complicated or perfect as a matter of fact,happy
this movie was nothing but filler and exposition all and i use this term lightly character development is delivered through narration there are so many filler scenes there is a scene that is literally a black screen with a time stamp and inconsequential filler conversations there is a scene where the female lead tries on dresses that builds to nothing there are a few okay jokes but most of the humour is just sex jokes that pander to sexually frustrated prudes nothing more then an isolated chuckle no gut laughs the plot is cringe worthy the protagonist has godly powers but uses them to hit on a women youd think hed use it to hone his passion or help humanity nope at one point his dad dies of cancer he could have cured cancer but nope the power of boners is stronger the performances are unbearably cheesy its not the fault of the actors its the fault of the script and director new writers are taught to show not tell apparently mr curtis missed the memo,happy
i was really hesitating between 6 and 7 so 65 would be my rating it is certainly cute but a number of mistakes inconsistencies and awkward almost cringeworthy moments kept me from enjoying the romance i think they went too far trying to make the main characters relatable it was too obvious and the age disparity between the leads was a little bit too much i also feel like the film had way too many messages like live in the now thing those might be really helpful if you are young and inexperienced but for a grown up it looked kind of corny like a talk between dad and son so long overduei find it really confusing this film has almost the same average rating as love actually even currently higher by 01 i mean that movie is perfect really i watched it a number of times and there is nothing i would change,happy
so then lets dive in for a quick one shall we a very ginger lanky clone of martin freeman crossed with ron from harry potter has a normal cornish bred lifestyle with a fairly upper middle low upper class family his father is a seemingly powerful yet carefree man his mother and sisterrelegated in his eyes as simplymother and sister however his love for them remains almost as strong as for his father his want of his approval his acceptance and guidance fore what son couldnt say the same or how pleased when a son gets just what he wants but in this case what the son gets is a milestone of knowledge a revelation of insight into a secret that leads to the very secret of life without so much as a grand fraternal initiation a bomb is dropped upon the son let loose by the father in the supposed jokeof time manipulation what joys what travels what merry may haves and have nots or maddening misfortunes naught had or not naught had occurred though from my standpoint there are many plot holes from a paradoxical minded persons point of view many things unrealistic  this movie in the whole one of them from a sci fi sci possiblists experience with the genre of mind expanding science bending ideas alas somehow as if the director could bend the ether themselves it turned out well a pull on ones own imagination on what could or shouldnt have been done showed me that i was driven to continue the tale that it worked to keep me watching not with action or great mayhem but simply with the most bizarrely calm  docile minded understandable fellow mans point of view and that was the point that was so miraculously well made laughs had a general lesson of enjoying the moment for it is the only true constant and real test of time no true past or future just other nows either gone by or yet to let fly in our eye but all in all a wonderful film to watch indeed temprus fugitbut only if you let it  pece,happy
its richard curtis youll hear richard curtis jokes youll see richard curtis embarrassing situations youll experience all the usual richard curtis kooky characters anyway whos watched love actually notting hill etc will not be surprised not one bitfortunately our man curtis is a bit of a virtuoso at this ol romantic comedy game and he deftly juggles the love story between this nervous but likable little twerp and his heartonsleeve yank girlfriend with the more science fictiony type stuff regarding time travel sure there a few plot holes here and there that whole thing about not being able to go back before your last child was born is a tad confused but overall its an original spin to staple on a bit of groundhog day style ingenuity into what could have been a standard formulaand sadly like the aforementioned bill murray starrer it does get more than a little corny towards the end and the long speeches about making the most of every day and how life is such a precious gift made me reach for my patented movie barf bucket it even has my name emblazoned on it and the unbelievably sentimental montage that accompanied them well and truly filled it theres a way to handle these no doubt imperative messages in a subtle underhand way not by slapping it on with a trowel complete with mood music in the backgroundstill its a true pleasure for the most part youll laugh youll cry youll hurl especially the last one 710,happy
ummm i really started watching it with a prejudice of richard curtis old creations like notting hill and four wedding and a funeral with a twist of time travel expected to be exciting from beginning onlya boy turns 21 and he came to know from his dad that he belongs to a family with mighty powers like traveling in time and he of course can tamper with the facts and facets if something went wronggot some disappointment there but dont know i kept watching and i really dont know why i kept watching so im leaving you here only please do tell me why you kept watching because im desperate to know other opinion why you kept watching,happy
overall lamethe best part about this movie is the father son relationship full of quirks as individuals and as a relationship the dynamic between the actors was beautiful to watch and the writing for these scenes was superb unfortunately that is where the praise ends theres no chemistry at all in the romantic relationships shown not least of which is the main couple the audience should be rooting for them to get together but sadly i found myself somewhere between not caring and thinking they were mismatched this same mismatch occurred with the sisters boyfriend and the guy she assumably marries why did she marry him theres zero chemistry this same thing happens with both sets of parents its like the casting director just grabbed four actors and said yeahwhateverthe story is slow and very little happens the scifi in this was unneeded and in fact detracted this is just another romcom with a lame scifi excuse to boost watchers disappointing,happy
if you expect about time is another romantic time traveling movie starring rachel mcadams after time travelers wife and midnight in paris you are dead wrongif you expect about time is another notting hill or love actually that directed by richard curtis you are also dead wrongthe truth is the main theme of this movie is not about romance but discussing the meaning of living so if you are looking for a movie with full of tearful and touching scenes that you can watch with your boyfriendhusband in bed romantically this is not your choicethe movie actually is not bad and i do like it but the lines are not so cleverhumorous comparing with others directedwritten by richard also i think the performance of rachel mcadams is quite limited by her role i feel this is such a waste for this big time romantic movie star to be nothing more than just a sweet and caring gfwife her character is capable of being something more bigger and more complicated and that would be something audiences would love to see,happy
overall the movie was fine but its a trap a lot of other reviewers said this was really interesting and a dudes chick flick well it isnt its a typical chick flick with the added feature of watching the same emotional heartfelt scene over and over and over ultimately the movie is good but not the hyped up best movie ever so when someone tells you how much you should watch this or you read it on your facebook feed i hope for your sake you read this review first and go into with the correct mindset enjoy oh apparently you have to have 10 lines in order to post a review listen imdb i dont intent to write anymore reviews but i did want to take the time after watching this movie to let my fellow men know whats coming,happy
the movie sails on smoothly through out with situations tailor made to suit genuinely to the fantasy element that carries the film the relations between the main lead and various persons in his life are depicted beautifully including the romance between the two main leads the situations that narrow down tims time traveling escapades are logical and intriguinghonestly i cant make out whether the plot was thought of in order to make the point that the movie makes at the end or it was just stumbled upon the end point during the development of the plotthe music composition enriches the situational mood completelyspoilers at times in the movie tim uses his time traveling to change certain mishaps so when he says at the end of the movie that he doesnt use time traveling anymore meaning that one doesnt need time traveling in order to be happy there seems to be a contradiction spoilers,happy
my wife says its the cutest thing ever and she usually has a point touching just cheesy enough some awkward moments didnt sit well with me at the start of the movie but as i went on i got hookedalso its not a love story if you were afraid of it its just a feelgood ride about the value of our ordinary lives excellent actors nice soundtrack was a bit long but didnt feel like itthe movie is more of a drama than a comedy that i was expecting but it suited it but it gives you a huge smile on your face at the end on the negative side the plot isnt about anything really but thats one of the points of the whole thingif you wanna get laid watch this with the missies ,happy

no you dont need a box of tissues what are you on about are we talking about about time na sir forget the tissues because you know why this movie is the guide to happiness after you watch it your out there living the live well he ended up happy cos not of his ability to travel back in time at the first place you just got to be there to do that i am lucky to have both my parents still but i know they wont be there forever watch it twice or more if you dont receive the message but is guru to happiness is the way it is but in the end it does not matter if you make the most of it today without trying to revert back in time then you dont even have to travel back in time youd enjoy the journey ahead and never look back you got to appreciate these actors for that thanka,happy
i tried to avoid as many reviews on this movie before sitting down to watch it myself i saw a few scores and a couple of positives beforehand one being that domhnall gleeson was being dubbed as the new hugh grant which was a pleasant surprise i seemed to avoid reviews and ultimately spoilers a little too well and before viewing i didnt even know that this was a richard curtis movie another pleasant surprisethe comparisons to his previous work were always on the cards and although i tried to see this as a separate movie with the added time travel element giving it a nice futuristic twist i still made the comparisons in my mind and mr gleesontim is a very good leading man in the genre and i can see him going on to bigger and better things probably under the wing of mr curtis which im sure wed all love to seethis movie kept me hooked all the way through i tried to predict what was going to happen but with the time travel aspect i was constantly left befuddled and bill nighy was as brilliant as ever as the doting father left to divulge the family secret to his sonthe story seemed to progress at an alarming rate moving on through marriage new additions to the clan a death and yet more children ultimately showing us the roadblock in the time travel venture and leaving tim to appreciate each day as it is and not try to alter anythingsimply a remarkable movie a credit to richard curtis who already has some masterpieces under his belt,happy
i thought this one as a normal science fiction film but its more than thatit started as a romantic story and turned into a film which depicts relationships beautifully this movie doesnt deals much about the time travel and its related puzzlesits been given to the user to use his own imagination and reasoning i really liked the humor in the dialogs throughout the movie the characters have been plotted wellthe father character is one of the fine things about this movie but i dont know why he always comes with folded fingers the heroine the same one from time travelers wifehas done a pretty good job the last ten minutes make this movie worth watching twice,happy
the movie is meant to impress you and show you that you already know how to live your life perfectly by living in the moment however it fails in the fact that it has so many inconsistencies on some cases tim the main character absolutely cant travel back in time because it might cause him to have a different baby in the future so there is a dramatic scene of his last visit with his father and so on and in the next scene he actually does travel back to his childhood regardless of his future babies because he is going to be very careful so why cant he be very careful when he goes back to see his dad again or the thing about his dads cancer its really hard for me to accept that someone wont go back in time and fix his smoking issues to avoid cancer in the future simply because he wants to give up so why doesnt he go back in time and hire a hitman to shoot him at a certain age that he sees proper for him to die or just simply jump off a cliff and the thing about money tim wont travel back in time to become rich because his granduncle did it and money cause everyone to hate him but thats again stupid youd think of a solution to become fairly provided without doing too much work also its an insult to the rich class of people this means you are all hated by everyone around you yes i know all you 79 raters would say oh you dont get it  the movie is not about these childish details   but i see these weak points in the story as lack of ability of the writer he could come up with another idea to stop tim from travelling back in time for money something like its inhumane its like stealing from other people and for example his dad could make him swear that he would never do that  or something other than a weak reason i think the main message of the story is beautiful but it failed in giving me a consistent movie with strong details oh and rachel mcadams is gorgeous and amazing as always ,happy
one of the best movies i watched in this year it was supposed to show in us but some theater canceled it for some reason so i have to wait for its dvd people who just watched trailer might think this is just another love drama which boy kept traveling back on time to make his life perfect and give the girl perfect romance or someone might think this movie is just another butterfly effect you travel back things changed life get messed up and so on however this one is totally different it is more than that the only thing this movie want to tell is that we cant travel back in time so we have to enjoy our life everyday so we will never feel regret and also we should cherish all the people we love tell them how important they are before too late this movie is so touching warm and romantic rachel is so beautiful youll never regret to watch it,happy
how fortunate we are that richard curtis exists and that he has discovered the recipe for great feelgood movies  this is one for the books ive just finished watching it and all i can say to the person who reads this is watch it  all in all it was not at all what i expected from a time travel film but it was most definitely a good surprise the story follows the life of tim who discovers at the age of 21 that he can travel back in time through the storyline the film just reminds you in a very gentle and intelligent way that life should be cherished and to not forget it the whole cast is brilliant and the three main characters especially are fabulously portrayed by bill nighy rachel mcadams and domhnall gleeson the soundtrack is inherently british which to me made it that more enjoyable i very rarely comment on imdb but i just feel that this movie deserves it  i trade me laugh it made me cry it made me want to hug my whole family  anyway if you watch it i just hope you enjoy it as much as i did ,happy
this film is for those who really enjoys a romcom if you dont but watch it based on the rating here you are just wasting your time stop criticizing the movie if you cant even tell what is a good romcomand for those who likes romcom you will definitely not going to regret ive waited so long for a movie like this funny but not silly touching but not clich i got goose bumps while watching this movie and that usually happens only when i was listening to good musicthis movie has taught me to take more attention to the world we are living in and cherish every one that you love and loves you its something great when a movie is able to transmit so many feelings and makes you realize how beautiful is your life its all about time,happy
ive watched this movie yesterday with my wife and we both enjoyed it very much the story is about a family whose men can time travel the plot focus the life of the younger son whos desperate for finding a girlfriend and also how he uses his travel time powers to change his past actions in order to get a girl it also covers his relationship with his sister and specially his father the movie is full of fun moments making the movie enjoyable and light to watch but at the same time explores a sentimental  emotional side that will leave your eyes wetdefinitely a must see movie,happy
when i saw this movie on the billboards i thought it will be another over soapy sappy and sentimental love story we have already heard of gazillion times as a scifi fan in general i was reluctant but i was forced to go and it was starspangled awesome i really liked the way the background of tim was presented all the gloss of the upper middle class it is a classic act delivered in a cheering and well balanced mannerthe talk between tim and his dad grands the young lad a magic pill to relieve him from burden and anxiety this is a conversation every manincluding me has to carry with his father but in this movie dad comes with a special shortcut magic pill  time travel is it so simple if we only had a second third hundredth chance to do something will we and when we will stop imagine that you had some great moment will you want to experience it forever this time travel provoked a thought process about how certain things would be if i go back and relive certain parts of my life without the hesitation and passivenessthe lesson i learned from this movie is to look at ourselves in a more relaxed and peaceful way and seize the moment as it deserves to be seized,happy
even though the argument could be well theyre playing a younger person then their real age it just doesnt wash when the age difference of the actor in real life couldnt possibly pass for a 2021 year oldin this movie rachel mcadams meets a young man who has just turned 21 well just assume shes in that same low age rangecmon shes a 35 year old woman playing someone 15 years her junior nope too old for this role period plenty of actresses that would have done a lovely job in the right age group thats the trouble with ms mcadams shes been in too many movies where audiences know her too well and how old she isif its not believable then it ruins any hope of the movie being enjoyable time travel movies are one of my favorites but you have to like multiple travels into the past every time theres a small hitchgood for a onetime watch only and fix the small black lamp shade in the hallway,happy
i saw this movie last nightand i didnt know what to expecthaving watched many time travel movies this was a very different and it was inspiring i grew up watching films like the back to the future trilogy one of my favorite films but these one left me surpriseda movie with beautiful visuals and a different method for time travel no delorean time machine neededbut i liked how with the assistance of time travel tim was able to correct the mistakes he ever done in life and how he ended creating a happy reality a similar twist was explored in the 1993 movie groundhog day with bill murray as phil connors a meteorologist who gets caught reliving the same day over and over until he finally fixes everything that was wrong with his life something that happened with tim in these case but with a different time travel methodvery nice movie i really cared for everything that was going on and the actors really did a wonderful job and the ending was greatthis is why i go to the movies to have a wonderful time,happy
one of the exhilarating feels as a film fan is knowing when youve seen a modern classic a film that breaks a threshold to the next level about time is one of those filmswhat makes the film great is this with the history of time travel films i expected things to go wrong for tim halfway through the film where time travelling would change his future and this abuse of power would cost him his life with mary leading him to change the past more and change it back at a certain point of the film after changing the past for his sister i was convinced hed walk in the door to find himself married to his blond first love charlotte in ohno fashion but this never happens the effect of time travel never spins out of control for tim and in fact much of his life proceeds as if he hardly needed it time travel helps tim fall in love with mary but he met her originally and set up a date without it marriage the birth of children and death proceeds as they would have his sisters life falls apart and her brother helps puts her back together with persuasion and not time travel tims professional life appears to be perfectly normal and unaffected by his powersso whats richard curtis doing why make a time travel film to tell a story that could survive without it and where it never enacts a price on its user because this is the point the great parts of tims life  falling in love children family and enjoying day to day arent because of his time travel he succeeds by using his powers to live an ordinary life and the great parts that come with it by the end he doesnt even use it anymore tims journey real life and the people in it is what makes it extraordinary not travelling in timethe title of the film about time is perfect before seeing the film it sounds as if thats referring to time travel but in reality its about the passage of time from the start of tims journey to the end its really about life tims life and journey and the humanity of it represents all of ours like much great fantasy films or television it uses a fantastical concept to show us real things about ourselvesas if this wasnt enough about time is a superbly made film with this and love actually i havent seen pirate radio richard curtis proves he is as talented a director as writer the film is beautifully shot both filming its characters and its setting to great effect the dialogue and performances are exceptional and on point making incredibly lovable characters it exudes warmth about time is a film is a terrifically crafted and directed film in a way less likely to get credit compared to a gravity or 12 years a slave the 32 of critics on rottentomatoescom that graded this a subpar film frankly have lost the plot of how to judge filmmaking they are simply wrongabout time is a near perfect film for its genre following in the footsteps of love actually 10 years ago its a modern classic and one of the best films of the last 5 or 10 years,happy
you know that saying they dont make em like that anymore you cant say that after watching this movie a wonderful film that touches your heart and makes you want to appreciate life more they could not of cast this movie more perfectly i havent seen domhnall gleeson any other movies before but i can tell you after this performance i will be on the lookout for his movies the commercials were saying that this was rachel mcadams best performance since the notebook and i could not agree more rachel and domhnall had perfect chemistry on screen i dont know how anyone could rate this under a 10 this movie will be added to my collection go see it,happy
this movie was on my watch list ever since i watched the trailer i knew it was a sweet romance movie but when i finally stepped in the cinema and watch it was very heart warming and touching more than ive expected its inspiringdespite given the ability to relive the past and dwell in it one has to simply move on manage the present and build the future with the loved ones to live with the imperfects and have a good memory about them tim could have let mary have a drier wedding but they got all the way with the all messed up but memorable weddingthe movie was mostly narrated by tim the lead role in the movie as it was about his life the genre of the movie was not set to hit the box office but the casts made viewers feel like living in the story itself the acts were solid that you could have believed it was realthe plot was rather flat but we dont expect ups and downs in a persons life to keep it practical the love is inspiring i would not mind to spend on another ticket just to repeat the movie,happy
you can call it a chick flick if you want but this is purely amazing very rarely do you find a modern love story with some far out characters humor and deep meaningful emotions that all revolve around love and time travel in the style of being john malkovich groundhog day midnight in paris and some nicholas sparks flick with a british flare the family secret of time travel creates a unique story that is superbly entertaining you will either walk out the theater with a smile on your face or complain that rachel mcadams is always in those kind of movies the characters kit kat played by lydia wilson portrays the free flowing sister is hilarious and warm vanessa kirby plays joanna the friend of mcadams who sparkles in every one of her scenes as the love story begins to take hold i hope to see this one several more times,happy
direction theres not many times that i ridiculously disagree with critics as a whole because 60 on rotten tomatoes doesnt even come close to how awesome richard curtis about time really is about time is absolutely charming very funny and explores the entire emotional spectrum really well curtis is very straight forward with his story but its massively engaging and entertaining one scene involves a band playing at a train station playing a lovely romantic song as the main characters come back and forth as time keep passes by curtis creative scenes like that stand out create a fun environment and set the tone well the actual time travel is uniquely done too and is used for great humor in many cases curtis use of music is done extremely well too and is really appropriate for the different emotional tones we get this is easily the best romcom of 2013 and is one to seegrade ascript the story is pretty straight forward for the most part but does have some complexity to it later on in the story the story centers around tim domhnall gleeson who discovers the men in his family can travel back in time and as a youthful man love is the big thing on his mind he moves from the countryside of england to the city of london where he meets mary rachel mcadams and everything changes tim realizes that he can uses his time travel to redo things without many negative consequences which is really convenient but throughout the story we do find that there are some negative consequences if hes not careful with what he chooses as it does affect his future on some level what makes this story brilliant is that its not very hollywood this is where many critics miss the point its too predictable that tim would use time travel to do dumb things mess up his life bring in drama but then fix everything at the end thats what we need again right wrong in fact curtis sets up those moments really well but instead we get a guy who learns to have fun with his time travel but hes smart and knows exactly what he wants its the straight forwardness you wouldnt expect instead of it being filled with hollywood drama we get a story thats fun extremely hilarious and emotional all at the same time and its not just a love story the love aspects blend so well with the fatherson relationship story that is just riveting this story is uniquely told by curtis and ultimately its not about the time travel but how one can miss the important details that life can wonderfully makegrade aperformances easily one of the funnies performances of the year and wonderfully made for the actors to just have a lot of fun with what they are dong domhnall gleeson is amazing as tim hes the shy awkward young man who doesnt know exactly how to talk to women but knows that love is what he wants hes really believable as the character and he shines he especially shines in scenes with bill nighy who plays tims father gleeson and nighy have some great chemistry and both bring some refreshing humor to the movie rachel mcadams is beautiful and while she doesnt have as much to do shes great for the role she plays theres one specific scene where she tries on about 20 different dresses thats just brilliant lydia wilson who plays kit kat tims younger sister and shes really funny as the crazy sibling who brings life to the screen all the rest of the supporting cast is great as well and only brings more humor and life to what this movie is trying to do if you dont have fun with this cast and story critics im talking to you then youre really missing the point amazinggrade ascore nick lairdclowes doesnt have a ton on his resume but here lairdclowes has some really great melodies that play throughout the film his main theme is absolutely gorgeous and we hear it many times that just elevates this movie even further add to that an amazing soundtrack list that is full of some really great songs that accompany the film tremendously the music is crucial in many parts of the film that either bring fun or an emotional element that is really great go seek out the music its really goodgrade afinal thoughts about time isnt a movie about time travel while its the main premise of the film its really a film about relationships yes perhaps time travel lets them play out the way you want but who wouldnt want that and who wouldnt want to spend some more time with their father or people they love if they could its the type of story that is just a lot of fun filled with laughter and is what we all hope for if you want a dramafilled heart attack go watch the walking dead about time is perfect for what its trying to dooverall grade a,happy
when tim domhnall gleeson learns from his father bill nighy that the men in his family have the ability to go back in time he immediately laughs it off but when he travels back to one night on new years eve he then realizes his abilities tim then takes initiative to use his abilities to gain the one thing he desiresa girlfriend in this process he meets mary rachel mcadams after a few awkward encounters tim finally manages to win her heart but in the process he also learns there some things in life that cannot be changeddirector richard curtis who brought us such films as love actually notting hill and bridget jones diary comes another memorable film in his collection what appears to be a typical romantic film that appears very reminiscent of the time travelers wife also starring mcadams but in reality there is so much more to it than that the love story is just another aspect of the film what we are given is a story of a young man who learns of just how much he is capable of with his abilities and the choices he has to overcome with them the story can go from charming and funny to deep and emotional with such ease that only curtis can do as seen through his aforementioned films we are also given a very talented cast to help give the story life domhnall gleeson stars as our main star gleeson portrays the awkward but often charming character perfectly that we cant help but relate to his best scenes however come between him and billy nighy who plays his very funny and spirited father as we watch their scenes together their relationship as father and son is so believable that its always a treat to see them together finally we have the wonderful rachel mcadams this time around we have a more charming bubbly and often comical version of herself as opposed to the usual character she plays in films such as this mcadams reminds us just why she has such a large fan base and why shes one of americas sweethearts the chemistry between gleeson and mcadams is also something to be noted while their relationship is more fun and sweet as opposed to romantic they play this off perfectly their scenes together are cute to watch its not dynamite chemistry by any means but its enjoyable to see the two clearly having fun togetherabout time is charming deep and emotional with great substance to it than what the trailers give off its cast also does an amazing job of pulling the viewer in especially gleeson and nighy all under the brilliant as always vision by richard curtismy rating 810,happy
about time perhaps not the first movie which includes time traveling in a romantic movie but its the most successful one i guess at first audience could be quite confuse of this time traveling thing it isnt explained clearly and seems illogical however the movie flows smoothly that make people forget about that thing and enjoy the story once again richard kurtis as director and writer has emphasized that he is the one for romantic comedy drama after a clever combination sweet drama in love actually about time is unexpectedly sweet and no wonder some audiences admittedly cry during seeing this some scenes feel really emotional though the movie is not only focus in the relationship between tim and mary but also the relationship with his family also fine performance and chemistry from their entire casts have raised the sweetness from this movie overall about time is sweet and some scenes are quite hilarious it is undeniably the best comedy romantic drama so far in 2013 really suitable movie for family or couple a must see,happy
about time starts as a comedy about time traveling man and his quest for true love or any love at all but after a while the movie goes into a drama territory with surprising emotional resonance actually it is a movie about life and the possibilities of coping with everything that goes with it happiness sadness comedy and tragedy tha powers of our hero come with a limitations and as in real life it is difficult and sometime impossible to achieve winwin situation but time travel in this movie is a secondary thing more important is one simple message that is very difficult to follow in life and that is to accept everything as it comes and to seize every moment in life like it is the last one,happy
about time is the story of a slightly socially inept your man tim lake domhnall gleeson at the age of 21 his father reveals the family secret all the men in the family can travel back in time basically having their current consciousness temporarily present in younger versions of themselves tim decides to use this ability to get a girlfriend which at first does not work out so well however when he later meets mary rachel mcadams his abilities come in handy to get a crucial first date to work out wellthe movie goes on to tell the story of tim and marys relationship and tim learning the usefulness and limitations of his time traveling to help himself and others along the way there are many humorous moments some that work better than others along with some truly poignant moments such as the day when tim has to say goodbye for the very last time to his beloved fatheri saw about time in a preview showing last week and came with hopes for a good movie but wondered how raw the movie would be it is rated r and if it would have all of the typically romantic comedy clichs i found it to be in general a pleasant movie to watch with characters that i genuinely came to feel like i knew and lovedwhile a relatively minor part of the movie some will be put off a bit by some vulgar language a few isolated sex related jokes and the frequent off screen premarital sex that leads to one couple getting married due to an unplanned pregnancy there are a couple of scenes in which mary is shown in her underwear once topless but covering herself with her hands such that nothing is visible i was actually a bit puzzled that the movie was rated r since most of this material was not much different from what you can see any day on basic cable televisiondomhnall gleeson did a convincing job of portraying tim as a genuinely nice guy who cares about other people and goes out of his way to help people when he can rachael mcadams is pleasant as mary and she and tim make a nice couple on screen i was pleasantly surprised that the movie avoided some of the romantic comedy formula by not having an artificial way to separate and then later get the couple back together the interactions between tim and his dad wonderfully played by bill nighy were touching and realistic not counting the whole time travel thingto sum up the movie was fun interesting and really much more pleasant to watch than i had initially thought it might be it was a true science fantasy movie in that it took ordinary people introduced a fantastic concept and then let things play out in a fairly realistic way in the end it also had some surprisingly worthwhile things to say about the importance of making the right choices and living life to the fullest but did it without hitting you over the head with it i would gladly see it again sometime and recommend that you strongly consider going to see it yourself,happy

when i saw the trailer to this movie i knew it was something that i wanted to see i was delighted when i received tickets to an early premiere to see it before its release and i was blown away this movie is funny and sweet and touched my heart its one of the best romantic comedies ive seen in some time but its only 50 about romantic love the other half of this movie to me was about the love you have for your family and the lengths you will go to for that love domhnall gleeson is adorable in this film i have my first crush on a ginger after seeing this movie the chemistry between he and rachel mcadams is fantastic if you want to see a movie that teaches you something about love and a little something about how to live your life run and see this film on nov 8thyoull be glad you did,happy
my girlfriend and i took in this movie last night in victoria bc we both really enjoyed it as long as you can get past the time traveling idea and dont argue that point the movie is surprising with its effortless wit amazing cast great locations and beautiful character driven story the story begins with tim played by domnhall gleeson reminds me of a young redheaded hugh grantwho is a rather nervous awkward young man who is told by his father he can time travel back to any point within his life in fact all males in tims family can do thisyou quickly take this information in as reality tim than experiments with his newly acquired ability to go after the thing he desires most in life to fall in love mary rachel mcadams is tims love interest she is cute adorable real and so much more to single out any actor would be a travesty every actor in this film is just superb i give this movie 89 out of 10 rounding up to 9 i highly recommend this film,happy
when i get together with my friends sometimes we always have the discussion that i think most people have with their friends that conversations about what super power you would choose if you could choose one oh wait that is just me and my friends anyway the one thing i wish i could do is to be able to travel back in time i dont want to be able to change history just to be able to have a redo on something i did well that will never happen but is exactly what about time is abouttim domhnall gleeson has just turned 21 and his father bill nighy has a family secret to tell him it is nothing like something evolving a dark secret in their past the secret is that the men of their family can travel back in time this secret is met with disbelief and doubt and of course the desire to find out if it is true tim decides to go back to the night before at his parents new years eve party and kisses a girl at midnight something he missed on the first time what would you do with such a gift get rich make your life perfect for tim his choice is to use it for love tim now armed with this new ability heads to london to start his life and to find his true love it is not long after that he meets mary rachel mcadams and tim uses his gift to correct his mistakes in his courting of her tim and mary start a life together and a family and tim discovers that living everyday to its fullest is truly the secret for a happy lifei know what you are thinking a love story about time travel the time travelers wife all over again well i have good news for you even though they both have rachel mcadams in common that is the only thing they share what makes about time different well that is simple it is written and directed by richard curtis love actually curtis knows how to tell a love story he just seems to make the relationships in his movie feel real we have all heard the only in the movies line before but curtis makes it feel real about time has that feeling from the awareness of the first time meeting someone to the feeling you get when you meet the right person as good as curtiss material is it would all be for nothing if it didnt have the right actors gleeson and mcadams are magical together and you cant help to especially enjoy gleesons preference there are so many movies dealing with love and relationships that come out every year some are funny some are sad but most of them get it wrong because things that happen in those movies dont happen in real life well with about time you get something that feels real and if that is not enough you get one of the better movies about love that you will see all year and it is about time for thatbrian taylor httpthe2cinemenblogspotcom,happy
unlike any love story ive experienced up to now this movie allows us to connect through the eyes of tim the meaningful and substantive love he felt for the precious souls in his life of which there were many mainly his lifepartner mary his bohemian sister and the sweet relationship he shared with his father the performance by every single actor was superb i wanted to be a part of this world and now miss my new friends made while living life through tim what i took from this movie was the awakening to realize how precious and meaningful every day is that i am given and to mark each moment with gratitude and joy it teaches us to see that our cup is always at least half full or overflowing its been a very long time since i could say this this movie is definitely listed in my top ten favorite movies of all times sharing the spotlight with legends like gone with the wind wizard of oz shawshank redemption and up two thumbs way up,happy
having just made my account and this being my first review you can probably tell that something must have caused me to do so this film caused just that i have never seen any more of richard curtis films yes not even love actually but i have to say this is one of the greatest british romcoms i have ever seen i originally was going to see prisoners on the same day but im glad i saw this instead yes strangely this film does incorporate time travel but this isnt the be all of it for me the most aweinspiring moments were the ones between gleeson tim and mcadams mary as they both managed to create a very believable and at many points hilarious couple the timetravelling concept was well thought through and was excellently executed in this flick with a message that touched my heart of course i also enjoyed the most important relationship in this movie between tim and his father nighy and felt it was a accurate portrayal of the modern day british father and son and was believable the film also engages us in the many struggles of and british adolescent turning into a man and of course the many perks of doing so relatable believable and overall very quirky i felt this film was a great addition to the often overlookedbymen romcom genre some have said this film is slowpaced but at no point in the movie was i bored or did i even turn to a friend and discuss how bad it was it occasionally was a little slow but i believe this gave me time to really appreciate some of the more affectionate moments of the film,happy
our lives here on earth are measured in time but what if we could guarantee that every second was well spent for tim domhnall gleeson this becomes a reality when on his twentyfirst birthday his father bill nighy reveals to him that he along with the males in their family has the ability to time travel we follow tim as he leaves the breathtakingly presented cornwall in search for a different life in london and more importantly a girlfriend while displaying the fantastical element of time travel about time is firmly rooted in its tale of humanity tim encounters the wonderful mary rachel mcadams by chance and it is the unfolding of their relationship that forms the narrative of the film family life and love intervene masterfully to present their domestic life that i invested hugely in where small actions through time traveling can lead to huge consequences the performances are sublime domhnall gleeson demonstrates the ability of an extremely likable leading man rachel mcadams embodies the insecurities perfectly of a woman who does not know how perfect she is and bill nighy is simply in his element on the one hand i wish more romantic comedies were like this but on the other i dont as that is what makes this film so unique genuinely clever extremely witty and so full of heart,happy
about time is about a guy and his changes in life when his dad reveals a secret that the men in the family can travel back in time as the website states  a new funny film about love with a bit of time travel the scifi tag is just a lame excuse the movie begins as a scifi continues as a romcom and ends as a family drama richard curtis known for writing love actually and notting hill is the writer and director of about time produced by working title films and released by universal pictures the movie stars domnhall gleeson rachel mcadams and bill nighy in major roles who wouldnt be excited to watch a scifi romcom from richard curtis with a promising trailer which reveals most but misdirectsyoull know when you actually watch the filmtimdomnhall gleeson has this immense ability to travel back in time he uses it to find the love of his life comical reliefs happen when tim foolishly uses it to make others lives happier rachelmcadams is adorable as mary though i wish zooey deschanel has taken up this role what works in the film is the prime character tim and his relationships with the people around the time he spends with his dad when hes flirtatious with mary and when he takes care of his sister kit kat all these relationships is what keeps the movie going the supporting cast are adorable ones like the hippie sis kit katlydia wilson and the paranoid playwright harrytim hollander sir richard griffiths has a minor yet memorable role in this moviethere are major plot flaws in the movie the dad says that only the men can travel back in time but at a point tim takes his sister back to where she met her boyfriend the other secret which the dad reveals later in the movie is that one cannot travel back once a child is born as it would lead to the birth of a completely new child however we see the father and the son go back in time when tim was a child and still things are normal in the future the comedy writer in richard curtis couldnt resist from breaking his rules to create some brilliant dramaabout time is a frivolously written scifi script by richard curtis which is otherwise a heart whelming romantic drama its about time you watch it on screens near you,happy
about time stars domhnall gleeson as tim a socially awkward young adult who finds out he can travel in time within his own past and decides to use his powers to find love the target of his pursuits is the also somewhat awkward mary rachel mcadams there are definitely some issues regarding the specific mechanics of the time travel but it is not a big issue since this is a romantic comedy with time travel elements and not a scifi film about time travel it seems that the film will be a sort of selfinduced groundhog day with repeated attempts to make mary fall in love with tim surprisingly the time travel mechanic is not used much in the second half of the film it is only used two or three timesthis film is a romantic comedy meaning it has to check two important boxes romance and comedy there is definitely chemistry between the leads tim and mary are very similar they are both a bit socially awkward shy but also very witty the dialogue between them highlights their similarities and feels very real romance check the dialogue in the film overall is fantastic with its british dry wit contributing greatly to the comedy are the supporting characters surrounding tim and mary like tims quirky freespirited sister or his bitter playwright of a landlord the scenes between tim and his father bill nighy are some of the best in the film every character is unique and quirky almost to a fault comedy check where the movie fails however is the plot and plot structure which is unfortunate considering the interesting concept a tried and true format for films is to have an overarching conflict that the protagonist tries to solve throughout the film with many obstacles along the way this keeps the audience invested in every scene this film does not do that rather is an episodic series of minor conflicts there are a scene or two of conflict introduction then a scene of the conflict being resolved and then a scene or two of just tim and mary just being in love repeat the conflicts rarely involve tim and marys relationship at all for better or for worse it isnt the incredibly formulaic romantic comedy plot structure and on paper this format actually makes sense in keeping with the themes of the film  living life and appreciating lifes ups and downs but this does not translate to screen well the lack of central tension results in boredom also it means there isnt much of a character arc to tim therefore when the movie ends it just sort of happensspeaking of the ending the similarity between this film and richard curtis earlier success love actually 2003 is very noticeable firstly the ending of about time is stylistically identical to the opening of love actually complete with a disembodied voice talking about life and love over shots of random residence of london the plot missteps can also be traced to the 2003 film love actually is an ensemble comedy with each character having their own conflict and resolution lacking one central conflict it works in that film because there is no central protagonist about time on the other hand is a single protagonist film with a multiprotagonist film structureoverall the film is enjoyable despite its shortcomings there are plenty of embarrassing and hilarious situations that tim finds himself in and for those looking for romance tim and marys relationship is exactly what you want but the film couldve been so much more with a better structure to the plot and better use of the underutilized time travel aspect,happy
about time was much better that i expected it to bei didnt like the idea of time travelling in a romcom and expected it to be a very poor film i wouldnt of even gave this film a second thought only for my girlfriend really wanted to see it so i went in expecting the worst and came out pleasantly surprisedafter i got over the whole idea of time travel i saw what this film really is a very well told story with plenty of humour along the way bill nighy tims dadis excellent throughout the film and fills the story with the witty lines that break up the serious scenes definitely worth a watch if you can make yourself ignore the time travel aspect of things 710,happy
one of the best romantic comedies that i have seen in the last few years very good capture of both cornwall and london and the relationship between tim and his father the great bill nigh y done nicely overall a film i recommend to fans of london as well as love actually and romantic comedies i was glad that tim goes back a couple of times during the scene at the national theater in glorious southbank also some nice music in the movie also nick cave fitted nicely towards the end of the movie last 1015 minutes were quite moving the relationship with tim and mary was also nice nothing over the top and his relationship with his sister also nice the parts in the national theather were also nice not over the top at points the movie does feel a little like groundhog day but its more of a romantic comedy compared to groundhog day nice cinema outing for romantic comedy and london lovers ,happy
about time takes place in the cosy romantic britain of richard curtis where nervous middle class englishmen fall head over heels for gorgeous american women curtis paints an idealised london of lawyers playwrights art galleries and vintage fashion in the midst of it all is aspiring young lawyer tim domhnall gleeson who arrives in the capital with new ambition and a new abilityfor tim has just been told the family secret by his father bill nighy he along with all the other men in his family is a time traveller and can rewrite his own history by travelling back to any point along his own timeline but no killing hitler nighys matteroffact exposition on this matter starts the film along with tims natural incredulity it is a comic highlightbut this is a richard curtis project and tims future is not a chronicle of epic destiny but a chance for him to finally meet the girl of his dreams she arrives swiftly in the form of the expatriated mary rachel mcadamsgleeson shines as an atypical leading man red haired slightly gangly at once identifiable and appealing to the audience mcadams is pleasant but her character is given little to do notably she never discovers tims big secretmuch of the humour comes from tims courtship of mary during which he repeats awkward encounters and must meet her for the first time more than once including a memorable date in londons famously pitchblack dans le noir restaurant a nifty cinematic experimentthe approach is reminiscent of that other great time travelling romantic comedy the thoroughly brilliant groundhog day 1993 but tim has a blessing not a curse and with complete control over his path approaches with less cynicism and more lets try that again shall weso the blend of time travel with a romantic comedy is not entirely original there is also an inevitable comparison with the time travellers wife 2009 which also starred rachel mcadams maybe shes stuck in a time loop herselfas for specifics the film directly asks you not to question it too much we dont seem to have destroyed civilisation yet says nighy some rules rear their head as the narrative progresses but its hard to know what the boundaries actually are and i just watched primer 2004this is not a film about time travel but a romantic comedy in which time travel furthers the plot but it is about time how we choose to spend it and who we choose to spend it with and while its a romance on the face of things the more interesting relationship and certainly the more poignant is between tim and his fatherat times its unashamedly sentimental the entire film has a softness to it that makes you wonder if curtis smeared vaseline on the lens curtis even manages to turn a potentially day ruining downpour into a fresh and glorious celebrationthe strength of the writing is in the ability to remain unexpected and some of this is naturally due to the ability of time travel to allow unexpected things to happen conflict appears in unlikely places and least of all in the relationship between gleeson and mcadamsits not perfect but for all the derivative and saccharine elements the central fatherson relationship is eloquent and something rarely explored in this way especially with this level of british reserve though the script is witty it is only peppered with outright comedy this is still gold from the versatile tom hollander fantastic as a jaded slovenly playwright to tims swift cycle through a series of potential best men complete with appropriate speechesbeing relatively unfamiliar with his previous works aside from classic television shows blackadder and the vicar of dibley about time has at the very least inspired me to investigate richard curtiss other films which are apparently much stronger,happy
im sure there are many who sneered at richard curtiss recent movie called about time for its simplicity and melancholy but i was not one of them rather than sneer as others have done i took into account his previous work such as notting hill and bridget jones and therefore expected nothing more than a simple feel good british romcom if i wanted to see more of a complex film than i would of opted for the works of james cameron for example or generally a director of a entirely different mind who is talented in other respects the fault lies not within the film itself but within those members of the audience who are trying to find a greater meaning than intended even the trailer makes about time reminiscent of richard curtiss other films as we see a romance blossom between tim and marry  so my question is if you are not a fan of the heartwarming feel good british romcom then why see it in the first place and criticise it for being exactly this afterwardsif you take the film for precisely what it is and nothing more than i can find little to criticise the film of course had all the characteristics of your typical british romcom with tim lake the hopeless romantic the numerous laughoutloud moments but what i consider it to have more than any of his other films is emotion rather than it simply being about finding that special someone it is about the moments we all take for granted as we too like tim are all at fault of being overly consumed in the hustle bustle of everyday life this leaves little time to appreciate each and every moment each and every exchange with our loved ones and as we along with tim learn the importance and beauty in doing so our heartstrings are played like a violin once you put what is likely considered as naff to the side this is a film that will make you tearful to say the least unless you have a heart of stone and it is this i praise about time for its ability to pull at the heartstrings to such an extent i expect after seeing the trailer you may not think a hanky is in need but believe me you really dont want to be without oneto be fair i would not overly praise richard curtis but i find it difficult to dispute his films are exactly what they say on the tin and i know i am not alone in having those moments where all i want to do is sit down watch a nice heartwarming film to escape from the drudgery of everyday life in these moments despite its naffness about time and films like it do have a place within all of our hearts however much some try and dispute this so why should this film not be praised for offering us this escape and capturing the beauty of life that we allow to pass us by,happy

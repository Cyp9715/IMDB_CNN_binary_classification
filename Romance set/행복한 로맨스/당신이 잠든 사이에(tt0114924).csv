you have to be the most diehard unrelenting cynic not to enjoy this movie i love it when television networks play this film around wintertime because for some reason it doesnt suit any other time of year in winter you like to have a comfort zone and this film is it it tells the story of lonely singleton lucy who daydreams of better things while working at a ticket booth and drooling over the secret crush of a local commuter peter gallagher one morning she saves him from a coming train and while he lies comatose she gets reluctantly cosy with his family the deceit is understandable and by no means menacing as its christmas the younger brother jack bill pullman returns home and subsequently falls for lucy is beautiful and sweet in so many ways you are reminded of the more oldfashioned romances of the 40s and 50s there is not one hint of sexuality or lust in this as the love blossoms between jack  lucy is honest pure and all together endearing we all relate to lucy on some level a dream trip to paris rome or in this case florence so its hopeful to us all when she gets her happy ending i absolutely loved it,happy
i adore this movie its easily one of my favourites another reviewer said that the best time to watch it is in the winter and whilst im happy to watch it any time of the year i would agree that it seems all the more magical when its freezing cold outside and youre snuggled under a blanketim glad no other actors were given any of the roles in this film it wouldnt have been the same sandra is adorable as lucy she has no sinister intent shes just swept up in the commotion and in the end falls in love with the whole family her speech toward the end chokes me up so much its completely heartfelt bill pullman also shines he falls for her gradually and their chemistry is so lovely to watch if you want a gentle unbelievably romantic film to watch on a cold evening this is the one for you,happy
lovely little film that has the lonely sandra bullock admiring highclass businessman peter gallagher from afar in her toll booth on the subway then one day he is attacked by a couple of muggers and bullock saves his life by getting him to the hospital naturally gallagher is in a comatose state after the attack a true misunderstanding makes it appear that bullock is gallaghers fiance and typical confusion ensues now gallaghers family all believe that bullock really is his woman gallaghers brother bill pullman is suspicious though but slowly starts to believe bullock as well he then starts to fall in love with her and vice versa a great romantic comedy that is so pure and wellmade that it is near impossible to say anything negative about it it is not a perfect film but it is a very likeable movie that delivers what it promises 4 stars out of 5,happy
 but i am in love with the movieim kicking myself for watching this movie just recently i was quite young when this movie was first released but that is not an excuse for overseeing this movie for so long i am so glad i watched it and im going to keep watching it over and overi am a sucker for romantic comedies and a lot of them are disappointing its very rare to fall in love with a movie and has that effect on me the key to the lucy and jacks romance is chemistry and boy did they have chemistry the element to a great story whether it is reading or watching is to show not tell and thats what exactly what it was the looks that you see jack and lucy give each other their body language the deep conversations they have the way he describes her and how shes head over heels for him the tension they create when put together wasnt anything sexual it was something much much deeper something that will last a lifetime the other key factors to this movie are the callaghans and saul and everyone else they bring out the comedy side to the movie they are a hilarious bunch and are not a tad annoying not even the real fiance or peter just really really funny and fun to be withput two and two together and they have formulated an almost perfect romantic comedy i am going to say almost because nothing in this world is perfectnow bill pullmanthats a different topic,happy
is almost flawless the storyline is funny but at the same time dramatic sandra bullock plays lucy a lonely el worker with no family at all she sees this guy get mugged and pushed on the train tracks and she jumps on and saves his life she follows him to the hospital where it is mistaken that she is the mans fiance she gets thrust into the family who accepts her with open arms however problems arise when she starts to fall in love with the brother of her fiance this movie is perfectly cast with brilliant performances by bullock and bill pullman who plays the brother the have great chemistry and just subtly looks and gestures towards each other during the whole movie add towards the sexual tension between them i have not met anyone who doesnt like this movie and it has become one of my favorites you can watch it a million times and never get tired of it ,happy
next time you are depressed this is the perfect pick me up  if you like watching the same movies over and over this is great for that also  the chemistry between the two main characters is outstanding much better than in this years two weeks notice  laugh out loud and cry out loud,happy
a sweet and gentle romantic film about how love sometimes slips in through the window rather than coming straight in through the front door its the one that put star sandra bullock into contention with meg ryan for the crown of americas sweetheart  and with good reason because in directed by jon turteltaub bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day girl next door in the best and most sincere sense  this is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition the need to love and be loved and makes no bones about what its trying to accomplish along the way  clearly the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time  and they succeed on both frontslucy moderatz bullock lives alone in chicago where she has an apartment a cat and a job with the cta as a token taker for the train  her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful read  dull and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth  shes doesnt even know his name and theyve never exchanged so much as a good morning but in her mind hes become the prince charming shes always dreamed aboutthen on christmas morning he passes through but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks unconscious  and a train is coming  lucy runs to his aid and saves his life but the severe head trauma hes sustained has put him in a coma  at the hospital they refuse to let her in to see him as that is a privilege reserved for family members only so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee which does the trick  but when his family his rather large family shows up her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that lucy simply cant get in a word of explanation  the next thing she knows to the family she is their beloved peters peter gallagher intended even though hes never said a word to them about her and because the situation is so frantic and theres such concern about peter besides which its christmas lucy cant bring herself to tell them the truth  so in an instant her life is suddenly changed shes surrounded by family and shes engaged to her prince charming  even if he is wellin a comaturteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of nora ephrons youve got mail the second best romantic comedy ever made and sleepless in seattle  he sets a perfect pace and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way he makes you feel at home with them  most importantly though turteltaub manages to make this a sweet film without being saccharin about it which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow  instead he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely ephronesque and entertaining and it works beautifully  the humor is warm and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of need that is universal then triumphs by satisfying that need in the endsandra bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here theres a special quality about her lucy that makes you want to reach out to her  she is without question the most vulnerable character bullock has ever played  there is very little of annie speed or gracie miss congeniality for example about her the closest to lucy of any of her characters in fact would be birdee in hope floats  that is not to say there is anything weak about lucy at all quite the contrary in fact there is a decided strength in the very benevolence of lucys nature even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs  this is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life but keeps an open mind and above all an open heart  and that is what makes lucy so endearing shes the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her coworkers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better  thats what bullock brings to her performance here and its what makes lucy one of her most enduring and memorable charactersas for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door thats exactly what bill pullman does with his portrayal of peters brother jack callaghan  hes the one who shows up after the fact as it were but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience  initially jack seems to be playing the role of devils advocate his suspicions aroused by the fact that peter has never mentioned lucy to him but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective  and pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time which makes jack convincing and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly  a character actor type leading man pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters but jack is his most engaging role ever and he succeeds entirely with itthe wonderful supporting cast includes jack warden saul peter boyle ox micole mercurio midge michael rispoli joey and the wonderful glynis johns as beautiful and charming as ever as elsie  warm and poignant is one to savor this ones a keeper  btw the 1 romantic comedy  bonnie hunts return to me  1010,happy
this was the picture which proved things could be all about sandra bullock speed  one year earlier  showed this this picture proved it a lot of people nowadays make fun of a typical bullock picture and speak of her as negligible in this day and age they probably forget or were never aware that she was hailed as americas new sweetheart back in 95 and it was no idle chatter there are very few actresses who can carry a picture on their own slight shoulders  i mean really make it a success sure bill pullman helped but this really was sandra all the way in a sappy soapy clichridden slight story of sudden romance usually very hard to buy into but because sandra is there on the screen throughout nearly every frame it all works out and youre rooting for her happiness in the final few minutes even knowing very well what is about to happen its like youve seen it all before but sandra makes you want to see it again we are all very fortunate those of us who have seen this story that it was sandra in the central role and not someone like shudder demi moore and if a guy is really fortunate he may meet someone like sandra in real life,happy
sandra bullock is a working girl who wants to travel she has no family and is usually stuck doing holiday shifts in the chicago transit system as a toll booth clerk on the elevated railway she has noted one man who uses the station all the time peter gallagher and rescues him when he is thrown onto the train tracks just before a train comes into the station gallagher is in a coma and due to a wellintentioned nurse bullock is introduced to the family of gallagher as his fianc she tries to tell them the truth but when she learns his grandmother glynis johns has a heart problem she hesitates soon she is treated as a member of this nice family as a member well she did save gallagher and she is thought to be his fianc only his brother bill pullman has real doubts and keeps mentioning them and keeps apologizing for them bullock and pullman find that they are also growing more attracted to each other the film shows how these problems are resolved and it is all done in a most charming mannerthis is one of those films that would take only a few minutes to quickly resolve in the real world where bullock would have told the truth early on but the audience is allowed to suspend its disbelief because the characters are uniformly likable although jack pullman is constantly questioning bullocks story each time she gives a plausible explanation of what is going on and pullman likes her enough to accept these explanations the only one who knows the truth is the family friend sam jack warden and he too feels that the news has to be broken carefully he loves the family and doesnt want them hurt oddly enough his one effort at meddling almost screws up the situation in the film for bullock pullman and gallagher pullman also faces the truth and explains to his father peter boyle that he doesnt want to continue in the family business boyles reaction becomes important toothe performances are flawless and one finds oneself rooting for most of the cast the sole exception is the actress playing ashley peter galaghers actual girl friend her opposite number joe jr is too comic a figure to dislike in fact at one point he thinks pullman is annoying bullock and offers to take care of him  not the act of a rat at all for a sweet lovable love tale is hard to top in the last decade only when harry met sally working girl pretty woman notting hill sleepless in seattle and youve got mail are on par with it but the family becomes so important to bullock in the plot this has a special warmth in it that is quite is different from most of the others,happy
after a lonely woman saves the life of a complete stranger shes mistaken for his fianc and slowly becomes integrated into his family due to his coma as her true identity couldnt be verified by anybody everything seems to be well until his brother shows up whose character is about to play a very important role in the upcoming eventsits a lovely and romantic comedy set in the heart of the winter holidays which tells an improbable love story about two complete strangers who fall in love without their will and as much as they try to resist as close they eventually become it creates a warm and enjoyable atmosphere which lasts until the end the actors play their roles very convincingly making you care about their characters while keeping you eager to find out what will happen next and how its going to end besides all of the above it also manages to make you laugh from time to time even out loud just to spice things up a bit its a very good movie for everyone to enjoy especially around the holidays but not only,happy
warm and gentle comedy that shows bullock to her best advantage in her favorite role of shy closet beauty bullock obsesses about a man she sees briefly every day when he is knocked unconscious she claims to be his fiance then sparks begin to fly with the brother wonderful turns by boyle and warden as older family members theres a great line by boyle in this movie something like you always imagine youll have these long golden moments in life and then when you get there it lasts about a minute i think bullock was never better than in this movie in later productions her shy modesty seems a little artificial she and pullman have just enough chemistry together to pull this through,happy
its a screwball romantic comedy worthy of all of the heritage of the genrehaving said that its also a pleasant antidote to war porn masquerading as high art and to actual porn because its a wonderful reflection on the importance of kindness in the worldsandra bullock is delightful natch bill pullman is enchanting and peter gallagher is engaging as a man in a comawatch this is you just want to find a speck of decency in a scary world,happy
i know i knowyou saw the name bill pullman and wanted to shove this movie a side too in this movie though he is absolutely a sweetheart this wonderful fairytale really got me sandra bullock bill pullman and his entire kooky family sucked me right in this movie is such a chick flick but it is really funny too joe fusco jr see it i think youll love it i did,happy
this was an extremely underrated movie there were so many funny little segments and happenings in this movie like when the newspaper boy was delivering papers and when they had the dinner conversation if you just watch the movie for some good laughs and dont try to expect some big deep storyline you will find that it is a very enjoyable movie it had us all laughing till wewell you know what i mean sit back get some popcorn and enjoy the show theres nothing wrong with silly senseless humor is there even my husband enjoyed it ive seen this movie more times than i probably should admit but i laugh every time i see it another good choicehow to meet a guy in 10 days,happy
this is one of those movies that just make you feel good its not deep but its warm it should be a holiday classicnew age era,happy
in my opinion is a sweet charming hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy if you ask me the way that lucy sandra bullock and peter peter gallagher met was very romantic also in my opinion joey michael rispoli was a little crazy this was because he just couldnt seem to leave lucy alone in addition to me jack bill pullman was a really cute guy before i wrap this up id like to say if you like romantic comedies or movies where people meet by chance i highly recommend now in conclusion when you see this sweet charming hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy prepare to laugh and be touched,happy

no matter how many times i watch this movie i cant get enough of it whenever ive had a bad day or am not in a good mood all i have to do is watch this fabulous amazing movie makes you believe in fate and following your dreams if you never watch another movie in your life watch this one you wont regret it,happy
i loved this movie quite a lot ive seen it a few times and it is one of my favourite romcoms as a guy im not usually attracted to romcoms but this was a great exception sandra bullock is lovely in this movie and her relationships with other characters is really well portrayed a must watch also its from the 90s and the scenes are idyllic,happy
i love this movie  if youve ever wondered why comedies made in the 1930s or 1940s were far better than anything in more recent decades  it was really the writing well this film is written as well or better than any comedy in the last half century  the overall plot is wonderful  the actors perfectly chosen  and all the small steps each character makes are entirely believable consistent revelatory of character and gently leading  inevitably  to what a resolution viewer wants to seethis will stay in your mind  youll want to see it over and over  youll want to tell your friends  youll want a sequel and a prequel youll want to remember each line of dialogue to replay scenes to make sure you have the quotations you tell your friends exactly right  seldom mentioned in these reviews is also the beauty and feel for chicago its underplayed  but there throughout  the els lake michigan the chicago river the bridges and the skyscrapers and the lovely houses in the residential neighborhoods nothing is said about them  theyre the background  but so well chosen i would love to see a sequel  now 23 years after the film was made bullock and pullman as a middleaged married couple  peter gallaghers continued quest for the perfect woman the sister mary  and the reminiscence of the passing of the previous generation  of boyle and warden glynis johns and the others the strange thing is that the two brilliant writers of this film seem hardly to have written any other film before or since is it possible they used pseudonyms for this one i would beg them to write a sequel for these characters dont doubt my review  this will become for you a beloved movie youll never forget,happy
im 16 years old and many years ago my mum introduced me to a movie where it was made in a golden decade where almost all romantic comedies ive seen are treasured this movie i watch every year at least 10 times maybe more maybe less it is by far my favourite and i love watching it around christmas time since the movie is around the christmasnew year season so if youre going to watch this movie watch it around christmas time novemberdecember should do i watched it just now and its october but still its a great movie anytime of the year it will make you laugh cry and sigh as you see her life and the magical events that happen evolve into a beautiful heartwarming story if you are an ol romantic and enjoy innocent humour then this is the movie for you its just amazing im so glad my mum introduced me to it i cant wait to have a family and introduce them thats how good it is ,happy
this movie has it all  comedy romance even a good touch of drama the characters are vibrantly real the situations believable and the plotline both humorous and plausible sandra bullock is dynamite and bill pullman is at his hottest mrrawr i highly recommend this for any fan of romantic comedies at any time of the yearthanks tsfpwde,happy
sandra bullock has redeemed herself in my eyes i watched part of the net in a theater but walked out in disgust she is much more appealing in this film which i have watched repeatedlythe plot is somewhat thin underfoot but the cast overcomes this with some of the greatest efforts i have ever seen sandra is luminous as lucy moderatz a woman who has suffered a great deal of loss in her life and seems doomed to a lonely life alone lucy eases her heartache by dreaming about wedding the handsome man who buys a token at her booth every weekday morningwhen an improbable collection of circumstances result in lucy being accepted as the fiance of her dream man who is in a coma and in no condition to refute her claim she gains the warm loving family she has so long desired lucy makes such an instantly positive impression on the family of her supposed fiance they are delighted to make her part of the family when her fiancee wakes from his coma and fails to recognize lucy the family covers the gap by presuming amnesia rather than suspecting some subterfuge on the part of lucyi enjoyed many parts of this film the best part was where the family gathered to exchange christmas presents lucy had her name on a stocking and a present from santa the look on lucys face as she savored these moments was priceless the next morning lucy meets jack her fiancees brother and sparks immediately flythis film really illustrated how deprived lucy has been when she needs personal advice she has to rely on her boss at work basically her fellow workers and her wouldbe boyfriend at her apartment complex are her only human contact it would seem logical that lucy would join a church or find some other social outletall the supporting cast is great here the performers fit into their roles perfectly bill pullman and sandra bullock really bring their characters to life you find yourself rooting for the inevitable victory of true love over circumstancesthis is movie entertains without the need to appeal to the baser instincts it was grand to see an intact functional family for once we need more efforts like this to show that a great movie can be made using wholesome themes,happy
this is one of those movies where she waits for me to get emotional but i had steel resolve holding back any tears or emotion sandy bullock you wont break me you wont,happy
this is a very sweet movie really theres not much not to like here its also one of those rare films that gives formula a good name as its about as predictable a romantic comedy as it gets but also well made with a great cast and just so darn likablesandra bullock is lucy a lonely subway cashier who finds herself admiring highclass businessman peter gallagher from her turnstile secretly in love with him she is forced to come to his aid one morning right before christmas after he is mugged and then pushed onto the train platformlater in hospital through a series of romantic comedy misunderstandings lucy is mistaken for peters fiance and while he lies in a coma his loud rather dysfunctional family take her into their foldto complicate matters lucy finds herself drawn to the patients brother bill pullman and the lovely uncle saul jack warden may have just learned her secretalthough the ending is a bit weak this is a totally enjoyable movie on just about every level special mention to michael rispoli as lucys neighbour joe jr who is scene stealing hilarious and also randomly that bit with the paperboy wiping out on his bike really made me laugh i smile now just thinking about it32716,happy
was i shocked to read from the trvia section on this webpage that this movie was originally written for demi moore  of all the actresses in the world demi moore  she shed her innocence  sweetness when she made movies like one night stand is it the correct title with rob lowe  its like seeing rosanne barrarnold as lucy in this filmgreat comical timing between sandra  bill  the scene where they walk back to lucys apartment is especially brightens your day  of course who can forget the whole callaghan clan  its rare to see such a closeknitted family in us anymore  its heartwarming  touching  sweet  lovely  just terrificthis movie reminds me not to fall in love with a person just because of the looks  lucy was ready to marry peter but didnt know that he was so selfobsessive all his pictures in his wallet  home and who would hurt squirrels  save them  im on jacks side when i say yewo  look at the soft spoken sweet jack who puts family first remember his rocking chair  is more downtoearthagreeing with the rest of the audience here who had posted their comments this is the movie to see when youre feeling a little blue a little lonely or just want to get out of reality for a few hourswell ill be waiting for my jack callaghan now  wish you all enjoy the movie experience,happy
its a shame that this movie has such a low rating at imdb because it deserves betteris the kind of film that must be hard to pull off because there arent many of them solid wellwritten and consistently funny romantic comediessandra bullock exudes buckets of charm and a whopper of a comic presence as the heroine of this particular romance she ably carries the movie even when surrounded by veterans like jack warden peter boyle and glynis johnsthose who are familiar with chicago will have fun with this film as thats where it was filmed and you could make a game out of spotting the inconsistencies in the movie if you actually know the city its set ina fun movie to pop in here and there during the holiday seasongrade a,happy
this is a great movie to watch when youre feeling low  its fun to watch lucy and jack slowly fall for each other while trying to do the right thing by poor peter the comatose fiance  ill just add that if youre looking for a movie to watch with your mom and dad this is it  no embarrassing sex scenes or unnecessary vulgar language and it still manages to be a great time at the movies  now fancy that a clean movie that entertains  restores my faith in moviemakers  ,happy
i watched this for about the 5th time last night and would challenge anyone not to warm to the characters in this movie bullock and pulman are perfect as indeed are the rest of the cast if i had any criticism it would be that the pace slows slightly and it may be a fraction long but this is a minor flaw in what is a true feel good movie,happy
ive watched many romantic comedies but this film definitely takes the cake i fell in love with the movie the first time i saw it and i still never get tired of watching it my favorite part of the movie was definitely the callaghans they still keep me laughing in all the same spots each time i watch it i also love the story bw lucy and jack bc its more realistic than most i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasnt seen it,happy
saw this film for the seventh or eighth or ninth time yesterday sigh certainly one of the best films in the genre sandra bullock looks the part and plays it with all her endearing charms possibly one of her better performances to date bill pullman acted with all the appropriately confused gestures of a man in love but feels that he shouldnt be,happy
is one of the best situational comedies of modern cinema that is of the last decade of the 20th century and well into the 21st its also a very good comedy romance since her debut in 1987 sandra bullock had been in over a dozen films but this was the first role for which she received critical notice she was nominated for a best actress golden globe for her performance as lucy moderatzthe plot for this comedy romance is refreshingly different very interesting and ripe for lots of humor this isnt a sidesplitting comedy but one of warmly funny situations the romance is the slowly developing type that evolves into a nice love story its a wholesome story that isnt ruined by the alltoofrequent gratuitous sex that hollywood wants to promote as the norm and that gives this film a tinge of honestybelieve it or not there are many relationships between couples that develop without their jumping into bed yes even well into the 21st century the writers got a little dig in here to that effect a coworker of lucys seems amazed that lucy wasnt with her boyfriendthe film treats religious beliefs with some slight humor in a couple of places ox and saul peter boyle and jack warden are nominal in their catholic and jewish faiths respectively and thats an accurate portrayal of many people as wellwith lucy having no other family she takes immediately to the callaghan clan she enjoys all the members who display varying degrees of kindness warmth and wackiness its the family that she never had but misses and this setting is pitched against the glamorous but empty life of the wealthy party people of park avenuethis is a fine film that the whole family should enjoy here are some favorite lines for more dialog see the quotes section under this imdb web page of the moviejerry lucy youre born into a family you do not join them like you do the marineslucy you have to tell me what to do jerry pull the plug lucy youre sick jerry im sick youre cheating on a vegetableelsie new years eve hasnt been the same since guy lombardo diedpeter you know you do remind me of someone its probably youpeter it took a coma to wake me upox were in the estate furniture business we buy furniture from dead peoplejoe jr all right lucy its either me or him lucy him joe jr you dont have to answer right awaylucy who is it joe jr joe junior lucy im not here joe jr i know that tricklucy you know jack ive had a really lousy christmas youve just managed to kill my new years if you come back on easter you can burn down my apartmentorderly excuse me got some jello for you today peter do i like jello midge yum ox mmmox your mothers got me eating these fatfree muffins they taste like plywood,happy
peter boylemicole mercurio jason bernard and jack warden they have all left us and while im sure they have done bigger things i am so grateful that they leave this great movie behind so we can enjoy them together in such a heart warming movie every person in this movie is just so lovable and endearing granted theres nothing here to be taken seriously but thats okay its sappy hallmarky only slightly plausible and highly unlikely that everything would align so comically in real life but its a quirky comfy warm and fuzzy escape for just under two hours with a family you will fall in love with and i wouldnt have replaced a single actor anywhere in it,happy
almost all of my favorite comedies were made in the 1930s or 1940s but i adore this one some of the striking things how well the plot continues to work after peter gallaghers character goes through a change the real chemistry between bill pullman and the delightful sandra bullock the wonderful acting by peter gallagher as someone who comes to realize hes really not had a good character in his life so far hes charming while also discovering this dismaying truthmost of all its the modesty and naturalness of sandra bullock  as a poor lonely still missing her late father terribly sweet yet never coy completely lovable utterly sympathetic we are with her in every frame we want her to gain everything her heart desires  and we really like bill pullman tooit seems to me that any romantic comedy rests largely on how likable the characters are  we must completely sympathize with them feel with them  they can have difficulty deciding between lovecareer or lovelocation or between two people  but we cant have difficulty deciding whether we yearn for them to be happyin some respects sandra bullock does seem a throwback  i could easily imagine this movie taking place during the depression  though it would be a role reversal in screwball comedies  which this really isnt  the woman are wealthy and the men are poortheres an innate decency in the character played by sandra bullock  in that respect it reminds me of the somewhat more genteel characters played by irene dunne in comedies like the awful truth or my favorite wife or penny serenade  you are watching a genuinely kind and thoughtful person when you see the characters  and it draws you in its why i find it hard to imagine that demi moore was originally slotted to play this character  she has a toughness of heart that i cannot imagine for this characterthis movie was written so well that i looked to see what else the screenwriters had done  nothing is listed you cant go wrong with this movie  one of the top several movie comedies in the last half century,happy
1995 12 sandra bullock bill pullman peter gallagher peter boyle jack warden michael rispoli glynis johns nicole mercurio monica keena wonderful romantic comedy of mistaken identity and a lovely homage to screwball comedy with the winsome and sexy bullock in a starmaking role as a lonely subway token collector whose crush on a handsome commuter gallagher causes her to rescue him from a mugging but when he falls into a coma is assumed by his family to be the fiancee they never met pullman finally breaks out of the typecast of nice guywholosesthegirl niche and this time his goodhumored charm shines through as he falls for bullockfunny freespirited and goodhearted,happy
until i saw i had no great opinion of sandra bullockor really felt one way or the other about her but seeing the movie and falling under its spell i realized what a fine comedienne she is the mistaken identity theme has served many a romantic comedy well and this film is no exception but it isnt until sandra meets bill pullman that the film really begins to click the chemistry between them is undeniable and gives the film the lift it really needs to soar a charming harmless piece of fluff that almost seems out of place amid the harsh realities of the 90sits more like a throwback to the kind of comedies carole lombard did so well the wintry landscapes of chicago provide a perfect background for the story of a token booth clerk who falls for a handsome rich guy its all done with a light touch and again its the teaming of sandra and bill that makes the slight tale really work a real charmer with a romantic glow,happy
its been a while since ive written a review on this sitebut after seeing miss bullock in this filmi felt a need to do soi do believe ive seen her in every film shes ever been inand at my age82in 2 weeksi may have 4gotten if thats true or notbut it matters notfor she is needed to be seennot only for acting abilitybut for her beauty as wellthere is no doubt that her looks but heras far as im concerned with another beautiful actresswho else but liz tayloryeahyou heard methis particular filmalso happens to be a great movieits what true love is really aboutfilms of this venueusually dont reach that pinnacleal ziemer an old friendhas given me permission to see it again love you guys,happy
this movie is touching and heartwarmingit shows you the importance of family in lifethere are some moments when you laugh and others when all you can do is say awwww sandra bullock is superb as usualshe makes the character so lovablethe people that play the family are great too well worth seeing,happy
its a mustwatch movie for all romantics its simple wholesome storyline uplifts ones spirits and leaves you feeling all nice and warm inside the chemistry between pullman and bullock is magic its nice to see oldfashioned romance come to life in the interactions between the 2 lead roles the scenes where they appear together are touchingly sweet especially when they were caught under the mistletoe the supporting casts are strong and often very funny the dialogues and scenes with some of them are sure to bring a smile to your face though the ending is predictable it did have a small twist when pullmans as jack family went with him to propose to bullock as lucy or maybe not as its obvious from the beginning that having a family meant a lot to lucy this is one movie where you can watch and rewatch without feeling bored,happy
while you where is a beautiful movie about lucy who has no family and secretly has a crush on peter peter a business man whos always in a hurry flies by her kiosk and hardly ever says a word to her one day she saves him from the tracks and after a couple of misunderstandings she becomes peters future wife but she meets peters brother a handsome bloke who loves her the moment he sees her next is a story with great humor and great acting of sandra and bill peterwhos most of the movie has some very nice lines which made me laugh out loud  abcdefg he tries to find out whether he lost his memory or not thats one line that popped into my head when you look at this film you feel the love that is growing between sandra and bills characters their charisma is sparkling together and also you meet a great family who instantly accepts lucy into their family no questions asked more people should see this movie you great afterwords if i had been  i would have missed this beautiful movie im glad i didnt,happy
i am not really a fan of romantic comedies i tend to find them lame most of the time however this one is not bad theres something about this one that sets it apart from others of its genre it isnt boring lame or mushy stuff this one is original fresh funny and romantic plus it takes place at christmas time actually it captures the christmas spirit and it shows us houses full of lovely christmas decorations and lightsthis movie is naturally more recommendable for those who like sugary stories or romantic stories and even for those who still believe in love yet it is a reasonable choice for those who are unhappy in love or bitter about itthe soundtrack is quite good one of the movies best songs is natalie coles oldie this will be an everlasting love the opening credits combine expressive and beautiful sights of chicago with natalie coles old classicthe actors are generally good and portray generally likable characters sandra bullock and bill pullman form a perfect couple and their chemistry is faultless the rest of the cast is not bad too jack warden peter boyle jason bernard hes hilarious in this movie and glynis johns best known as mrs banks from mary poppins the role of lucy eleanor moderatz was originally for demi moore but im glad that it went for the beautiful sandra bullock instead sandy is perfect for this role i dont see demi in this rolethere are many funny moments during the movie including a hilarious one with a newspapers boy falling off his bike then again the movie is in general fun and amusing aside some humor of discussable taste,happy
sandra bullock bill pullman and peter gallagher star in this 1995 romantic comedy a woman unwittingly pretends to be engaged to a man who ends up in a coma lucy bullock is a train token collector who longs for romance one day she saves a man peter gallagher who ends up in a coma at the hospital a nurse mistakenly hears lucy say she was going to marry him soon lucy meets peters family and brother jack she and jack start falling for each other and lucy tries to tell the family the truth but cant when peter wakes up he cant remember anything and meets lucy learning shes his fiance lucy tries to go through with the wedding but reveals the truth to the family and soon ends up with jack the late greats peter boyle and jack warden costar in this as ox and saul this is a good film i think its one of sandras best and she  bill have great chemistry i recommend this,happy
as always sandra bullock was perfect playing a lonely ticket office employee who falls for a regular passenger whilst he never notices her she saves his life after hes attacked by muggers chance continues by allowing her to get to know his family as they believe shes his fianc and they all love and welcome her into their family she tries a number of times to tell them the truth but at the same time shes so lonely after the death of her father that she longs to stay with this family and marry this man she loves whos all this time in a coma but then she falls for his brother whilst the brother seems quite hostile to her a friend of the family whos guessed the truth promises to tell the family the truth but unfortunately he decides to meddle and instead persuades the accident victim when hes out of his coma to ask his saviour to marry him  the very last thing she wants now shes keen on his brother the brother attracted but completely confused avoids the girl so she accepts the proposal how this resolves itself id better not sayi felt the script was rather weak at times  the fencing between bullock and the confused attracted brother convinced this girl is a sponger could have been better and the actor is not id say entirely right for the part however its still a delightful movie and i cant see anyone not enjoying it,happy
this is an entertaining feelgood romantic comedy featuring a wonderful cast that work together to perfection sandra bullock does this kind of movie as well as anyone and she has bill pullman peter boyle jack warden and others along for the sillinessthe plot has a wild premise but this great cast makes it work the story navigates through constant misunderstandings between characters driving the plot forward with more and more chaos ensuing as the movie progresses bullock and pullman as the lead characters lucy and jack have both comedic and romantic chemistry everybody in the supporting cast is delightful in their roles as well two of the most hilarious characters are lucys neighbor and jacks greatauntlike any romantic comedy sentimental moments are interspersed with the craziness my personal favorite is when lucy joins the callaghan family for christmas the closeups of her while christmas music plays in the background along with the familys banter is endearingits a great popcorn movie and a great date movie highly recommended for those who like romantic comedy and for sandra bullock fans,happy
since i was born in arlington virginia like sandra bullock i have been a fan and it happens i have a sister named sandra too i find her role in this movie simply delightful and very very well done the vulnerability she displays in her character is played with poignancy and artistic sensitivity sandy shows me that her acting talent has a range that others might not see since she is very pretty it is sometimes difficult to convince audiences that you have real raw acting talent i believe she displays her capabilities admirably in this role bill pullman is also a great complement to her character he blends his character into a caring smitten masculine sensitive human being one does not see this type of character developed by others in similar roles he has accomplished it marvelously his role is a real tribute to bills versatility as a character actor the direction and script make this movie charming without overdoing and with real people that you feel totally connected with from the start and yes i believe the chemistry between sandy and bill is just as electrifying as meg ryan and tom hanks in their romantic comedies,happy
is the best romantic comedy ever made it is sweet hystrical charming and isnt confusing lucysandra bullock is a toll both collecter at the local subway every morning she sits there like a beal she becomes fascinated with a man he then is pushed onto the tracks worried lucy ones to get him so that he doesnt get run over but he will not wake up so she decides to roll with it he is brought to the hospital where is diagnosed in a coma like state one of the nurses overhears her saying how she was going to marry him thats when the trouble starts from then on it is a downward spiral of events form meeting the parents to becoming a part of their family to telling all of them the truth in the end sandra bullock is at her best in this role i love this movie,happy
this is one of my favourite feel good movies i congratulate the writers on producing a comedyromance story that doesnt rely on the gratious need for sex violence or  continuous swearing it is just a really nice movie and i recommend this for anyone feeling a little low and in need of a pick me up,happy
they dont make movies like this anymore just a wonderful simple love story each time i see this flick i fall in love with it all over again no other movie has ever made me laugh cry and cheer sometimes simultaneouslythe bulk of this movie is set during the holiday season in my book it should be played every year without fail during that time of year its that specialis still number one on my list if you havent seen it and like a sweet simple wonderful love story with lots of smiles and some tears give it a shot you wont be disappointed,happy
this is my favorite movie of all time  i loved everything about it  the comedy the romance the romanticcomedy aspect   i can never say enough great things about this movie  the chemistry between bill pullman  sandra bullock was the best  just that alone made this worth seeingi have it on vhs now i just need to add it to my dvd collectionsmiling,happy
sandra bullock stars in what must be the perfect winter holiday movie of our time with some great laughs and an adorable storyline sandra and bill pullman pull off one heck of a combined performance i was also in tears near the end when it got more emotional and the gf was getting a little misty as well great movie thats all i can say i would without hesitation recommend this film to anyone,happy
1995 dir jon turteltaub  cast sandra bullock bill pullman peter gallagher jack warden michael rispoli wonderful treasure suggesting the happenings one doesnt realize sandra bullock plays lucy who works at a subway where she looks forward to the appearance of one guy after he is pushed on railway tracks by muggers she rushes to his aid and saves him from certain death due to a misunderstanding his family believes her to be his fianc she wishes to tell them the truth but complications arise especially when she falls for the victims brother predictable but warm hearted with grand humour it isnt littered with lame cheap sex scenes but rather it concentrates on the relationships directed by jon turteltaub in what appears to be a homage to the classic audrey hepburn films bullock is endearing in her dilemma bill pullman is charming in his retrain peter gallagher is hilarious as the coma victim who awakens to a life he doesnt recall jack warden plays the family godfather who knows lucys secret but his attempts to set things straight are often botched finally michael rispoli adds a great degree of hysterics her landlords son a slob with good intentions a beautiful portrait of family that gives the indication that through the likes of fair game turteltaub was busy with a film that is worth staying awake for score 9  10,happy
a ticketcollecting romantic sandra bullock pretends to be engaged to an unconscious man peter gallagher but cannot fool his brother bill pullmanromantic comedies are judged pretty harshly and they probably should be as they are generally sentimental unrealistic fluff but this is one of those rare good ones is it sentimental yes unrealistic yes fluff yes but it really cemented sandra bullock as americas sweetheart and may be her finest role well this and speed she is going as strong as ever twenty years later and it should be no surprisepeter gallagher is a bit off but bill pullman really succeeds as a romantic interest odd but he does it and the supporting cast is excellent from peter boyle to well everyone,happy
jon turteltaub directed this sweet romantic comedy that stars sandra bullock as a beautiful but lonely subway worker named lucy who is smitten with a handsome stranger named peterplayed by peter gallagher one day to her amazement he is mugged and knocked unconscious on the rails and she saves his life but he is in a coma at the hospital when she meets his familyplayed by peter boyle jack warden and glynis johns she blurts out that she is his fiance and so begins a romantic comedy of errors though his brother jackplayed by bill pullman isnt convinced even as he and lucy find themselves falling in love modernday classic comedy is both very funny and charming with a wonderful cast and smart screenplay bullock is radiant throughout and ends exactly as viewer was hoping,happy
bring this for a womens day showing and still funny laughable and watchablea classic sandra bullock movie,happy
the irony in my summary line above is that lucy sandra bullock was the one to find peter peter gallagher and not the other way around and then as things progress she winds up finding peters brother in a film filled with clever second guessing and imponderable coincidences the cleverest was the one testicle scenario i wondered how the script was going to pull off that little conundrum and the screenwriters did it with style so heres a romantic comedy that works without getting sappy sandra bullock and bill pullman affect a low key chemistry in the story that allows them to ride out the controversy of a phony engagement made all too real through a series of misjudgments you really have to give the screenwriters credit here for making a believable story out of a set of unbelievable circumstances the only thing that might not work here is the idea that someone who looks like sandra bullock wouldnt have eligible guys lined all the way up and down the block from her eltrain cubicle to ask her out on a date that aside the story comes together in a charming way to make this not only an engaging chick flick but an entertaining family film as well,happy
lets make it clear this is a pure romcom but a cleaver funny and not too sweet one i watched it by accident and because i like sandra bullock it is really nice well written and with great supporting actors the main character bullock works in public transport has no family and is secretly in love with one the customers she sees daily at work when she saves his life after he fell on the track one day she goes to the hospital to get some news she gets to meet the family which has some hilarious characters and kind of gets adopted by them while her love interest is in the coma while he was nothing philosophical it just makes you feel good and that is already a lot,happy
who told i remember when i was still with my ex wife we would watch this movie together thousands of times i loved her as i had no other woman before her the obvious love between jack  lucy was the way we were you can see it when they were standing together at the top of the steps outside of her apartment again when they do the slip and slid routine on the ice and again when they area moving that ugly sofa into peters apartment sol was a gerat sidenote in this comedy between him and joe jr they keep the comedy flowing the right way i didnt like peters character even before he woke up peter was everything we werent him with his perfect apartment and loving himself with all those pictures how could he have room for anyone else family meant everything to my ex her family was just the opposite of jack  peters i just wish that my ex could realize all she gave up for her dogs does anyone have some dead peoples furniture for sale this movie was great and still is 10 years later this movie is a must have for all of us sensitive idiots i thought guys dont cry,happy
sandra bullock play lucy a sweet girl who has recently lost her father and never knew her mother she works taking tokens at a commuter train station she sees the same guy peter gallagher who plays peter everyday and fantasizes that he will one day notice her and they will fall in loveand happily ever after will happenone day she sees him pushed onto the tracks by a couple of hoods he is knocked unconscious lucy jumps on the tracks and saves his life from there he is transported  still unconscious to the hospital and lucy meets his family and they know she saved his life and they think she is peters girlfriend the gallagher family fall in love with lucy and she loves the familypeter boyle does a good job as the father and jack warden is also great as the family friend saulis worth watching it is just so sweet and light hearted you cant help but love it,happy
this is my favorite movie ever i can see it over and over and i still laugh my ass off the table scene where they have 10 conversations about one thing going on is just hilarious the parents are sweet and yet they are just insanely funny it also has a great love story and family storyline watching this movie warms my heart i know im just a wimp but i cried when bill pullman gave sandra bullock the snowglobe the landlords son is great too i love the leaning story there are so many things in this movie that we used in our conversations for years after seeing it these mashed potatoes are so creamy i dont drink any less either,happy
anytime i feel alone i watch this movie and feel like i am not the only one who feels that way this movie is pure and simple no sex or complicated scheming charactersthis is a movie i can watch with my kids or my parents in the room you cant say that for most movies these days i think bill pullman and sandra bullock should do another movie together as they have a lot of on screen chemistryanytime i feel alone i watch this movie and feel like i am not the only one who feels that way this movie is pure and simple no sex or complicated scheming charactersthis is a movie i can watch with my kids or my parents in the room you cant say that for most movies these days,happy
bullock plays lucy a lonely chicago transit worker  she falls in love with a man shes never talked to peter peter gallagher but sees every day at the train station  one day she saves his life but he slips into a coma his family mistakenly believes shes his girlfriend and she doesnt have the heart to correct them  then she meets peters sweet softspoken brother jack a wonderful bill pullman and falls for him  then peter wakes up you can figure out the rest  utterly predictable but totally charming  the script is funny the film looks gorgeous and bullock and pullman have wonderful chemistry together  well worth seeinga perfect date film  one small complaintit goes on a bit too long  still well worth seeing,happy
i am not fond of movies where the entire plot is dependent on a silly misunderstanding  this is the case here when lucy sandra bullock saves the life of a man she has a crush on and is mistakenly thought to be his fiance by his family  not of the family is convinced that she is who she says she is especially jack bill pullman who has designs on lucy for himself through some funny dramatic and painful moments it all has a happy endingdont dwell too much on anything going on or question it  it will ruin whatever enjoyment this movie holds  concentrate on the comedic turns by glynis johns michael rispoli and ally walker  bullock is adequate to the movie and is believable in her big monologue when she explains why she did not come clean with the family the character played by peter gallagher who is in a coma for at least 34 of the movie is the least appealing  he has pictures of himself in his wallet and in his apartment  what kind of guy does that unless hes completely selfinvolved  dont worry lucy ends up with the other guy,happy
lucy moderatz works in the toll booth on chicagos transit system she lives alone and has no family in the area so is always the one to get dumped with the holiday shifts lonely she has fashioned a fantasy around a man who gets the train at around 0800 each day on christmas day she sees this man being mugged and falling onto the tracks she manages to save him from an oncoming train even though he falls into a coma a mistake at the hospital sees a nurse telling the mans family that lucy is peters fianc and before she can deny it she is taken to the bosom of his rather tumultuous family unable to tell them the truth and rather taken by this sudden sense of belonging to a group lucy plays along but the arrival of peters brother jack sees her story being doubtedwhen aliens come to earth and demand to know what sandra bullock is for this should be one of the films that you sit them down in front of because she pretty much makes it this is not as easy as it sounds because on paper this is a ludicrously silly setup that could have been as cloying and sentimental as one fears these things can be however the film somehow manages to deliver it with a bluecollar homely charm the light comic air helps because it gets under your skin by not appearing to take itself too seriously but then managing to weasel a story in there amongst the sweetness this is not to say that it is a brilliant film of course but by general standards it most certainly is not it is though a good genre film that will please those that go in for rather sweet romcoms those that dont should avoid but those inbetween may find they that it amuses themturteltaubs direction of his actors is good and visually everything feels rather warm and safe even the mugging is rather suburban and sanitised which does suit the material i didnt like the overuse of the kooky incidental music which seemed at times to be everywhere i knew what i was watching i didnt need it musically rammed down my throat im not sure how she will be remembered but on her day few can do romantic comedy like sandra bullock if you dont like her you dont like her i guess but she does have good looks wrapped up in a sort of sweet girlnextdoor sort of thing and it is this that carries her in this film she is vulnerable when she needs to be and mostly she is bang on with her performance she works well with the rest of the cast and even manages to make the absurd relationship with pullman work he is not quite at her level but they have a good chemistry together that he works well the support cast help create this rather comic world that makes the plot float better and features unspectacular if entertaining turns from boyle warden johns and others gallagher is the focus and does his job well even if he has the thankless task of lying around for most of itoverall then an enjoyable if silly romantic comedy it works because it mostly avoids laying on the sentiment in a syrupy way it has a consistently comic air and it features mostly charming performances led by the very downtoearth and charming bullock,happy
12 though it may be predictable this extremely entertaining romancecomedy snatches a subtle heartfelt performance from sandra bullock a strong supporting cast providing comic relief and a sharp directorial by jon turteltaub after coma victim peter gallagher gets rescued by good samaritan bullock following an accident at the subway station his offbeat family mistakingly believe that bullock is his fiance only shes falling for someone else granted things do turn out as foreseen the shining ensemble of actors demonstrate that plot predictability cant restrain this film from exceeding the mediocre standard its funny sincere and heartwarming,happy
this movie is for lovers of good old fashioned romantic comedies ive seen this movie twenty times so i obviously love it generally i save it for rainy sunday afternoons sandra bullock is at her most adorable and there are some scenes where you just want to jump into the screen and hug her the support cast is great dont you hate it when some small role is so badly acted that you loose your thread in the movie and the plot is simple if predictable as it should be in a romantic comedy what i love about this film is that it doesnt clog up the plot with unfaithfulness and over the top gross hummer its all nice and sweet and simple and you just want the girl to get the guy good forget your worries pulp,happy
this movie was a very good one and i love it very much because it has great humor and the romance makes you giddy sandra bullock and bill pullman are the perfect leads to the movie sandra has the gullible sweetness that everyone could fall for and bill pullman has the charming lovable features that match perfectly with sandra i also love the heartwarming parts where you can really go into the depths of sandras happiness or loneliness her acting is incredible it gets you crying along with her what i have to say i absolutely love is jacks jealousy for his brother and joe jr no parts are gushy either its perfect to watch,happy
i usually dont fall for romantic comedies but i have seen wyws every year since it came outtwice each christmas in fact  yes ive read pro reviews and i agree the plot is rather predictable some snippets of dialogue clunky but overall this movie gets better with each viewingreasons twosandra and bill both are stunning performers individually and together they are dynamite  without hardly a kiss they share this magnetism hollywood is so hardpressed to create these days  their expressions gestures every moment of screen time is superbi especially love the leaning bit the objections and of course that wrenching scene in lucys apartment also of notejacks illustrious family  elsie the grandma is a riot  they all are my advice buy the movie  you can watch it anytime you like i prefer the holiday season and it never gets old  sweetness wins again,happy
after repeated viewings ive concluded that this movie is to its genre what casablanca is to its genre  although a simple romantic comedy its set against the backdrop of the  human condition loss of a loved one which happens to everybody and shows the triumph of the indomitable human spirit portraying people who not only can but do cope   for instance the opening scenes show a skater falling on the ice  later a newspaper delivery boy falls on the ice  but lucy and jack fall on the ice together and they fall in love  sharing troubles can be a bonding experience,happy
if youve just been dumped had a bad day or not had the phone call from that guy this is the movie to cheer a girl up  not many guys seem to like it much but for a while i watched this nearly every dayunlucky in everything lucy is played to perfection by sandra bullock  to me this is just about her best movie  the actors breath life into the characters to the point you could almost believe they are real  for someone who doesnt like admitting to liking romances this is perfect  it has just the right blend of comedy and romance  peter gallagher even does as much with his character the mostly unconscious brother as possible and the small appearances of ally walker as ashleigh give the movie what it needs to seem believableso forget reality for a couple of hours and watch this movie on a lonely day,happy
i nominate this as the absolute worst film of the year for 1995 or at least the dumbest film of 1995 i remember taking this lady i was trying impress to see this film at the local theater thinking it would be a good date movie since i had heard people were flocking to see it wowboth me and my then girlfriend almost threw up leaving the theater we both agreed this was the most ludicrous stupid and overhyped movie of the year the fact this was a hit movie is a sad comment who can account for taste maybe the public was just desperate for a nice love story even if it made no sense folks this movie made no sense it was the dumbest story i have ever seen on film with the possible exception of the cult movie sorority babes in the slimeball bowloramasandra bullock was a great choice for the female lead however because nobodybutnobody is more of a brainless bimbo on film than miss bullockrole after role add the stupidsounding bill pullman and these two were made for this filmif i explained to you what this was about you might not believe me check the never mind the bullock review elsewhere here on the user comments he explains it wellin over 3000 reviews i have never used the phrase worst movie of the year on any title so take that as a warning if you have not seen this movie save yourself the money,happy
1995 is a romantic comedy about this ticket seller lucy sandra bullock who saves the life of her dream man peter peter gallagherat the hospital a big misunderstanding happens when the mans family thinks shes his fiancenow shes part of the family and living the life shes always wanted to liveshe also begins to have feelings for peters brother jack bill pullmanjon turteltaubs is a very enjoyable romantic comedysandra bullock gives a really sweet performance as lucyyou really start liking this characterand theres some chemistry between sandras character and bill pullmans character jack which makes a big deal in the movies of this genrethe two late great actors peter boyle ox callaghan and jack warden saul bring some more glow into this moviemichael rispoli is funny as the neighbor joey who digs lucythere are also such names as glynis johns elsie jason bernard jerry wallace ally walker ashley and dick cusack drrubinthis is a true feelgood moviei saw it on the last day of 2007 and i felt good until the clock hit twelve and the year was all new,happy
this is what id call a real christmas movie sandra bullock at her best and she can do best and bill pullman looking particularly handsome im fed up with films that are dirty contain swear words for no reason at all and try to make statements using shock tactics this on the other hand is ideal for aeroplane journeys as it has none of those things nonmarital sex isnt even advocated i also absolutely love the stereotypical american family which support the film wonderfully meal time conversations present openings and visits to church are pulled off in hilarious style a fantastic bit of mid90s nostalgia which creates a warm feeling inside people may sneer but theres nothing wrong with that,happy
now this is a movie which will always be close to my heartthis a perfect romantic movie which will fill your heart with love and excitementlucythe character played by my favourite actress sandra bullock is more of a shy closet beautythe perfect girl i would want in my lifesandra bullock fills life in this charactershe just plays this character with so much perfection that you just cant help but love herwhile bill pullman plays a sweet brother character which shows his talent as a good actorthis sweet couple played by both actors and the magical romance which is their in the story of this film is beyond words all i can say is that this movie is worth watching at least once in life,happy
i thought this was an excellent movie it was funny and entertaining as well as well casted there are not too many movies that i want to watch again but i have seen this over 100 times and will watch it many more it seems to be so well written and directed that even when you know the ending you still get caught up in the emotions of the characters throughout the movie the late jack warden was fantastic but sandra bullock showed us how wonderful of actress she is and convinced the audience how she could fall in love with a family i think it is that it is more than just the average romance film where a man or a woman falls in love and has to overcome some obstacles to fulfill that love but how a woman can fall in love with a guy as well as his family,happy
believe it or not it was the first time i saw bill pullman acting he was just terrific as well as sandra bullock the movie is a lovely comedy in which lucy sandra bullock falls in love with jacks bill pullman brother peter a successful businessman every day her love grows as she always sees him on the subway while she works in a toll booth after an incident with peter lucy dives into his family as if she were his fianc confusion begins until jack peters brother notices lucy and falls in love with her as well it is a wonderful film full of surprises and bill pullman is simply great this is undoubtedly a mustsee movie,happy
when i told my husband the plot of this story the mistaken identity didnt sound plausible yet they did a wonderful job of making this believable the chemistry is amazing between sandra and bill pullman peter boyle was perfect i liked him so much in this role he was lovable and has some lines in this movie that were memorable the scene at mass was so funnyi now watch this every christmas it is romantic warm and funny the family was kind silly and loving toward one another lucy sees the value of family and the film does a great job of relaying this to the audience it will make you feel warm and tender about those you love and you will smilethe music is classic it fits the story perfectlyi love this movie,happy
this film is great it has a bit for everyone it has love comedy and tears if your one for the soopy films then this film will be the film for you it doesnt have a lot of action its more the film you would sit down with your girlfriends or even your boyfriend with a cup of coffee i watched this film once on christmas eve and for 2 years me and my mum were trying to find it but we counldnt remember the tite of it which didnt helpi have had this film for about 3 weeks now and i watch it with my mum every sunday with a box of tissues not far from use its really a family film that you watch with your kids its more something you watch by yourself or with some friends its about 88 minutes long and its worth watching it all when you start watching you wont want to turn it off i promise you,happy
this movie is one of my favorites because of the plot and the characters sandra bullock was lovely in this film as she is always i love the way she portrayed her character her smile her crazy laughter her twinkling eyes and bill pullman was great as jack callaghan the way he looks at people his stance both were amazing and they definitely have chemistry together if other people portrayed the roles of lucy and peter i doubt the movie would have been as sweet and romantic i never get tired of watching this movie  its one feel good flick and never fails to make me smile  and of course the other characters were fantastic and it seemed like they were all family really family hilarious scenes with joe jr ah yes hes not all that bad the callaghans were extremely nice and i wish really wish i have a family like that even the woman with a surgically improved nose helped in making the movie funnier if you guys are looking for something romantic funny and christmasy this is the movie to watch,happy
wonderful romantic comedy  but sometimes i wish the characters had been reversed  im a guy in the same position as lucy  dead parents no family  but this is never explored  sure would like to know why  excellent film however  great comedy even some drama involved  but lets do a guy film ok,happy
i just love the scene when shes about to marry peter and after she objects how much do you just love when she says im in love with your sonnot that onethat one she looks so adorable when she kind of curtsies as she points around peter to jack i just love love love that scene and the adorable look on jacks face upon hearing her words too its got to my in my top three of best romantic movies of all time  hey but maybe im partial i love sandra bullock and i love bill pullman too,happy
this is one of my top 10 movies  the chemestry between bill pullman and sandra bullock is wonderful the scenes with the two of them together were my favorite  jacks family is one of the funniest parts of the movie especially his father played by peter boyle of everybody loves raymond i highly recommend this movie,happy
at the beginning this movie looks like another silly watery pseudoromantic one with that unplausible story of a girl saving a man of being killed by a train after having fallen to the railway line and then trying to pass for his fiancee in the eyes of his family while he is in the coma at the hospital but as far as the plot develops itself we become conquered by the girls simple and naive behaviour and her display of nice sentiments we become also conquered by the wonderful family of the man in the coma who are such nice people that make us also wish to have had a family like that well after little time the story changes direction and takes a somewhat predictable one which is mildly interesting to follow and which i wont reveal here of course the end is also predictable but it will be dear to very romantic hearts well this is not a great movie because the story is too simple for that the characters are merely sketched and there is no deep insight of minds and behaviours but it will remind you of those old movies in which everyone was good and nice and there were neither villains nor violence of any kind,happy
i really like this movie because it shows that dreams can sometimes become true moreover the character of lucy played by sandra bullock who is so cute and sweet is really touching she is so lonely that she dreams her life and once that it almost becomes true she cant dare to tell the truth this movie is really cute every character is both funny and tender saul is funny when hes supposed to tell the truth the whole family is very funny more than being a nice movie it really feels true this movie reminds me of some aspects of my life and i do hope that ill be as happy as lucy,happy
is a wonderful charming and hilarious comedy that plays sunny side up with sandra bullock being her charming self as usual the movie is excellent and ive seen it 81 times and im still not sick of it yet the best movie ever,happy
there are terrific performances from everyone in this romantic comedy its one of my favorite films in this genre sandra bullock is at her sweetest and the laughs are still outloud even after seeing the movie many times if its on tvill be watching,happy
i have seen this movie when it first came out i absolutely fall in love with this sandra bullock and bill pullmans chemistry is great this movie is so warm and sweet whenever i see this i can barely sleep if you feel depressed or lonely see this youll love this,happy
wella funny film cheery and warmhearted but without any depth and thats just what its about it is entertaining and sometimes very jolly  the scene where peter sings the alphabet song to see if he really has amnesia or the paper boy who falls on his bikehowever the probability that someone looking like sandra bullock works in a subway station booth and spends her life alone is very low indeed,happy
there is something about the energy of this film  its cast its music its timing and writing it has a sweetness and a daftness that makes it so enjoyable and heartwarmingeveryone is perfectly cast when i was younger i wanted to believe they were all real and out there in the world being their quirky selves the scenes that involve family banter for me embody the joy of film and the joy that comes from watching an ensemble work so well togetherwith sandra bullock and bill pullman its next to impossible to fail at comedic timing they are exquisite together and make an onscreen connection that is beyond lovable and memorable to this day i pit all other romcom duos to these twothis film is a joy from my childhood not a year has passed since i first watched that it hasnt been revisited and cherishedi hope you watch and love it,happy
after her father dies lucy sandra bullock is left all alone with no family and nobody to share her life with so day after day she goes to work for the chicago transit authority and collects tokens in a small booth while everybody else go about their busy lives then one day she sees a handsome young man who helps old ladies get on the subway train and she falls headoverheels in love with him the only problem is that she doesnt know his name and he doesnt even know she exists that changes when he is pushed onto one of the tracks and lucy manages to drag his unconscious body off of the rails just before an oncoming train goes rushing by worried about his health lucy then goes to the hospital but is told that since she is not part of the family that she cannot see him however during the confusion she is introduced as the young mans fianc and since he is in a coma nobody is able to dispute the fact so the family welcomes her as one of their own but things dont exactly work out like lucy and everyone else expect now rather than reveal any more i will just say that this was a cute romanticcomedy which should appeal to most fans of the genre likewise those who like sandra bullock will probably have no reason to dislike this movie either in any case i enjoyed this film for the most part and i have rated it accordingly slightly above average,happy
its amazing to realize how much the romcom genre has evolved over the last 10 or 15 years compare for instance with must like dogs while still hewing to the traditional romcom plot arc the latter has subtlety wit depth and a delicate touch does noteverything about this movie is predictable including bullocks performance its interesting to see the earlier work of someone whos been in the business for over 15 years in her case as is the case with the bewilderingly overrated julia roberts bullock seems to have developed a set of pat reactions early on and not strayed too far from themthe only redeeming feature of this picture is that its not completely insulting to our intelligence plus there are some believable though stock performances by supporting players other than that it has nothing to offer,happy
describes exactly what i was doing through parts of this movie the plot was more predictable than any other movie ive seen and the acting in it was so monotonous that i could barely stay awake this movie was definitely a chick flick if even any women could like it,happy
sandra bullock is adorablebut as a mousy working girl with no real romantic opportunities bullock is so charming in this film that shes a little miscast she seems to have no real friends no family of her own a person this bubbly and sparkling would not be a house hermit but to buy into the situation as is means to be carried away by bullocks performanceand thats an easy task she lights up the screen but in a quiet easy way there were few chances for her to really be easy and natural in speed although i liked her worried line to the passengers are we dragging him when keanu reeves was under the bus and her brief appearance in the vanishing was just what that doomladen movie needed this picture seems to be tailored to her lowkeyed effervescence and sandras chemistry with bill pullman is exactly right she becomes friends with a loud jubilant family here her face lighting up in surprise at her own enjoyment and in these moments i couldnt have cared less about the trite setup of the plot the hectic finale or some of the wobbly writing as with a bad caveat about a character having one testiclenot good material for a comedy but the movie is quite enjoyable and romantic and it works the audience over gently with bullock and pullman in the leads it cant hardly miss  from ,happy
ill admit i have a soft spot for romantic comedies that sandra bullock stars in i think thats probably because she really is the queen of romantic comedies and can do the feel good stuff in a way other actresses dont was one of her early ones and although it drags on a bit is really a genuinely warm fun movie mainly because it combines three great things one it has romanceand plenty of it two the characters are both fun and funny and very human in a way that many characters in movies such as this arent the people in are all so adorable without being larger then life or unrealistic i liked thatthird this movie is wittier then you might expect and every so often a line would be thrown in that actually had me roaring which i didnt expect i knew this would be complete feel good stuff just from the previews but i didnt expect the wit and the funniest lines come so unexpectedly i like romantic comedies that can do witty and feel good simultaneously i also like screwball comedies much more then slapstick and this movie is built around that so it appealed to methe movie is predictable as anything but interestingly even those i know who dont like romantic comedies seem to be charmed by this im not sure why that is except maybe because theres such a likability about everyone in this movie and the premise was so original and pullmanwho i really like a lot as an actor and bullock are so natural together that the movie just appeals to many even many of those who dont normally like romantic comediesi was drawn to each and every character and liked the way everyone was developedeven peter for the brief time he actually wasnt managed to have a developed personality and some really funny scenes this movie isnt going to win any oscars but for what it is its very much worth watching and a strong 75 bullocks very good at doing these types of movies and this is one of her better ones,happy
i love this movie  it is my absolute favorite and my familys favorite too  we watch it at least three times a year especially at christmas time i laugh and cry every time i see it  while many people quote austin powers and tommy boy my sisters and i quote this movie nice    sweater know her im dating her  but all personal bias aside the thing that makes this movie so enjoyable and memorable and something that other moviemakers should consider is the development of all of the supporting characters  from the paper boy who falls off his bicycle which many movies copied after this one to the snotty hot dog vender to the sweet wellintentioned nurseeach adds something to the plot to the main characters and to the overall humor  many of the funniest lines are said by minor characters the hotel doorman joe jr peters hospital room buddy i look for this in other movies and dont see it much these days jon turtletaub is a wonderful director  another one of my favorite movies that he directed is disneys the kid which also has some great supporting roles  i recommend that one too this is sandra at her best  see this movie,happy
despite some great acting talents the other thing that made this film enjoyable was the sheer originality of it there are a lot of romantic comedies with stupid plots while thislike all romance film is very predictablethe plot of the film is quite funny and the acting helps a whole lot 35 starsjohn ulmer,happy
i hate romantic comedies first of all theyre not comic at all and secondly you just know that the girl will have her prince at the end am i the one to blame perhaps but certainly not in the case of this vehicle problems enough here sandra bullock looks pretty but she cant act how else would you explain that she only will be remembered for speed bill pullman has the same appeal as the role he playsexactly a carpenter and then the scenes first of all do they miss all sense of realitygirl who works in the metro sees a rich advocate whos beaten he fells on the rails no signs of any danger to be electrocuted and sandra bullock pushes him in pure indiana jonesstyle on the other side well we saw scenes who were more stupid but at the hospital some nurse introduces madame bullock as his financee because otherwise she has no right to visit her prince charming dont ask me why but i still decided to watch further perhaps i was in for torturing myself as the story goes on and on and gets more ridiculousat the time the poor man is in coma which is a good thing as peter gallagher is one of the most horrifying actors to look at the family believes it all and poor sandra becomes part of the family but not her so called brother in law as he starts investigating if shes the real financee or not and look what happenssandra bullock falls in love with mister pullman okay no further revealing from plots well if they can be called like that anyway but the movie gets sillier and boring and knowing the start was already terrible this can be perhaps the ultimate movie for desperate women who wanna have their dose of romantic but for chrissakes  get a life,happy
i found it difficult to identify or sympathise with any of the characters in this movie coming closest to one of the cats and that no doubt colours this review however i and my wife found that the script simply lacked humour using contrivance to make any progress the ice scene is pure klutz while potential resolutions or critical events were chopped or ignored as if the audience were expected to have its collective brain in neutral of the main characters not even the mostly comatose peter seemed plausible in his role even the other woman was eventually rendered silly and pointless by the scriptwriter despite a promising start and enthusiastic approach by ally walkerperhaps julia roberts should have taken this role and brought her scriptwriter with her her lightest comedies such as runaway bride are still better than this i would not see this movie again nor recommend it but then it will probably do you no great harm to see it for yourself when at least you can make up your own mind it had a chance to work and it is a pity the execution failed,happy
for simply delightful cinema one need go no further than jon turtletaubs film is far better than nora ephrons recent hit sleepless in seattle there is no blatant predictability nor obvious contrivances and this picture has considerable wit being oft times hilariousturtletaub has turned the everyday and the not so everyday into a collection of very funny situations with apparent ease while keeping the whole story very close to home he has graced the movie with enough off beat moments and quirky characters to really guarantee the audience much enjoymentessentially though this is romanticcomedy at its very best is most definitely romantic and successfully deals with personal ideals and the awkward reality of love and of course its heartwarming in its humour but what really makes the whole film work so successfully are the endlessly likable lead playerssandra bullock is totally charming and adorably lovable and is just beginning to show some real versatility following her role in the action blockbuster speed the homely good looks she possesses mean that miss bullock has no trouble winning hearts with a mere smile equally agreeable is bill pullman who plays second fiddle to the lovely miss bullock an unsung actor who was well overdue a chance to play a lead role after a string of impressive support roles including ruthless people the accidental tourist and sommersbyperhaps this picture does become a fraction contrived in the last ten minutes though it still remains an absolute joy over allfriday june 23 1995  waverley pinewood cinemaagain one of the most likable films of the year from director jon turtletaub the films simplicity is a big help with an amiable script telling an easy tale of love at second sightthe movies best asset is the very enjoyable cast lead by every girl sandra bullock whose girl next door charms will win your heart with ease with no outstanding performances support cast back up miss bullock most admirably with bill pullman especially enjoyable as the love lorn jack who has fallen head over heels for the slightly nutty lucythe comedy is marvellously handled by all concerned making the very most of this humorous pic peopled with eccentric characters as it is but its the romance that will win you over in the end best romanticcomedy of 1995saturday march 23 1996  video,happy
nice movie for any occasion a lighthearted romantic comedy for all ages not too diabetic or too bitter but just a perfect mixture of love friendship and family sandra bullock is perfect in her portrayal of lucy and so is bill pullman bullock and pullman combination works very well michael rispoli is fun in his joe jr role glynis johnspeter boyle micole mercurio monica keena and jack warden make up a great family peter gallagher looks real good when he is in comai have watched it over and over and simply never seem to get tired of it though the storyline is pretty predictable it is still kind of fun to watch it for bullock she really pulls it through and many could identify with her the dialogues are pretty funny especially the church episode one during the christmas dinner and the last hospital sceneit cannot the termed the greatest of all but if there is one movie i could recommend to watch again and again without getting bored its this one my only regret remains that i dont own the dvd ,happy
okay i cant stand sandra bullock but i could watch this movie a hundred times i own it it is romantic and hilarious the callahan family is so funny its non stop laughter from start to finish plus it adds in a little moral of the story about living what you dream and how family is so important a mustsee for the hopeless romantic basically the story goes like this on christams morning lucy a familyless woman saves a strangers life but he still winds up in a coma in the hospital the hospital staff wont let lucy see him since shes not family so by some strange misunderstanding word gets around to the doctors that she is this mans fianc even though shes never spoken to the guy before she stays by his side in the hospital and is accidentally introduced to his whole family as his fianc and thats just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie and thats where the real fun begins as for the rest of the story youll have to see for yourself,happy
this movie is not about glitz or hollywood fan fare it is a wonderful clean movie without showing cleavage every 30 seconds its about good hard working jeans wearing god fearing family people its easy to follow and i like that a lot i wish i could come up with a new complement to describe sandrabut they have all been used i believe what you see is what you get oh sure im sure she has her bad days and her crabby times we all do if she isnt the sweetest lady to hit the big screen id like to know who it is when saul says you jumped on the tracks i lose it for a moment every time i see it this has to the best romancecomedy of all times one would have to feel sorry for jack when he first meets lucy she bats her eye lashes at him doesnt he know what that means then she tells jack she doesnt have anyone hint hint at the dinner she gives him the i love you look he still doesnt wake up then she asks him if he can give her a reason not to marry his brother this guy is nice but dense oh well somehow he wins lucy at the end who would have thought,happy
this is a very refreshing film full of unexpected story turns that keeps you tied to your chair the whole time sandra plays her role so well that on many times you feel the joy sorrow pain and enjoyment she feels the story about a lonely girl in a ticket box at the station silently in love with a man that comes by each and every day without seeing her when she saves the man from a deadly fall for the train the man gets into a coma in order to see the man in hospital she poses as his fiance that works but then she meets the family of the man who never seen his fiance and instantly believe she is his fiance from that moment her life starts turning in many directions and she falls from one hilarious situation into the other the story line and the hilarious situations are always unexpected but never cheap or dull a film to see a dozen times,happy
sandra bullock is at her best when playing this kind of character shes lovable vulnerable and real she seems like someone youd know instead of an impossibly glamorous movie character we own this dvd and watch it over and over again the supporting cast shines as well peter boyle micole mercurio glynis johns monica keena and jack warden make the callaghan family so endearing that its easy to see why lucy bullock would want to be part of it peter gallagher is great as the self absorbed object of lucys affectionthis isnt a movie thats deep or thought provoking its just a lot of fun and sweet another of those rare movies that you can watch with your family there are a couple of questionable instances regarding breast enhancement and accident involving a pencil the movie would not have missed them had they been omitted but there is more good than bad here,happy
this is the most romantic movie i have seen in many years i love the actors and the story i am 68 years old and this story takes me back when i was in my 20s and 30s i watch this movie every day when i have time jack warden is a wonderful actor jack is the very best i cant say enough about him he is romantic funny good looking  he is the age of my oldest daughter the story he tells lucy about what leaning means is so impressive i could cry no other actor could have put it over as well i think he must be a very underrated actor because i never hear anything about him i am going to check out the names of the mother i know peter boyle is the father the sister is wonderful the actor who played joe jr is excellent i have never seen him before the grandmother is as good as she has ever been and i have seen her in many movies over the years i wish i had seen this movie when it first came out this year i have found it and i am very very happy thank you for listening florence stockton reno nevada florriebbcsbcglobalnet,happy
this is one of the better movies of its genre sandra bullock plays a likable girl whose main desire in life is to get a stamp in her passport from a foreign country having lost both parents she lives with her cat in a small chicago apartment with her cat and has to avoid the stereotypical italian a la andrew dice clay supers sons advancesshe works as a token booth clerk and fantasizes about a rich passenger that passes her booth daily one day he is pushed to the tracks by some teens and knocked unconscious bullock jumps to the tracks and saves him and then goes with him to the hospital he is in a coma and when his family comes to visit they mistakenly think that bullock is his fiancebullock doesnt have the heart to tell them she isnt especially because they are so nice and provide bullock with the family affection that she is missing it gets real interesting when bullock slowly starts falling for the coma mans brother tension mounts knowing that when the coma man wakes bullock will be exposed as a fakethis was a really fun movie,happy
this is a movie that i anxiously waited to see from the moment it was released in theaters and when i finally saw it a week after its video release i was not the least bit disappointed  this is one of my favorite films to come along in recent years  it has many funny and delightful moments from start to finish and everyone in the film did a great job  the lovely and talented sandra bullock was especially delightful  i very highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and thats in need of some good heart warming entertainment,happy
this is one of the best romance films ive ever seen i think a lot of romances are kid of goofy they dont make any sense but this one is truly romantic funny and the actors are really great especially bill pullman,happy
i remember the night i watched this film about 4 or 5 years ago and eventually i made my own review after that and i said that this will be on my all time listrecently i rent it again and i know that i was wrong i dont love it but i love love love love it multiply by 1000lol sandra bullock is one of my favorite actress and this film confirmed that once and for all the chemistry is great the comedy is flawless and sandra is my dream kinda woman the story is cliche but the warmth that it left behind is lingering forever i will watch this again and again 1010,happy
i have seen many famous romantic comedies like never been kissed my best friends weddingthe wedding planneretcbut none of them has impressed me as much as while you were sleepingthe movie is absolutely funnybrilliantthe casts are really great sandra bullock has shown her greatest performance she has ever made it seems that she was born to act romantic comedy an amazing and gorgeous movie for everybodymy score 910,happy
this film could easily be recommended as an overthe counter prescription against depression  it is quite simply charming  before i saw it i admit i was not the greatest sandra bullock fan ten minutes into the film i had more than changed my mind and made a complete 180 degree turn in my opinion of her  sandra bullock is truly endearing in this hilarious case of mistaken identity romanticcomedy its easy to see how she has become a household name after itthere is really something fresh sincere and approachable but also compellingly vulnerable about her character lucy eleanor moderatz  yet we cannot help but admire her integrity her battle of conscience against continuing to deceive peters family and wonderwhy should she be lonely  why is it so wrong what shes doing since shes clearly come to love this family  the interesting unusual view of a typical chicago winter and delightfully quirky writing in as well as the fine performances of the supporting cast are also an integral part of the overall success of this film  bill pullmans character jack the hardworking everyman is not presented in a patronising light and i found this ordinary hero refreshing  so many more patrician films tend to praise the likes of his elder brother the highly successful powerwealthdriven businessman peter and portray the hardworking everyman as nothing more than a crass boor with few or with obscure ambitions moreover sandras portrayal of the sweet but unglamorous nextdoor girl turned heroine lucy shines among a plethora of more common female performances in films such as pretty woman which more directly resort to an overt cinderella storyline  is among the best romanticcomedies of all time  anyone with a sense of humor could not be disappointed by it  my rating at least a 910,happy
this movie has everything a good romantic movie needs it has humor it has good actors and it has the romance sandra bullock plays a person who everyone would like to be who is shy and loving the shots has been taken great and the music is terrific the film gives a good christmas atmosphere its a great movie to watch with your date or just with your friends watch and enjoy,happy
was the movie where sandra bullock stole the tiara of americas sweetheart from julia roberts head  america fell in love with bullock who portrayed lucy a young woman orphaned and alone in the world she works at the rail station taking tokens from the commuters one of whom is peter gallagher peter callaghan  seeing peter enter the turnstile each day lucy develops a crush but is too shy to even speak to him  lovingly watching him one day she witnesses peter being mugged and she heroically saves his life  accompanying him to the hospital she is mistaken by a nurse as his fiancee  when his family the callaghans each actor in this ensemble was absolutely loveable burst into the hospital room it is obvious that they dont see comotose peter a highly successful professional in the big city often and they eagerly believe that lucy is peters fiancee  when lucy tries to protest then witnesses peters grandmother having a weak heart spell she goes along with the liethis is a heartwarming story that your entire family will love  bullock is so lonely yet so adorable that you want with all your heart for her to marry into the wonderful callaghan family  will her mistaken identity be revealed  i wont tell you but i will tell you that this movie with a christmastime setting has joined my collection of videotapes that i pop in the vcr for family on christmas day along with a christmas story its a wonderful life etc,happy
usually i hate romantic movies i got hauled in to see by a friend and was delighted its great to see a romance that focuses on something besides sexthe cast of characters yes with a capital c is a dickensian delight joe jr who barbecues in the stairwell and claims to have invented aluminum foil manages to be slimy and endearing at the same timemost important of all features two lovebirds who try to do the right thing even when it breaks their hearts the scene between lucy and jack in the stairwell the night before the wedding is material for morals training i hope hollywood makes more like this one,happy
just a year after her role in speed the leading actress came out with this charming romantic comedy and i adore it basically lucy eleanor moderatz golden globe nominated sandra bullock a lonely ticket seller and one day she sees the man of his dreams but she also sees him get mugged this mugging sends this man known as peter callaghan american beautys peter gallagher into a coma and when she goes to hospital to visit him the nurse tells his family that lucy is his fiance lucy cannot get the courage to tell the truth and the family including peters father ox peter boyle his mother elsie glynis johns his godfather saul jack warden the only one who finds out her secret before everyone else and his brother jack callaghan bill pullman have all taken her in as a new member of the family while spending a lot of time with the family as peter is still in the coma lucy is falling head over heels in love with jack peter does eventually come out of his coma and lucy doesnt know what to do because he doesnt remember her except go along with the idea that he is suffering very mild amnesia eventually it seems peter does accept that there should be a wedding and he can see himself falling in love with lucy as the years go by so the big day comes lucy knows she truly loves jack but she doesnt know that before his coma peter proposed to another woman so this is when lucy confesses all but says she fell in love with the family ever since the engagement she does eventually get her happy ending where she finds a new husband in jack and a new loving family also starring michael rispoli as joe joey fusco jr jason bernard as jerry wallace micole mercurio as midge callaghan and ally walker as ashley bartlett bacon with some good giggles and a good message that love can be at first sight but getting to know someone is the much better idea this is a film you cant help but enjoy very good,happy
sandra bullock plays a lonely lady who works in a toll booth for the elevated train in chicago her life is so empty that she begins fantasizing about having a relationship with a handsome customer one day this customer is robbed and thrown onto the track as a train is coming sandra pulls him off the track and accompanies his to the hospital as hes in a coma through a funny mistake the hospital staff thing shes his fiance and the problem quickly snowballs when his family arrives and they too think shes engaged to their sonthis is a lovely romantic comedyone of the best of the last several decades also despite this very simple plot the film does a great job of setting the mood and creating characters you will love its very engaging and sweet and i enjoyed it significantly more than sleepless in seattle another fine filmmostly because the film has such a great sense of humor oddlydespite having so much going for it the rating for this is surprisingly low her on imdb and leonard maltins guide also gives it a pretty low score while i may sound like a fathead i really cant understand why the score is so low as the writing is so clever the acting excellent and the ensemble supporting cast so sweet while not being saccharinea wonderful and nearly perfect filma terrific date movie or just a film if you could use a laugh or smile,happy
this is the film that really made sandra bullock a star i believe speed came out just before and it got her noticed but this was the movie that really made her career it is too bad she has had nothing quite as good as this sincethe dialog in this film is extremely clever the humor and the musical soundtrack are perfectly orchestrated with each other it is true that the family that sandras character meets is rather silly  but they are so endearing it is impossible not to appreciate them glynis johns and peter boyle  what great character actors they have been over the years they were delightfulsandras character sneaking to the back entrance of her chicago apartment to avoid her scrungy icky neighbor her accidentally letting the christmas tree fall out of the window the music at the party stopping at a very inopportune moment for bill pullman sandras character saying hello to her boyfriends cat for the first time there are several comic moments in this movie too numerous to mentionwhat ties the whole movie together is however the thoughtful parts of the script sandras character is lonely and for some reason it comes across as being very human many of us can relate to her and that is why i suspect that this film was held over in theatres for as long as it was i saw it 5 times in the actual theatre and enjoyed it all 5 times she wanted a family for christmas and not to be alone i know this sounds so cheesy but it is portrayed brilliantly hats off to the marvelous people who wrote this screenplay they know their craft wellit is extremely sad that richard roeper has badmouthed this movie as an obnoxious chicago movie nothing could be further than the truth there are many obnoxious movies set in chicago but this is definitely not one of themgreat script great soundtrack great movie if you have not seen it it is worth a look,happy
even though she showed a deft touch for racist vitriol in paul haggis crash sandra bullock will forever be etched as the lovable girlnextdoor from this winsome 1995 romantic comedy directed by jon turteltaub in a vehicle that was written originally for demi moore by daniel g sullivan and fredric lebow bullock shines as lucy moderatz a lonely token collector at a chicago ltrain station the plot focuses almost completely on lucy and how she becomes involved with not only peter callaghan the object of her romantic fantasies but his loving family as well it all turns on a train platform incident where muggers have pushed peter onto the tracks at which point lucy saves him from an oncoming trainthe seemingly innocent deception begins when a hospital nurse assumes that lucy is peters fiance since he is comatose and she is smitten with the man she thinks he is the charade gets bigger as the callaghans welcome her with open arms however the inevitable complications ensue when peters brother jack enters the picture at first suspicious but thenwell you can figure out the rest there are definitely some narrative lapses that make this film less than logical for example the callaghans somewhat blas attitude toward peters comatose state once they meet lucy regardless turteltaub manages to make the lightweight film feel like a throwback to an earlier era of romantic comediesbill pullman makes a nice casual leading man as jack and there is genuine chemistry between the two stars the rest of the cast is sharp and funny in particular peter boyle as the callaghan paterfamilias a far warmer variation than his everybody loves raymond curmudgeon glynis johns as the dotty grandmother not that far removed from her maternal suffragette in mary poppins michael rispoli as lucys persistent suitor and wannabe crossdresser joe jr jack warden as understanding uncle saul and peter gallagher nicely underplaying the lessthanideal peter but its bullocks show and no matter how many times she has recycled her persona on lesser comedies since then its her sincerity selfdeprecating manner and plainfaced beauty that makes this movie one of the better studio confections of the 1990s the 1998 dvd has no extras,happy
this is my very favorite movie its true i think i have been watching it one hundred times at least i just loooooove it bill pullman and sandra bullock is the perfect couple and the story is fantastic the ending could maybe be more romantic but butit is great all overfor all the newinlove couples i will say run to the nearest videoshop and rent it nowthis is in my eyes the best movieperformance sandra bullock ever have done i dont love any other movies she has acted in no bill pullman also do a great performance in the film as the man she fall in love in at second sightfor the people who dont like this film i will sayits okay not everyone can be romantic because if you doesnt feel anything while youre watching the film you can not be a romantic person the story is too breathtaking to not touch  you at all enjoy watching it,happy
was by no means the worst of the romantic comedies but it did leave a lot to be desired  it just seemed like the movies plot was awfully convoluted to me  watching this film gave me a rather large headache,happy
i have seen while yws maybe three or four times during the last few years  i liked it much two days ago i decided to watch it once again as it was on tv and i liked it even more actually i loved it this is a wonderful romantic film with a beautiful score and a beautiful cast especially sandra bullock does a great job  she presents lucy as a very beautiful character to me is next to sleepless in seattle and titanic if you consider it a romantic movie the most wonderful romantic movie of all time1010,happy
this is a very heartwarming story about a cta worker lucybullock who is in love with a man that she has never meet petergallagher when he is put into a comma and wakes up not remembering much at all what other choice does he have but to say he remembers proposing to her meanwhile lucy makes her way into peters family which includes very attractive jackpullman this makes it a love triangle impossible to not like,happy
while this film was utterly predictable it oozed charm from every pore definitely enough to make one overlook its faults this was the first sandra bullock film i have seen and her charm and regular girl beauty are really something the director made some good moves contrasting sandralucy often seen alone to the family of peter usually sweeping into a scene four or five at a time but the main attraction of this film is of course the winsome sandra bullock i will have to see some more of her work grade b,happy
i simply love it ive watched it over 10 times and the feelgood touch is still fabulous the excellent elements in the show are the homey christmas feeling the superb score the excellent portrayal of the characters by each and every cast member the romantic and sweet story and the whole package makes this movie the ultimate romantic comedy ever and especially after watching it more than 3 times the jokes are really naturally put and better understood and makes the show even more worth watching this movie must be watched the best time to watch it is with your family or loved ones at night and best if during the christmas season with everyone all snuggled up and feeling great and prepare at least a piece of tissue if youre an easy tearer,happy
if going into a coma would lead to waking up engaged to a loveable woman like lucy sandra bullock i would go searching for an accident right awaythis movie is a sweet romantic film based on misunderstandings yet avoiding being embarrassing the main character lucy is a lonely dreaming romantic with whom i can easily relate the callaghan family which she is suddenly and rapidly becoming a part of is portrayed as the very opposite though in a warm and loving manner maybe that is what appeals most to me in this movie the romantic dream becomes a wish for a caring environment rather than for a perfect lifewatching this movie one may find it unrealistic that a person as likeable as lucy would ever need to be lonely but the truth is that there are lots of real people just as likeable and just as lonely this movie may give some hope,happy
i love this film its the sweetest cutest most loveliest romantic movie ive ever seen i cant imaging anybody not liking it sandra bullock is as sweet as ever making a perfect couple with the cute bill pullman even if you are not too much into romantic movies youll love this one,happy
okay yes this film is implausible and makes a virtue of its lying heroine yet this is one of the sweetest romantic films of the decade played winningly by all actors concerned put aside your cynicism for a moment watch it with your sweetie and dont be such a grump,happy
is an excelent movie with good values and holsom clean humor in this day and age you dont see many good clean movies i recomend this movie for people of all ages enjoy,happy
is my alltime favorite movie  sandra bullock was perfect for the role of lucy the endearing character whose confession at the wedding makes me cry every time i see it  the whole cast really brought the charactes to life and made it easy to feel the emotions they display i love the way lucy begins the story by telling us of her one true love and ends the story by telling usthank goodness my father was right  things dont always turn out the way you plan  she had planned on peter but jack was the only one for her  he gave her the one gift she wanted so badlya stamp on her passport,happy
has everything i need in a movie really nice and cosy feeling comedy romance and some action its one of the best movies ive ever seen and it makes me feel really good when i watch it,happy

i consider myself a romantic and maybe that is one of the main reasons i love this movie so much  sandra bullock is one of my favorite actresses if not my fav and she is delightful in this  the story is cute the acting is wonderful and everything falls into place where and how it should  i highly recomened seeing this movie especially with a date have fun,happy
i have probably watched this film about 30 times now sad i know but its still the best film i have seen in a long time  its filmed in chicago and having visited there once brings back wonderful memoriessandra bullock once again plays a single girl looking for love  she falls in love with a man peter who she has never even spoken to but who she sees everyday waiting for a tube on the loop  he falls she saves his life and the nurse at the hospital gets confused and thinks that lucy bullock is his fiancee  all through you keep thinking why on earth would she fall for a man like peter in the first place especially when you see his brother jack who is just sooo lovelybut it all turns out well in the end when lucy bullock admits at her wedding to peter that she cant marry him as she is in love with jack pullman who in turn is also in love with her,happy
gives the possibilities that love at first sight really happens  bill pullman and sandra bullock give great convincing performances as two people falling in love knowing that the chance of actually getting together is slim i recommend this movie times ten go out and rent it and see for yourselves,happy
there isnt much that i need to add to the previous comments regarding this film i bought it last week and have seen it 3 times since and im still not bored of course the performances of both pullman and bullock are great however after a couple of times of watching this movie i notice more details like the music the next time you watch this film try listening for the music score music sometimes tells you more than the actors on your screen the music to this movie is humor itself and reflects the atmosphere the tensions between the main characters the misunderstandings etc very well,happy
after supporting sly stallone in demolition man and keanu reeves in speed sandra bullock headlines her own movie in this enjoyable romantic comedy plot in a paragraph romantic lucys sandra bullock life consists of constant loneliness and daydreaming of marrying prince charming that is until she saves peter gallaghers played by peter gallagher life now she is a part of his family and with a strong heart and fate on her side others begin to realise what a terrific person she is especially jack bill pullman peters brother an extraordinarily sequence of events begin to take place as lucy and jack become closer of the cast bill pullman is at his affable best this is the type of role that suits him best peter gallagher doesnt have that much to do but does it well enough peter boyle is great as ox jason bernhard is brilliant as jerry and jack weston is wonderful as saul too as for sandra bullock she is at her charming sweet self here today she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply any movie becomes promising just by having her name in its castat must watch at christmas if you are feeling romantic,happy
i confessthis movie is cheesy corny and clich in every possible way as an author i should be appalled but you know what im not i love a good chick flick and this ticks all the boxes the truth is if you want a girly movie youre going to have to put up with clichs the moment peter fell onto the tracks it was clear what was going to happen yet somehow it made the movie so much more enjoyable i love the acting of sandra bullock and bill pullman they both just work so well together this movie is one i love to sit and watch on a lazy saturday night when my husband is doing something else an amazing feelgood movie that has you grinning like an idiot at the end despite how predictable it is,happy
i am not really a fan of chick flicks i think they are only good when its raining outside however i am a big fan of sandra bullock so i watched it this film did not make me laugh or want to fall in love all over again but it sure gave me a warm smile in my heart it doesnt bore you at all entertaining for sure you wont notice how much time you spent facing the screen i was just surprised peter gallagher used to do this kind of role you know hahaha i was kinda hooked with his role as arthur in covert affairs it sure has the sandra b charm i will surely watch it all over again and i recommend it to women who live alone and watch tv with their cats or to ladies living with roomies this could bring in some giggle ,happy
so i was watching this movie last yeardec 2013 on tv during the xmas season and i had to do a review on it so here it isis a 1995 romantic comedy about a lonely woman named lucysandra bullockwho is unlucky when it comes to love and men as she is working in a booth at a train station in chicago she meets a handsome man called peterpeter gallagher who is taking a train journey and she develops feelings for him as he comes by everyday to get a ticket from her boothbut when two teenagers thrown him off the train stationlucy saves him from a train coming on the train tracks by jumping into the tracks to get him out and he goes to hospitalwhile she is there at the hospital she blurts out and i was gonna marry him and the nurse mistakes her for peters fianc so peters family visit peter at the hospital and from here on in they presume that lucy is peters fiancas peter is in hospital lucy spends some time with his family and later meets peters brother jackplayed by casper star bill pullman but then she starts to fall in love with him and must decide how long will her facade with peter end and which man does she love more jack or peterbottom line i loved while you were sleepingsimilar to the 2009 film the proposal where bullocks margaret made out she was engaged to andrew but later falls in love with him for real i really enjoyed this filmsandra bullock was really good in this movie and her chemistry with bill pullman as jack was so cutei wish i could buy this on dvd but its impossible to get it only online but the next time its on tv i will definitely be recording it on vhsoverall is a thumbs up and a great film to watch at xmas time as its always on tv at xmasalso without giving too much away the ending was so adorable but my only concern is the movie posterits kinda making the film predictable as you know what man she chose in the end judging by the picture but still i loved this moviethey just dont make movies like that anymore only know and again1010ps i finally got it on dvd and i really loved this movie,happy
first of all the main weak point of this movie is an initial notsoconvincing misunderstanding between lucy sandra bullock and the callaghan family and the entire movie is standing on this persistent misunderstanding the callaghan family may be funny but did not necessarily have to be stupid however if this initial weak point can be ignored the rest of the movie is a simple fairy tale told in a charming and lovely way the activities of the callaghan family is hilarious although it seems to be a problem to understand sandra bullocks babbling she mumbles most of the time she is cute in her oversized outfits carrying a lonely bored puzzled cravingforlove type of a disposition it is totally impossible to imagine demi moore in lucys role which was originally written for ms moore bill pullman is irresistibly attractive in the role of jack callaghan bullock and pullman make a real romantic couple pullman has lovely hair and a great smile the ending however has lost its intensity and was not so thoughtfully projected the movie is overall entertaining i rate it 7 out of 10,happy
lucy eleanor moderatz sandra bullock is grownup who works at a train station on christmas day she meets peter callahan peter gallaugher a young man who comes to her window everyday he is unfortunately mugged by robbers and is left unconscious lucy saves him but is caught up in the middle of confusion everyone thinks that lucy and peter are engaged peter meanwhile is in a coma his brother jack bill pullman is wanting to give up the family business a furniture companyeventually lucy tells the godfather of peter saul jack warden who wants to tell the family but is lackluster at it when peter wakes up he doesnt remember lucy they think he has amnesia but he starts naming several things before the accident the alphabet his eighth grade locker combination and the likethis is a chick flick so im not a huge fan avoid it unless you like any of the actorsactressesmy score 510,happy
i thought it was time to see this again after all these years and it is just as fresh and wonderful as it was when it came out like the smell of bread just taken from the oven it is an exhilarating and essentially perfect romantic comedy it comes off so wonderfully because of the central casting of the irresistibly charming sandra bullock whatever she lacks in vogue cover beauty she makes up for in tsunamis of personality who could say no to her all she has to do is just smile or just look at you well bill pullman certainly cant resist her in this film and neither could his family this film is so famous that most people know the story which is the ingenious notion that bullock saves the life of a handsome young man played by peter gallagher who is mugged and falls unconscious onto an overground subway track in front of an oncoming express train in chicago bullocks leaps down rolls over with him and they just make it she goes with him to the hospital but they wont let her follow him in because she is not a family member so she pretends to be his fiance then the story takes place while he is ie in a deep coma where gallaghers family accept him as his fiance and she is in countless comedic situations of having to pretend to know all sorts of things about him in fact she had been in love with him for a long time but they had never really met it is a great idea and it works to absolute perfection there are many many laughs the film was magnificently directed by jon turteltaub which means turtle dove in german just in case you wondered who came from the unlikely background of having previously directed gasp gulp 3 ninjas 1992 believe that if you can this film is the only listed writing credit for daniel g sullivan and fredric lebow what happened to them surely they should have gone on writing stuff of this calibre did a hole in the earth open up and swallow them the story and script are absolutely brilliant bill pullman is also perfectly cast as the brother of gallagher who falls in love with bullock but nobly refrains from doing anything about it jack warden provides heavyweight backup as family friend uncle saul the dotty family are all marvellous everybody is marvellous everything is marvellous the film is marvellous get the picture,happy
despite the opening song number being one of my own personal pet peeves this is one of my favorite films it is a genius parody of the romantic comedy genre that plays with your expectations now this film has almost as many holes as the dark knight rises and more coincidences than the complete works of charles dickens but the likable characters and the spot on comedic timing more than make up for any and all failingsthis film looks at all the tropes and clichs of chick flicks and exploits them for well earned laughs including one of the funniest breakup scenes of all time all the humor lands perfectly and hits its mark the only problem i can find would be the product placement dunkin donuts bringing families together for years america runs on dunkinall in all its an enjoyable film that will play around with your expectations and moves along at a perfect pace this is a film you can just pop in and watch any time you could watch it multiple times in a row without ever getting tired of it the problem though and the reason i believe for the 65 rating is that people go in expecting a straight romantic comedy and see only the films weaker aspects i say take a look,happy
over the year theres been no shortage of romantic comedies occasionally one comes along that stands out as this one did as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeali had never noticed sandra bullock until the film she made just before this one  speed not my type of film really then she followed up with this film and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actressesthis film is utterly charming without being sweet bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her then through a series of misunderstandings people begin believing she is the fiance of a man in a comaa man she has long had a secret crush on will they get married it seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma one of the most special things about this film in the sense of family even though the family is a bit oddbullock is tremendous here and this may be her best film peter gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma yet his role is not a strong one bill pullman not a favorite of mine actually has a very good role here and does exceptionally well with it micole mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good as is peter boyle  another actor who was never high on my list glynis johns is a hoot though again shes not one of my favorites and perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to jack warden  a godfather and friend of the family who becomes bullocks friend as wellif you like romantic comedies youll probably love this film highly recommended with little to criticize,happy
sandra bullock is lucy a somewhat meek unassuming person with a menial job that suits her she sells tokens for the transit system she has fallen in love with a man she never meets but she sees him regularly as he goes to work she would never be brave enough to strike up a conversation with himthe businessman is peter gallagher as peter but one fateful day he falls and lucy sees it she rushes to his rescue to keep him out of harms way later when she goes to the hospital to see how he is doing they wont let her in because she is not a relative so she makes up the story during the heat of the moment that she is his fiancethis strikes all the family members as strange that peter would have a fiance and not have told anyone particularly suspicious was peters brother bill pullman as jackbeing the meek type lucy doesnt reveal the truth and actually goes along with the ruse which works because peter has amnesia from his fall and becomes adjusted to the fact that he is to marry her but jack remains skepticalgallagher and pullman are excellent in their roles but this is mainly a vehicle for bullock a good role and an entertaining moviespoilers peter and lucy get all the way to the altar friends and family in attendance and jack as best man but lucy cant go through with it as she got to know him peter was not someone she could fall in love with however she had in the process fallen in love with jack instead and the feeling was mutual,happy
i had seen this movie quite a few years ago and i didnt remember it very well it was nine oclock and i was bored out of my mind i checked the tv guide and saw that was about to start i sat down and smiled for a whole two hours it may be the cheesiest movie ever but it makes you feel so good and its so sweet of course a movie with bill pullman is pretty much always good  ive always had a little thing for him i dont know quite what it is about him though the only thing i dont get is this ive read all of the 48 reviews on this site and i cant understand why it got such a low rating everyone seemed to enjoy it except one person and it only got a 6610 i would at least give it an 8510 or maybe even a 910 because even though it wasnt the best movie of all times it truly was a feelgreat movie and very recommendable to anyone who enjoys a good romantic movie,happy
this film has to be classed as brilliant  take a normal lonely girl one gorgeous male and add a sweet very cute brother and you get this film  it is a good romantic film for all the family the moral of the story  you may think it is love at first sight but try looking a second time,happy
sighthis is an unabashed for the diehard romatics movie it has all the ingredients of one  the elusive prince charming a hopeless romantic and christmas there have been many similar moviesbed of roses but still wyws holds its own and wins because of some excellent acting witty dialogues and an aura that is so warmmaybe its just christmas sandra bullock is a really beautiful and talented actress her confession in front of the whole family saying that she loves jackbill p and not peterpeter g is really well rendered and bill pullman well the man really doesnt have to do that much hes just simply mind blowing but as usual he does a great job as jack the rest of the supporting cast forming the callaghan family have done a great job but yes the best among the supporting cast would have to be the guy who acted as joe fuscomichael r hes really cute theres just one thing id like to add part of the aura of this movie is the fact that its shot in chicago the city is a lving breathing integral part of the movie and the reason for some of its beautythis movie stands as one of those really heartwarming unadulterated romances that i hope will be made more often with someone like sandra bullock who because shes not soo obviously beautiful as julia roberts is more endearing and humanvery human,happy
so its a trifle predictable  and saccharine  and its the stereotypical chickflick  but is charming and cute not deep but enjoyable none the less  sandra bullock and bill pullman have such a natural onscreen chemistry it seamlessly moves the story along  ive made it a tradition to watch exactly once every year during christmas just to remind myself that sure it may be just hollywood fluff but true love isnt always just a metaphor sigh,happy
this is the first review ive ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments i would like to add mine too there was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so i dug out my copy of wyws and settled down on the sofa although i know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow although peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between lucy and jack is without doubt very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly there are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted how i wish i could be adopted by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season if youre an old romantic like me and hey im not that old lol give this a try ive given it a 10 because there isnt anything to dislike,happy

i have often wondered why bill pullman didnt become a bigger star than he is hes played the romantic interest in a few films starring opposite two of the romcom queens  meg ryan and sandra bullock he was even great in independence day and he is great in this film too with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is lucy falls in love with his character sandra bullock does well in her role too its not an outstanding performance but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that shes cute and easy to watch on screen recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies,happy
absolutely loved this movie have always been a fan of sandra bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations i was watching it thinking this is the best fun ive had watching a movie in a long long time all throughout i could not wipe the giant grin on my face i found it very very funny at points and as i say again one of the best feel good films ive seen in a long long time very well acted by all that were involved especially sandra bullock and bill pullman at the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness i would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again,happy
the genre of romantic comedies may not be a genre producing depthful insights dramatic acting or meaningful moralsbut it centers about the two most warm and nice emotions humour and love there cant be nothing wrong with this now many movies of this genre are just what you expect they are cheesy diabetesinducing sweet shallow movies sometimes the humour outweighs the love so much it becomes intolerable sometimes the love aspect is so heavy you are forced to vomit then many movies make the mistake of mixing love with lust or even replacing them that does not go for romantic in my opinion so the moviegoer is left with only a few notable movies which make your heart glow there are pretty woman notting hill when harry met sally sleepless in seattle you got mail theres something about mary and of course while you were sleepingunlike some others in my listing this movie sets his characters in a real normal life they are all average people who could live next your door thats one point in making this movie memorable because if such a sweet love can happen to those guys it can happen to you as wellthe story may seem to be a bit far fetched girl saves guy gets mistaken for his fianc family invites her over for christmas she falls in love with the brother and so on but it is not as far fetched as a millionaire falling for a prostitute a journalist falling for just a boys story and drives through the us to seattle or a movie star just walking in a normal bookstorethe humour is great soft and loving instead of cynical the only cynical remark if you fit in my pants ill kill myself is like you are kidding around with your friends the love is also sweet it never becomes sexual or lustladen just pure love unlike all the aforementioned movies here another love is playing a role the love for and of a family anyone who like bullocks character has lived without any family for some time knows what i speak ofthe acting is good not great as i said i dont expect that in a romantic comedy but better than in most other movies of that genre and many other genres as wellthe last great point for this movie are the characters the movie makes no point in creating a despicable mean character the family callaghan are so nice and warm even peter who the viewer gets to know only a lot later in the movie seems to be able to leave his playboy life and settle with sandra bullock also heartwarming is the role of joey fusco he seems to really love sandra bullock in his own way he tries to protect her and be a real friend though he is obviously not her type even the real fianc of peter callaghan ashley does not come evil just shallow and possessive her appearance lasts only a few minutes tooall in all if youre looking for a great movie to make you feel good get this one,happy
even though im not the biggest fan of romantic comedies i do like to watch one occasionally as long as they are at least somewhat original  which sometimes seems harder to find than you would like to believe  i really can have a good time with them but for some reason i feared that this movie wouldnt belong to that category and thats why it took me almost ten years to finally watch it now that i did i know that i shouldnt have waited that longlucy is already in love with peter for a very long time the only problem is that she has never really spoken to him and that he probably doesnt even know of her existence hes a commuter to who she sells a ticket for the metro every day when on christmas day hes attacked by some muggers he falls on the rails and lies there unconscious lucy doesnt hesitate but immediately goes after him and saves him from the oncoming train then he goes into a coma and is transported to hospital and thats where all the problems start the hospital staff confuses her for his fiance which they also tell to his family they immediately welcome her into the family and lucy who isnt used to so much family happiness and warmth isnt able to tell them that she and peter havent got a relationship to make things even more complicated for her peters brother falls in love with her and when peter himself wakes up he too believes that she is his fianceeven though the story feels a bit like all other romantic comedies i must say that i like the new approach of a man in coma as the subject of affection even though he plays a very important role in this movie his performance only consists of lying there with his eyes closed and somehow that feels more ok than seeing yet another clumsy guy who is able to win the heart of the woman of his dreams but not only the story is ok so is the acting sandra bullock jack warden bill pullman were nice to watch and even though peter gallagher didnt really have a difficult part he too did a good jobi guess the only problem that i had with this movie was that it was situated during christmas time while i saw it in the beginning of september im not saying that i wasnt able to get completely involved in it but somehow it felt a bit weird to see snow and to see them decorate the christmas tree thats also the reason why i believe that this is a perfect movie to play in that time period instead of the christmas classic the sound of music youre already completely in the right mood then and im sure that such a movie would only add to that perfect feeling of family happiness but than again its not that you cant watch this movie on another day eitherall in all this is one of the better romantic comedies that ive seen lately i had some good laughs with it the romance was a bit weird but believable the acting was good and the story original what more can you expect from such a movie not much if you ask me and thats why i give it a welldeserved 710,happy
sandra bullocks   follows in the tradition of the classic romantic comedies of the 30s  40s and 50s with a enough modern elements to make you believe this story could really happen old fashioned romance is played out in more than one way when you see not only the dynamics of lucys crush from afar but with the family who adopts her for the holidays instead of focusing on who will win in the love triangle for the entire film the viewer gets to enjoy the give and take between the other family members and the chemistry that attracts lucy to them even though she knows she is living a lie even the smaller supporting characters are pillars in the plot development and take you on twists and turns as to who ends up with who in the end  a great film that drives home the point that you dont just date a person  you date a family with all of its quirks and qualities that will determine your entire happily ever after,happy
clearly one of our familys favorite comedies incredible acting so many memorable lines worth retelling my only complaint about this movie is directed against the studio that made it how could they possibly release this movie on dvd and not add one speck of additional information im dieing to know how many takes the john wayne dinner discussion took id love to see outtakes from some of those scenes where is the fulllength commentary by bullock pullman or others please please give us a special edition dvd of this incredible film,happy
this movie is simply the bestsandra bullock rocks in her role and all the others from bill pullmanwho makes great chemistry with sandrato peter gallagher rockand it is not only thatthis movie makes you heart warm and puts a smile on your face for the rest of the dayafter seeing the movie life will seem much better,happy
i love this movie sandra bullocks part is hilarious the family shes engaged to is hilarious the whole thing is great and youve got to watch ie rewind 10 times to review the part where the paperboy falls off of his bicycle which is totally unrelated to the whole thing its just a wonderful movie the plot is awesome the characters are developed well my favorite movie ever,happy
this movie is your typical chick flick where a poor woman explains why shes marrying a stranger she doesnt love by saying at least shell get a holiday and she wont be alone anymore that last bit thrown in there because women cant be alone apparently they need to marry someone even if theyre the brother of the person they love meanwhile the single bloke shes marrying is with a married woman behind her husbands back charming hard to like any of them really,happy
lucy sandra bullock lost her father a couple of years ago since her mother is also gone lucy lives alone in an apartment with her cat she works for the chicago transit system and generally feels very alone in the world one day a handsome gentleman falls on the tracks near her ticket booth a train is rapidly approaching lucy jumps onto the tracks and pulls the man to safety however he hurt his head in the fall and is in a coma rushing to the hospital to see him lucy is mistaken for his fiance and allowed into his hospital room but oh no here comes his big family including mother father sister grandma and a close neighbor they are intrigued that their relative peter never mentioned that he had become engaged but they also welcome lucy with open arms a welcome so big that lonely lucy does not have the heart to tell them she is an impostor but what will happen when peter decides to come out of his coma and when lucy meets peters brother jack is he already suspicious that she is not peters type this is a lovely lovely movie with a great cast bullock is very fine as the lonely lady although with her winning looks and personality one could never imagine her being without a bevy of friends the rest of the players including peter gallagher bill pullman peter boyle jack warden and glynis johns is an absolutely marvelous ensemble that contributes highly to the films enjoyment then too the script is quite clever and unusual the costumes are well chosen and the production values are top notch everyone who loves romantic comedies will not want to miss this one no doubt but even those who think they can not stomach a chick flick will be enchanted by this loving and very funny movie while you are awake run down to the store or library and secure this film you will go to sleep with happy dreams after any viewing,happy
this is one of the cutest most endearing and funniest movies ive seen it has the greatest mix of characters old and young all outstanding how could you go wrong with jack warden and peter boyle etc the timing on events and what the characters say is perfect it shows how real sandra bullock really is as an actress just herself without frills but naturally beautiful and funny funny bill pullman is so adorable to i hope sandra bullock makes another movie similar to this one cause she plays this type of character perfect seriously go get the movie pop it in the dvd player sit back and enjoy the ride it is good for the soul,happy
this is one of my most favorite movies having been introduced to it only last year i have fallen in love with it and have since seen it numerous times this film is a great love story while i do admit that it can be predictable this movie is so fun that it really doesnt matter the onscreen chemistry yes it does exist between bullock and pullman doesnt hurt either i personally think that this movie in its wacky and zany ways is one of the best datemoviechick flick ever made it will make you smile weather youre single married or in a relationship i highly recommend this unforgettable and truly unique love story,happy
after seeing 15 minutes of this movie i wanted to turn it off because it looked like another cheap romantic comedy but i kept watching and after i while i started liking it it wasnt a bad movie although you cant deny the fact that it is after all a pretty predictable movie even though im not really a sandra bullockfan i thought she was pretty good and perfectly suitable for this roleis a fine romantic comedy not as good as for instance nothing hill but much better as alex and emma i would say that this movie has the same level as how to lose a guy in 10 days funny entertaining predictable but acceptable610,happy
the theme to this story is simply timeless lucy bullock is a ticket attendant at the train station when suddenly her life changes her heroic act of saving peters gallagher life lead to a wholehearted acceptance into peters family by portraying herself as his fianc lucy feels so obliged to the acceptance that she is afraid to tell them that she has no affiliation to peter the rest is historythirty years from now i bet this will be a timeless classic and an inspiration for other filmmakers to be just when you think your life is meaningless you live for a new purpose as the timeless saying goes life doesnt always turn out the way you planbullock,happy
this is a very enjoyable movie from start to end even the clichd parts are cute i might be childish but i do like the message  dream men are sometimes very shallow and clueless and their less charismatic less perfect brothers or friends or neighbors are oftentimes much much more inspiring once you get to know them fortunately for girls the handsome clueless bunch usually spends a lot of time or otherwise misplacing or misdirecting their charmsthe movie relies on a silly premise that a goodnatured lie wont be discovered and when discovered it wont be ridiculed however this premise is treated fairly the viewer doesnt feel stupid as the lead character lucy has a silly idea which leads her to the silly lie so it isnt only the audience who is duped  the audience is just asked to engage in lucys silly idea and explore it as if it was just a dream and at the end its all good for real  since lucy doesnt need her silly idea anymore you feel relieved of the whole silly premisethere is plenty of chemistry between lead characters which makes the romance believablewho is this movie for best fits people in their late 20s boys might be interested if they like sandra bullock shes adorable in the movie very natural seamless,happy
this is a wonderful chick flick  sandra bullock plays a sweetheart and gives a terrific performance in this movie  this movie proves that life has a funny way of working things out for the best if we just hang in there when everything seems hopeless  i also liked the christmas setting  it makes a great movie to add to any christmas collection,happy
the guy who commented that this movie could have been written from the guys point of view meaning making the girl whod be the one in the coma well that could work but for the writers frederic lebow and daniel sullivan it took them five years to figure out that the guy should be the one in the coma and the girl the one whose identity is mistaken  i dont think it would work if it were in reverse  maybe if they make a few changes it might  two sisters instead of two brothers  what do you thinkanyway since watching this film four years ago and many times since then i try to equate every romantic comedy i watch with this film  nothing could ever surpass it in my opinion  the nearest one is only you starring robert downey jr and marisa tomei and a distant third is mrs winterbourne starring ricki lake brendan fraser and shirley maclaine  another one would be the cutting edge starring db sweeney and moira kelly  so far not even how to lose a guy in ten days maid in manhattan and even pretty woman can come close  ive yet to find the next best romantic comedyits a good thing the mr lebow and mr sullivan took five long years to write this screenplay  no wonder it became a hit because they thought about it carefullybill pullman is wonderful in this film  i would love to see him so more romantic comedies in the future  he has great comedic timing  and jason bernard who played jerry lucys supervisor was unbelievably hilarious its too bad he has already died  he was a great talent  i love the eccentric callahan family and the crazy neighbor joe fusco jr  i would love to see a sequel though thats unlikely i would love to know what has become of lucy and jack and peter and even ashleyi cant wait to see this film again  i have to buy a new copy for i have worn out minethree cheers for the romantic film ever,happy
i love this movie thats maybe cause i am a sucker for a good romantic movie this is one of the best sandra bullocks movies if you want to see a funny and romantic movie i think you should rent this one,happy
is the best movie ive ever seeni loved the story the actors everythingi thought that makes you believe that the world is not all that bad and that you are responsible for making your own dreams come true,happy
sandra bullock  someone that only a hollywood producer would envision as a lonely spinster who cant get a man  is a chicago el train ticket booth attendant with a secret crush on commuter peter gallagher when he suffers a coma after falling onto the tracks she goes to with him to the hospital and through a wacky misunderstanding his family believes that she is his fianc that he never told them about while he is in the coma she gets to know them and eventually falls for his brother played by bill pullman like sleepless in seattle this is another romantic comedy where the writers and directors confused plucky and adorable with stalkerish and insane the plot sounds like a bunnyboiler sex thriller even the title is creepy and yet this is a fluffy chick flick my girlfriend who likes this movie has admitted that the fundamental wrongness that permeates the picture is the reason for her enjoyment of this mid90s favorite but i was less enamored i would have actually preferred to have seen with michael douglas thanks kim morgan than this movie which is uncomfortable in a notfun way,happy
this is a really annoying and tedious movie from the characters to the soundtrack its so typically 90s so many moments that made me cringe in this movie that short annoying piano score which constantly plays through the movie ughthe plot is fairly original but also frustrating as it revolves the whole family who are one of the most annoying families in a movie or tv show period not knowing that one of their sons is in a coma through most of the movies runtime and is already engaged to a woman who is pretty much a mystery you dont really care about her and because of one thing overheard by a nurse but misinterpreted the character lucy played by sandra bullock has to deal with being pushed into their nuthouse the funny thing is all lucy has to do is tell them its all a big misunderstanding and we could have avoided all the frustrating stupidity that happens after why doesnt she tell them its a misunderstanding its simple because then we wouldnt have this dumb american moviealso because she doesnt bother to tell them about the misunderstanding she almost ends up marrying a guy she doesnt even know because she doesnt say anything and because of infatuation also because the dumb family push them together oh and shes also fallen for the other brother by the time the horrible and unromantic wedding comes honestly even if you were attracted to someone if you didnt know them at all would you let others keep thinking youre engaged to them because of a misunderstanding or would you think i should probably tell them whats really going on before this gets out of hand i know its just a movie but come onsandra plays her usual and typical character in this as for the side character joe jr seriously they couldnt give him a better name who also keeps trying to get lucys attention poorly i might add hey luc nice sweater thats where i facepalm he tries too hard to be cool but fails miserably as for the families annoying teen who tells the family some major news about lucy which isnt true because she doesnt get her facts straight first well shes a typical and annoying teen despite a few sweet moments this isnt a very good movie this is a movie which hasnt improved with age also a movie that shows infatuation isnt smartim not against romantic movies but at least make the script good and give me characters who dont make me want to shoot myself,happy
the movie follows lucy an offensive stereotype of an autistic woman which i can only assume was unintentional since i doubt the screenwriter has even met an autistic person at all who on top of being too pitiful to live is just a horrendous person all around she always uses his painful shyness as an excuse to just not clear up the misunderstandings especially the one that kickstarts the plot and end the movie right then and there she even goes out of her way to stalk around in the apartment of the guy shes pretending to be engaged to which only adds credence to my theory that she was written to be a terrible stereotype of an autistic woman and set disability representation back by three decades all of the other characters save for peter i suppose are terrible as well jack develops feelings for his brothers supposed fiancee without even thinking about how much this might affect him and the rest of the family pretty much just abandons peter when they find out that hed been engaged to a woman who was already married to be fair though i dont think peter couldve known she was married at that time yes this movie is so bad that i actually ended up feeling sorry for peter a character whos not supposed to be sympathetic in the slightesti will give the movie this though lucy and peter dont get married at the end honestly i think thats for the best since their entire relationship was based on a lieif you want to watch a good romcom please do not watch this offensive tripe it will make you scream and cry with rage like i did and just make you question what life is,happy
sandra bullock stars in this great love story about love at second sight sandra plays lucy a lonely woman who works at a train station for a few weeks a certain customer comes to the train station she doesnt know him or anything and they have never spoken before but lucy has fallen for him in a big way one day on christmas lucy has to work and her dream man whos called peter by the way comes in and is suddenly attacked and then falls on to the train track which leaves lucy to save him when he taken to hospital he is unconscious the whole family then seem to think that lucy is peters fianc lucy cant bare to tell them the truth so the the rest of the film follows with everyone thinking lucy is peters fianc when lucy meets jack though peters brother he doesnt think lucy is all she seems is a great and very funny film and sandra bullock is wonderful as usual i give the film a 2010,happy
ive seen numerous romantic comedies from the 30s and onward so i do have high standards i do study film and film history as a hobby i had never watched this movie until today it had high ratings and i thought i would give it a whirloh dearthis is very formulaic very predictable stuff do you really believe that someone who looks like sandra bullock and is nice to boot would be stuck with that boring job if she wanted something else would she really be alone with a cat no one dating her no close girlfriends even it is hard to believesandras character is dishonest throughout almost the entire film even if you get past that the family that takes to her under her false pretense is a vehicle for comical facial expressions and punchlines the family members do not seem like real people and the sons crisis with his dad is solved in two seconds trouble is the writer of the fatherson scene is not neil simon at the end sandra declares her love for the bill pullman character who is in love with her too he just lets her walk out of the aborted wedding service like you dont know if he will want her after she has lied to everyone of course you know in fact there is nothing surprising in this whole movie i guess i have just seen too many good romcoms clever witty edgy not totally predictable a far better romcom is sunday in new york for example another one is pillow talk i didnt find funny just trite all formula sorry,happy
while you were sleepingis a plot driven romcom whose benign complexity is its strength unlike any other feature the core is undeniably a typical textbook equation but it exfoliates the charm with one liners and hilarious humor rather than polishing it with flirty talk and when it grows intense it holds onto you until you surrender yourself feeling a plethora of emotions where the primary one is satisfaction the chemistry is the ace in the hole in such genre which it delivers unflinchingly in here but its not among the lead characters that are at their best but side ones bullock and warden are the perfect sensible teammates you will ever get on screen whilst bullocks bittersweet relationship with rispoli is the highlight of the feature the narrative has a mockery tone that draws out the laugh from its uncertainty and unexpected outcomes from each character the screenplay by sullivan and lebow is gripping adaptive and sensible if not layered or thought provoking as the makers might suggest it is shot beautifully with a true christmas spirited theme that is pleasingly light and breezy to encounter but is unfortunately short on technical aspects like cinematography background score and editing bullock as always delivers to the full with the help of a decent supporting cast like boyle warden and rispoli the ironic humor a sense of urgency and a good old romantic tale are the high points of the feature the director turteltaub is honest to its characters and storyline where he neither overchews it nor leaves it undercooked is surprisingly a very smart feature on terms of the finesse on weaving the structure with every bit of husky material it could scrape off from its characters and their subplots,happy
while you were sleepingthe best time to pull the plug on a coma patient is right before their medical insurance runs outfortunately the vegetable in this romanticcomedy has an excellent health benefits packagefeigning an affiliation with a comatose passenger peter peter gallagher who was attacked on the l train transit employee lucy sandra bullock maintains this pretext when his family peter boyle monica keena glynis johns arrives at the hospitalhowever her scheme goes awry when she starts falling for peters younger brother jack bill pullman things get even more complicated when peter wakes up and doesnt recognize her as his fiancewhile its plot is highly unorthodox  bordering on creepy  and its starryeyed clichs are palpable bullocks girlnextdoor demeanor does manage to transform this stalkeresque love story into a charming little romcom about excessive lyingincidentally to payoff medical expenses coma victims can always moonlight as mattress store mannequinsyellow lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,happy
i like sandra bullock and bill pullman and pretty much all of the members of the cast it was especially nice to see jack warden and glynis johns again the films family interactions were amusingthe picture is supposed to be a romanticcomedyfairytale type film and i suppose it is that but i found it hard to accept the gorgeous vivacious sandra bullock as a lonely familyless waif alone in the city with only a cat and an annoying stalkersonofthelandlord as company are there no at least moderately homely actresses in hollywood to play homely characters  that said the story if implausible is a way to pass part of an afternoon if you like this sort of film go for it its ok,happy
lucy sandra bullock is a train token taker without a family she pines for frequent commuter peter peter gallagher but never speaks to him then on christmas peter gets pushed off the platform and she rescues him in the hospital the family mistakes her for his fiance while hes in a coma she and his brother jack bill pullman slowly falls for each otherthis is a perfectly harmless sandra bullock romcom and shes so great at it she can make any preposterous situations work this movie is about bullocks vulnerable charm the biggest problem is that bill pullman doesnt get in the movie until almost 30 minutes in they need more time together to develop the chemistry i dont know why he doesnt get in right from the start,happy
thanks daffy for this nearly quote from one of your best cartoon you were duckier because it resumes well this movie how after rescuing a man sandra is drowned under a flood of misunderstandings and little lyings that lead her to marry him and all that while he is in coma i thought that this movie would be a disaster because the cover looks cheap and on the contrary its as good as a christmas gift it has everything i like winter holidays chicago more and more present in my movies and really a great town behind nyc and well ahead of la cats a funny brunette the inlaw relationships and the pain from lonelinessthe writers found a very original and funny idea and manage to sustain the drama and the comedy without stop unfortunately they dont write anything else after maybe they fall also in coma and get married ,happy
is an absolutely superb movie not since when harry met sally has there been a movie that has been this funny romantic and brilliantafter watching it in the cinema i knew that i had to have it on video the dialogue is witty sandra and bill are sooooo sweet together and the best thing is that even after watching it over and over again you dont get bored of ita great movie to watch with those you love  it makes you think about family  and especially good during holidays or when you are feeling down a rags to riches story that you just cant miss its sure to win your heart as it did mine,happy
wyws is not a bad film sandra bullock and bill pullman are competent enough to believe however i think this film is showing its age even though it was made in 1995 and there are simply better films in the genre out there want my opinion watch keeping the faith instead brilliant acting much funnier but at the same time touching and real that film does everything much better than while you were sleeping,happy
the story  line might be mushy to some  i really like this movie as the setting is so simple but the story delivered  excellently this story seems to touch me as sandra bullock is not cast in typical role such as lawyers or etc but someone who we can meet everydaythe relationship between lucy and jack is shown how it was developed slowly and become  love to both of them i was not attracted  to watch this movie when it was first released in year 1995 but i had nothing to do so i borrowed my friends tape and i was stuck the next day i repeated watching the movie and last year i just bought the vcd version and i think that i might be continuing watching it even though i had watch it for more than 10 times,happy
what else can i say i love sandra bullock she could make an hour and a half long video of herself trying on different outfits and i would buy it in a heartbeat is sandra at her sweetest and loveliest it has become one of my favorite christmas movies i didnt care for bill pullman in his roll as the brotherlove interest pullman makes a great clown as in ruthless people but should leave more serious roles alone i think its that silly toothless grin of his he comes off too uptight the hardest thing to believe about this movie is that sandra wouldnt have anyone in her life i could maybe imagine her working in a token booth ive known other attractive women in real life who take on jobs that might be considered beneath them she explains in the movie that she had to drop out of school when her father got sick and go to work for the transit authority it just makes her more human and obtainable which i find irresistible,happy
excessive use of sweetness and cuteness has destroyed a romantic comedy many times sometimes this genre needs those elements to work when director and writer can dose just right amount of sweetness and cuteness they call it sense of style 1995 directed by jon turteltaubin is good example of successful dosement pinch more and the soup would be spoilt charismatic and sympatic but wrong kind of characters often choosing sandra bullock plays this time in a suitable role as a metro ticketseller job isnt very interesting all day long sitting in a small booth and getting cold the ticketseller is little crushed on some handsome regular customer peter callagher who one day gets hurt crooks attacks at him on a platform takes the money and throws the man on the railsfortunately the ticketseller sees that and saves the man when train is almost colliding with him the man goes to a hospital where doctors tell that hes in a coma patients family arrives to the hospital and assume that the ticketseller is mans girlfriend the woman doesnt deny the misunderstanding and that way she gets to know the patients brother jack bill pullmanof  course here i could be cynical and ask why on earth the woman doesnt fix the misunderstanding when it would demand only one sentence of course because then the plot would be messed up the coma lasts exactly as long as the plot demands but this is a movie to this genre it is supposed to watch through the fingers and forgive the holes of the plotsandra bullock and her character which she plays are so lovely that you would not want to make bad faces to them that is the reason why works when you care about the people of the movie you care about the movie it doesnt matter if the plot cant take closer observating bill pullman is the the right partner for bullock,happy
this is such a good movie on so many levels that you cant help but fall in love with it  came out a little after sleepless in seattle but holds onto the same oldfashioned story of love romance and starry nights while mixing them with sentiment smiles and big laughs  and there are lots of all of these qualities heresandra bullock  ahh is there any redblooded american man who can help but fall for her  shes beautiful and strongwilled and just as confused about love as the rest of us  here she plays lucy a single subway attendant whose only wish is to see the world and to catch the attention of a handsome man gallagher she takes a subway token from each every morningthen in circumstances too myriad to get into he falls into a coma and everyone including his family believes lucy is his fiancee  then her lonely life is changed forever by her adopted family and by the vegetables brother pullman who suspects something fishy is going on but doesnt let that get in the way of his feeling strongly for lucy toothe whole cast is strong right down the line including boyle warden johns bernard rispoli who is hilarious and even walker as gallaghers exgirlfriend who expected this kind of comedienne in tvs the profileras far as its comparisons to sleepless its justified to be sure but for comedy quotient is the obvious winner  just watch when gallagher comes out of his coma to see misunderstanding brought into a whole realm of comedic bravura all its ownof course true love wins out in the end and all is well with the world  as if there were any doubt  and bullock becomes the love of every moviegoing males lifenine stars for for the incurable romantic in all of us who also likes a good laugh once in a while,happy
this is the best romantic movie i have ever seen watch it to raise your spirits when you feel down and out a very clean movie bill pullman and sandra bullock make a great pair,happy
i found this movie very very fun to watch one of the main reason might be the casting every cast in this movie was simply great awesome sure its ending is predictable like almost any other hollywood romantic movie but the acting made this movie more believable and sandra bullock is just amazing i think this is her best acting that i ever saw way to go,happy
i just saw this movie again and i still love it sure its ending is predictable like almost any other hollywood romantic movie and the callagher family is a little too idyllic but thats where any similarities to other movies in this genre cease in themselves all of the characters are believable and fun and the chemistry between sandra bullock and bill pullman is unique michael rispolis performance is also commendable he manages to make the joe jr character very funny and at the same time lovable there are countless scenes in this movie that makes it suitable to be seen over and over again the plot the lines the atmosphere its a feel good movie and i give this movie my best recommendations,happy
i totally love this movie the chemistry between bill pullman my favorite actor and sandra bullock is very believable one thing i truly loved about this movie is that every character had a funny line it was nice seeing a movie where every character has a sense of humor that seems to be pretty rare these days in the movies this is my favorite bill pullman movie with the next best of his being zero effect he is so great as jack callaghan also one of my favorite characters is joe jr he is priceless great job michael rispoli i could watch this movie over and over and it gets better each and every time this is one movie you can watch in front of children without being afraid of them seeinghearing suggestive content maybe 2 things maximum great film,happy
everyone in this movie was perfectly cast i loved the oneliners of lucys boss youre cheating on a vegetable the goofiness of joe jr i love black underwears the delightful music but the secret love of lucy and jack tops them all especially when he drives her home after peter wakes up when he gives her the snow globe to when she admits that she loves jack and the happy ending the chemistry of sandra bullock and bill pullman rivals that of tom hanks and meg ryan excellent movie,happy
i did like this film despite it being the most obvious example of a chick flick known to man it is both original and very funny as well as the fact it has the gorgeous sandra bullock in the lead she plays lucy a lonely ticket sales girl at a railway station who falls for a passenger she has never met one day she witnesses him being mugged and while he is lying unconscious she alerts the emergency services and is somehow mistaken as his fiance his family get involved and she still plays along with the lie that is until his brother bill pullman becomes a little suspicious sounds sickly sweet well maybe it is a little but bullocks irresistible girl next door appeal makes it work,happy
i thought that this film was absolutely great  watching it makes me feel that the world isnt such a bad place  i think that sandra bullock is wonderful as is bill pullman  the ending was a little predictable but i dont care  i think it is great because it makes me feel good about myself when i have watched it,happy
this is one of the best romantic comedies that i have seen in years the plot is lively funny and original sandra bullock and bill pullman are witty vulnerable and charming while the plot is sweetly romantic i recommend it highly add this to any home video library,happy
first off i cant believe that it has taken me so long to write something about this film since it is easily my favourite romantic comedy of alltime and one of the best films of any genre that i have ever seen  i dont think that ive ever seen a film that i have liked so quickly and totally  i mean this film had me smiling less than a minute in and i dont think that the smile ever left my face for the remainder of the picture  i just found everything about this film to be completely irresistible especially the devastatingly charming performance by sandra bullock  in all fairness the entire cast is great but this is bullocks film and no one else could have possibly done as great a job as she did this film is undeniably formulaic and predictable and yet i loved it anyway,happy
i had a quite low expectation because1i didnt like harry met sally sleepless in seattle very much2the title really put me off but this film was great setting actorsstorymusic everything seems so natural and warm and small roles like lucys boss and joe jr shines even peters fiancee didnt annoy me what can i ask more there are some filmgood or bad doesnt matter which made people boundlessly generous loyal obsessive maybe towards them it is the one of mine definitely this is one not to miss  you will probably like it,happy
this movie was perfectly cast from lucy to the grandmother to the hot dog vendor it couldnt have been done any better this is a must see great for couples,happy
the casting director for this film deserves a medal every single actor in it is perfect  who could imagine a better handsome clueless rich guy than peter gallagher or his equally handsome and very sexy brother bill pullman and americas sweetheart sandra bullock in her finest moment so far makes every line believable even that falling on ice bit everyone in the supporting cast is great and memorable the shots of chicago are incredibleits quite possibly my favorite chicago movie true love of course conquers all all right everybody swoon,happy
i love romantic comedies and this was one of the best ive ever  seenfull credit for the performers cast  crew stunning bill and sandra and peter callaghan  a must notwithstandingi became a little frustrated with what i think was an abrupt ending i would like to know more about peter the sleepy brother and his reaction to the loss of the bride to be i suggest another film based on this wyws plot or even tv series why not,happy
even though i wouldnt call it the best movie ever i must admit i was pretty impressed by the performances of bill pullman and sandra bullock they really convinced that there was a spark between them something which is absent in a lot of other movies great fun must see ,happy

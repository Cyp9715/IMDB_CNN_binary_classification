this movie has been regarded as the cream of hong kong gangster and cop movie and has won 22 awards but we all know awards dont mean a thing sometimes the god father of america cinema martin scorsese himself is making a american version of the movie titled departed im somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master but distraught to the possibility of disappointmenta little history of hong kong film industry being in somewhat government free state for over 100 years hong kong movie industry proliferated to the state of hysteria on one hand everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth on the other hand lack of political drama has afforded the gangster and cop drama to truly grow and maturenow back to the movie itself 3 years ago when i was still a poor student i was loitering in the local chinese video store as usual looking for something exciting the owner handed me a vhs copy of this movie he personally recommended it and said its new and unique so i went home and watched it immediately and then i said in my then dark and dingy apartment for 30 minutes in utter silencethere was no plot twist and no surprise ending no mr m nights heavy handed gimmicks and hollywoods camera tricks but from the beginning to the end for full 2 hours you can cut the tension with a knife in the end you still dont want it to end the story goes on in your mind questions bits and pieces start to put together characters start to take shape even after the movie endedin my entire life ive never seen a movie that there isnt a single excessive frame until i saw this movie it has forever changed my expectation on crime dramathe story is genius and simple enough a mole in police department working against an undercover cop in drug trafficking mafia they dont know each others identity so it is like a invisible tug war between the two competing against each others wits i wont reveal too much of it even though like i said theres no plot twistits a fairly popular movie that has generated huge buzz when it came out and since been talked compared and still highly regarded as unsurpassed by countless fans worldwide it has an all star cast in hong kong cinema and of course the screenplay the acting the editing the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standardsif you are adventurous enough to try even one hong kong movie try this one,intelligence
most western viewers will only know the asian crime scene from the bleak and lyrical canvas of takeshi kitanos work here we get something that at first seems far more westernized and very close to the work of one michael mann okay enough allusions yes heat comes heavily to mind at first but this is no simple heat in hong kong this a splicing of everything asians do best in a moody stylish tensionbased thriller from the beautiful cinematographyreminiscent of wong karways films step forward visual consultant christopher doyle  and music to the graceful yingyang undertones mirrorimages are a key theme the films most heroic achievement lies in its leads and in the bold endinghearing that this is being considered for a remake stateside comes as no big surprise but how matt damon and leonardo dicaprio could possibly compete against andy lau and tony leung evokes cynicism at best both leads are perfect laus cold calculating intellect against leungs anguished and tormented heart complimentary opposites there arent enough words to commend this fresh invigorating film with,intelligence
this movie should be compared to movie like heat even when the storyline are not the same movies like hardboiled and a better tomorrow are predominately actionbased whereas this movie is more dramatic and emotionallydriventhe main attraction is the mole hunts but it would not be as brilliantly done if not for the fireworks between the major charactersthe title from the explanation in the intro means endless purgatory road this philosophy to me really made this movie more thoughtful the two central characters both had to walk their road in life and in their minds for a long time both had no choice but to keep walking as they cross path they were forced to play the game of cat and mouse by their superiors while it is not certain whos the cat and whos the mouse one thing is certain  the loser will diewhile there are four main characters they are all males this should be bad for any movie but i think this is one of the exception to the rule the emotions and tension between the four were wellscripted and brilliantly played it is no surprised each had at least one best actor awards in the hong kong industry the sequels2 prequels will delve deeper into itplotwise  it is hard to see any holesseen it around six times a lot for a dramai think you should ask yourself after the movie what would i do if i am in the same situation right and wrong is harder to separate,intelligence
this movie is wellmade stylish and extremely entertaining however as stated by the review from a hong kong viewer there is also depth and subtlety rarely found in actionthrillers it is this depth that makes this movie brilliant the depth of this movie is best served by the understated yet deeply moving performances of the main characters viewers are allowed into the inner changes of these characters and before long the viewers begin to care about them be it the good guy yan or the bad guy ming the rest of cast successfully relate the complicated and exciting plot to the viewers and all the supporting performances are almost flawless perhaps with the exception of the female psychologist who seems sadly onedimensional i grew up in hong kong but has since lived most of my life in canada with this duocultural background i have mixed feelings about the hollywood remaking of this movie on the one hand i am happy for the hollywood recognition of this great movie by remaking it on the other hand i would hate to see how badly sabotaged the end result would be some things just do not translate as a minimum i hope the great director scorcese will make good use of the major plot line and generate a haute thriller and with the excellent cast develop some indepth characterization the chinese philosophy and the spirit of the original film is better left undisturbed,intelligence
a seriously refreshing police thriller that cranks up the tension to the max theres no overblown gunplay or buddy cop crap here this baby is tight as a drum and will have your nails down to the quick superb performances a tight script and tense direction make this a winner in every department pick it up if you can its fantastic910niz,intelligence
as cadets lau and chan both show promise as police officers  however chan is removed from the training and send to be a longterm undercover in sams gang  however unbeknownst to the police lau is also a longterm mole who is feeding information back to sam  when sam and police chief sp wong both have their operations scuppered each realises the other has a mole and sets out to uncover each  with each others lives at risk lau and chan must be the first to uncover the otheri decided to see this after hearing good things about it but i was conscious that often foreign films can be given more leniency than western films doing the same thing  after a slightly confusing opening few moments as characters settle down not helped by using completely different actors for characters at late teens and late 20s  do people change that much the film immediately becomes gripping  the plot may well have the occasional hole and have unnecessary personal details laus girlfriend and chans ex werent really needed but the central story is well written and told with such urgency that it is hard not to be totally engagedthe film doesnt have many massive shoot outs or action scenes but it has a pretty consistent sense of tension that is enjoyable right up to a typical but impacting ending  the direction is stylish and only occasionally overuses the slowmo jump cuts  it may owe more to american cinema than that of the orient but it is still a very good film and i hope the inevitable remake will be as goodthe cast dont need to do that much apart from look intense and portray the tension of the story in a realistic fashion  something that they do well at times the lead two actors are pushed out of this by the personal asides but they happily keep things on track  both lau and leung play it very well  it never came down to good guybad guy and the audience was pretty well split  wong is a solid officer while tsang is good as sam  chen and cheng may not have a great deal to do apart from slowing the film but they both look good doing itoverall this is a solidly enjoyable cop thriller regardless of what country it comes from  it will eventually be remade i imagine and when it is i hope that it manages to retain its consistent sense of tension doubleedged characters and a real tight hold on its audience just as this did here,intelligence
i looked over a squad of reviews and was sad not to see anyone writing from hong kong so i am putting in my piecehong kong movies have changed a lot in the last decade and when came out it was a real change i noted golden chicken was mentioned earlier and that sums up many of the lame comedies that have recently been churned out however the comedy is a large part of hong kong cinema as is the gangster genre breaks with the comedy keeps the gangsters lau being a first class clean cut one  whilst leung acts a remarkable strained police officer and adds clever and intelligent tension the acting is first class as is the mood that truly captures the zeitgeistthis movie is about the two characters and their similarities and moral obstacles it also has something subtle to saythis film was huge news in hong kong and the mainland it is an important hong kong film the us remake will be more clichd than you can imagine this film will translate it is not that original no but it has substance and mood that is valuablesee it,intelligence
after i enjoyed martin scorceses the departed i decided to watch the film that inspired the celebrated director to remake it and move the action from hong kong to boston ma usa i must say that i liked the original movie better 50 minutes shorter than scorceses magnificent remake is tighter faster more compelling and tells the same story better it does not have a grand acting jack nicholson who basically plays daryl van horne with the attitude and characters dont talk and dont curse as much as they do in the departed but the hong kongs movie only benefits from it as much as i admire leonardo dicaprio as bill castigan tony leung yan in his role is simply unforgettable,intelligence
im late in discovering the hong kong crime thriller genre so i can only compare mou gaan dou to its hollywood compatriots it grippingly is the equal of such intense examinations of the anguish of undercover cops as donnie brascoe or dirty cops such as narc or training day key is the dynamic opposite pairing of two leonine charismatic actors tony leung chiu wai the selfsacrificing heart throb from hero ying xiong and the languid lover from in the mood for love fa yeung nin wa here as an antsy anguished too long undercover cop versus andy lau as his crisply efficient ambitious counterpart the plot propelled as well by the music unpredictably twists and takes hairpin turns from the beginning so that even with helpful flashbacks its a thrilling roller coaster ride to try to follow the constantly changing loyalties manipulations deals and revelations not unlike the tv series the wire regardless you get that the real battle is for the characters souls as much as their lives and you hold your breath to the last surprising minute the initial motivations for how the men came to be at this crossroads will doubtless be explored in the prequel and sequel that havent been released in the us yet the women are just the girlfriends but they do have separate lives jobs and choices that impact the men in their lives with noted cinematographer christopher doyle is listed as a visual consultant in the credits the great bulk of the film takes place at night like a comparable chase film collateral so it was unfortunate that the print i saw was not pristine it was also annoying that the subtitles were white on white illegible and that ideograms that are shown in the scene are not translated even when the camera rests on them for a length of time that makes one assume something significant is written there,intelligence
a deceptively simple idea lies at the heart of this complex thriller the hong kong police and a triad gang both have an informer in each others organisation whoevers man picks the enemies spy first wins the game for his side add to that the customary doubleagentdoesntknowwhichsideheisonanymore subplot doubled of course and you have plenty of ingredients for a plot although its to the movies credit that although a little stylised it never seems false or contrived fastpaced and bold with a generous score it never insults the viewers intelligence either and features just the right level of moral ambiguity at one level its just another thriller and theres little in the way of wider political or social subtext but on the other hand its a textbook lesson in the art of making this sort of film,intelligence
ones an undercover cop inside a triad the other is a undercover triad inside the police force  which one will expose the other first  riveting drama throughout included in the package is a topnotch cast at the peak of their powers and expert direction  did i mention this is also an allegory for a buddhist hell  if you dont know what hell is just take a look at the surviving character at the end of the movie and youll have a fairly good concept just when you think a genre has been done to death something like this takes you by surprise  this is a must see film for anyone interested in delving much deeper than standard cop versus crook fair,intelligence
910a brilliant cop movie out of hong kong with a sublime plot and great acting by the two leads andy lau and tony leung an indescribably great actor an amazing concept with lau as an undercover triad member in the police force and leung as an undercover cop in the triad which leads to many interesting situations great stuff and the dvd even has the alternative ending which isnt nearly as good as the main one,intelligence
i ran across this movie some time ago on netflix and the description intrigued me while i am not always one for subtitled films i did not find it to be a distraction with his movie because the plot captivated meas many of you are aware this movie was remade by hollywood and released in 2006 under the name the departed where it has been treated by the media as such a fabulous and innovative storyline none of them bothered to discover that the departed was a remake of this moviehappily some of the classic lines such as chopping one up and feeding him to the poor survived the hollywood chopping block but the fabulous method of communicating secretly via morse code did not make the transition from hong kong to hollywoodmy suggestion if you loved this original then do not disappoint yourself watching the hollywood remake,intelligence
mou gaan dou us title has one of the best scripts ever of the contemporary cinema the actors the director are great yes but all the power this movie has is in the scriptthe script is as realistic as a movie can be there is no realistic movie it has flaws because there is no perfect script either but all the great things in it overwhelmed the flawstwo main characters is all you need to create a great movie you dont need to write the classic clichs to make the movie work you just have to feel what they feel if you can do that your movie will be perfectyan is a troubled man working as undercover for 10 years he became crazy anybody should up to the point when he becomes paranoiac he has nothing to loose because he has no identity he hates his job in one word he is desperate to get his life back be somebody again ming on the other hand has got everything since he did things straight he became troubled because he friends with all his partners he moves in with his girl he now has something loose and he knows that if his cover is blow he will loose everything he doesnt want to be a nobody againthe script is how the environment where we live and the people we are surrounded changes us up to the point where we become different people that we once werethe film is great mainly because of his script and the reason i hate the american remake the departed is because william monahan took away everything beautiful the original script had and turned it into a caction movie full of hollywood clichs,intelligence
a slick intelligent thriller which seems to be a mixture of both the godfather and heat  yet manages to be tighter and more intense than the two both lead roles are suitably underplayed allowing the stress and tension of the respective moles jobs to show itself without resorting to pacinolike over acting indeed much of the film is told in dialogue there are no ridiculous action sequences and the final rooftop confrontation is both incredibly intense and masterful in keeping such a sprawling tale enclosed in such a small yet fitting finale it has been followed by two equally wonderful films but the original remains both a sophisticated piece of modern cinema and a dizzyingly exciting thriller,intelligence
this movie is packed with heart pacing action and suspense my favorite of all time if you just read the premisestoryline of the movie it will give you tingles didnt yawn once if you like action movies and even if you dont you will love it the movie contains some of the hottest actors in asia and the acting is superb the beginning is sort of confusing but the rest of the movie is excellently put together and is in perfect sync leading to the climax the depth of the movie is amazing and is true to the story line theres great rising action and falling action i really dont think action movies and get any better than this the greatest 101 minutes of my life,intelligence
this is an incredibly sad movieits because it is pretty good its tight its completely coherent the narrative veers in odd directions just before you expect it to the pacing is just right for a mainstream picturewhats sad in watching it is knowing scorcesess remake something that follows this very closely people seem to like the fact that its sparkly in terms of the characters it was almost tolerable for me when i watched it but seeing how this roots the story and how scorceses blind spot kills him its enough to make you worry even cry for the state of cinemascorceses a good man he loves cinema and the world is far better off for him in it just on his preservation efforts and promotion of film as a sort of art but his curse is that he is locked in an italian mind he has only one way of telling a story in his world all creation flows from individuals those individuals bend the universe if you understand their motives you understand how the world works at least the world you experience in the filmactors think they love this because it empowers them but it also gives them no support no cosmos in which to exist they have to carry the entire narrative burden on themselves thats why you have such colorful characters thugs and such and its why you need such extreme and un nuanced actors who can only bulldoze through hes been doing it long enough that he knows how to make it workbut then you see this its eight dimensions more full yes it is less loud less aggressive in terms of personal projection but it works at such a deeper level that one wonders why we even tolerate scorcese and his friends in this film the filmmaker and writer have created a world two worlds actually these two worlds interact but largely stay statically opposed as with ordinary noir a simple soul finds himself caught up in the dynamics of the world he is in mostly hapless in terms of what happens he can only respond how he responds is what makes the narrativethe trick in this story is that there are two worlds and people from each caught in the other so the tension between the two worlds can be dramatized as the tension between two men and their sponsors not as bombast but as human honor and survival mean something because there is a context not just an assertionin this story some men dont survive they are the scorsese typesteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,intelligence
id say the most amazing thing about is that it shows that hollywoods greatest accomplishment is not its ability to make truly terrible movies no hollywoods greatest accomplishment is its ability to take a great movie and remake it into something infernally inferior if you havent seen either of these films ignore the departed and watch after you watch continue to ignore the departed in ia the story is tighter there are no wasted or superfluous scenes seemingly thrown in to give the topbilled some extra facetime the romantic appendage is simpler and actually logical unlike the hackjob in the departed and the ending is better what more could you ask for oh yeah there is more  no nicholson overacting no bad boston accents and the cops dont all act stupid all the time,intelligence
i bought this film on dvd by pure chance and i am so pleased that i did the films brilliance is in making you care about both of the main characters to the point you want them both win even though you know only one can certain scenes actually made me sit up and i found myself watching it again almost straight away only ever done that with dead mans shoes which is also excellent this is definitely in my top 5 of all time number 2 is nearly as good but it is a totally different kind of film it is a much more expansive and ambitious film adding to the first wonderfully with out really needing to have seen the original the third in the series is just plain confusing with no story left to tell and jumping between two time lines presumably to shoe horn in tony leung,intelligence
there is something very invigurating about asian cinema i think it has to do with the free reign the film makers are given unlike hollywood they really dont have to adhere to focus groups or near sighted hollywood suits they are able to take their stories to places that we as north american viewers are not fully accustomed to is a film that emphasizes this point i realize that it has been optioned by a group led by brad pitt in the hopes that it will be developed into a big budget hollywood flick if they succeed i really do hope they remain true to the source material because this is one beautifully resonate filmfirst of all i must admit that it took a little bit to get used to especailly the kind of karaoke feel some scenes have but as the story played out the more involved i became i was truly routing for both of these guys and hoped that some way everything would work out probably the main thing that kept me glued to the screen was the performances of the two leads especially andy lau i am not too familiar with his work you know i have just recently been introduced to asian filmsthanks to aint it cool news for pointing this one out along with sympathy for mr vengeance he is amazing his face alone can hold a scene fantastic actori am not going to go into details about the plot but like i said some scenes are kind of done like bad karoake but they are few and far between what struck me the most was that it didnt really dumb down the plot not everything was fully explained except maybe a last moment of reflection that was not really necessary the film makers really assumed that we as the audience were smart enough to figure some stuff out on our own i was also amazed at the lack of violence and lack of strong language i mean dont get me wrong this is an intense flick but it didnt need to resort to that kind of thing to get the viewer involved i found that pretty interesting i am not sure if the cultural differences had anything to do with influencing my opinion meaning that i am not familiar with police laws in hong kong or the relationship the triads have with the police and so on i just took everything at face value and it all seemed plausible to me but again what do i knowanyway aside from an occasional oddity and my own ignorance this is one refreshing film smart intense and beautifully acted thank god for torontos china town or else i would never be able to see this film unless it starred brad pitt and edward norton,intelligence
with all the hype surrounding this film in hong kong expectations were always going to be so high when you also include the biggest names around in hk showbiz into the cast  andy lau tony leung sammi cheng kelly chen edison chen shawn yue and elva hsiao all have iconic popstar status with huge followings  youd expect either an explosive story or sheer disappointment nothing in between fortunately it is the former category and how well did they do it at thattells of two top police cadets who choose or are forced to choose to follow different paths inspector lau andy lau is recruited by a triad leader sam eric tsang to infiltrate the police force and act as a mole meanwhile yan tony leung appears to have been kicked out of police academy but has been secretly been recruited to act as a mole in sams gang suddenly both come under the pressure each organisation suspects a mole but can they keep themselves under coverwith three of my favourite actors headlining this film i was hopeful for some quality performances andy lau turns in a brilliant performance on a level with a fighters blues aka ah fu its emotional and gritty and indeed very human not much to say about tony leung other than he produces everything that we expect of this veteran actor eric tsang plays the boss convincingly  ok i have to admit it is hard to pinpoint where the quality of their performances is for each of them but thats the socalled xfactor and theyve got tonnes of itas for the remainder of the cast they are fairly short cameos but it is nice to see sammi cheng in a role removed from her traditional romcom roles kelly edison shawn and elvas roles were really too short to comment onbut take away these stars and you see the underlying plot and script were simply excellent there was drama and intensity keeping your adrenaline pumping action scenes werent innovative but fit in nicely with the film and theres plenty of subtext emotion roller coaster rides and beautiful scenery they love their rooftops to addwas the highest grossing movie in hong kong according to the mpia which is not bad for an industry that is suffering from imports to hong kong and it certainly deserves that award because it is probably the best hk film ive seen in a very long timeone to watch over and over againdvd review media asia have released an alternate endings version of in hong kong please note that without spoiling it the second ending is much shorter than the first so please dont be disappointed guess thats why they put the first one in the real version the extras are on a second disc and are packed with lots of additional bits but most of them do not carry subtitles nonetheless a worthwhile buy i think,intelligence
a gripping intense ride is played out between chan wing yan played by tony leung chiu wai and lau kin ming played by andy lau tak wah i was just amazed on how good this movie was and after watching it i felt the review written in the user comments on the main page was completely unfair andy lau tony leung anthony wong and eric tsang all give excellent performances with tony leungs tortured undercover cop character completely owning the film andy laus role is not played out to its full potential but sammi chengs extended cameo as mings girlfriend brings depth and reason to his turn as the triad mole who wants to be good anthony wong is calm and eric tsang is charismatic as the two men controlling the two moles these two supporting characters are pivotal as their actions explain the two main characters prime motivations for wanting to be goodbad ive heard that the us remake has dropped these two characters from the departed which is a shame however one hopes that with scorsese at the helm the film can only get better even though gangs of new york was horriblethis movie is a must watch for people whove followed triad movies in hong kong and is at least worth a rental for those who dont get this movie perhaps you should rent ii which is the prequel of done in godfatherlike fashion,intelligence
wowthat is all i can say about this movie i was really impressed internal affairs have become my favorite film i was surprised by the ending and did not expect it at all there are so many heartfelt moments in the film but i dont want to ruined it by telling the scenes for people who are going to watch the film and have not seen it yet i highly recommended internal affairs for a smart sexy intelligent action film best movie in a long time one thing i will tell you about this film since imdb wants 10 linesgod how annoying and nitpicky you will grow to love the characters i was shocked when inspector wong died i was shocked and sad when undercover cop yan died in the end and i absolutely hated the triad mole ming that he got away with being so evil and fraud,intelligence
wow  this movie became one of my favorites since i saw it its a drama based on two twisted characters with a nearly perfect story there arent down times neither bad actors well if i keep talking about the movie i might not end but its a mustsee for hongkong lovers like me the music is excellent and tony leung is as perfect as it could be every shot of this movie is well done every actor does know to play oh my god putting andy lau anthony wong eric tsang edison chen shawn yue  tony leung is just making the dream team  the final scene left me speechless i was nearly crying i hope you people will still watch it and the second  third part of this story is a trilogy lets hope scorsese wont waste the charm of this movie with his remake,intelligence
wow  thats what i call a very good thriller  the movie is very solid and well balanced the music is simple yet wonderful and goes totally with the rhythm of the movie  unlike the departed where the music is loud awful and plays exactly in the wrong timethere are some strong memorable lines here and there unlike in the departed where you hear a lot of noise but nothing really sticks in your mindthis movie has the necessary depth that the departed is lacking  the departed is shallow gore and violentthe excitement in this masterpiece is very high and makes sensewhat ever i say doesnt do this masterpiece justice  i can go on and one but im afraid to spoil the movie in short skip hollywoods junk and watch this masterpiece which is way better than the departed  enjoy it,intelligence
its a sentiment that has been echoed many times since the release of martin scorceses the departed but its worth saying once more without internal affairs the departed would not exist the film is not without its flawsit is at times hokey and lapses between scenes derail the continuity at points but the intriguing premise vivid characters slick visuals and breakneck pacing come together to produce a film that isnt only fun to watch but substantive it would be unfair to place scorceses remake on the pedestal it stands to occupy without acknowledging this filmthis isnt nicholson damon and dicaprio but the acting is no less compelling tony leung ragged and feral is a stark contrast to his adversary played capably by andy lau who traverses dangerous ground as a triad packaged as a charming and talented detective eric tsang and anthony wong both turn in performances that buttress the theme of dichotomy as two weathered veterans engaged in a human chess match with the lives of their protges at stakethe story revolves around a wouldbe officer played by leung a former academy standout handpicked to infiltrate the triads for an indefinite amount of time simultaneously the triads send a young solider to establish a vein of intelligence within the police department both men quickly rise in their respective agencies enmeshing themselves in the operations finding it increasingly difficult to see the way out and as years pass increasingly difficult to separate reality from the lives that theyve built on a foundation of deceit their paths come to a head when those who commissioned them inform them that they each man must identify and expose the other all while avoiding being discovered by their ownthematically the film showcases the delicate interplay between truth and deceit safety and death crime and justice that subtly manifests itself in the fabric of this film and never wavers masterfully crafted tension is broken up in parts by comic moments that are as fleeting as any sense of security afforded its protagonistthe most important aspect of this film the notion that the two leads are reflections of one another that every man has a propensity for good and evil that dilemmas of justice like morality have no easy solutions is not new by any means but here it is treated in a manner that is neither stale nor heavy handed the two lead characters are as connected as they are opposed something which is explored here to a greater degree here than in the scorcese remakealthough the departed borrows much from this film it does not achieve the level of cohesion or the richness of connection between its characters thats not to say that scorceses film is a failure its an entertaining film with viable themes and though this came first the westernized version is still worth watching even if only for the star powered cast for a taste of scorceses signature gangster lean or for alec baldwins scene stealing banter after reading so many responses to the film on this site its clear that some of the credit for its warm reception is due to the film being set in the city of boston but for whatever reason this story just seems more at home in the alternately murky and glowing streets of hong kong,intelligence
martin scorseses the departed was probably one of the most criticallyacclaimed films of 2006 and upon hearing the tumult of praise that accompanied its release it was a film that i desperately wanted to see however i couldnt do so until i had seen the 2002 hong kong film upon which it was based mou gaan dou directed by waikeung lau and siu fai mak fortunately not too long ago my local movie rental store was having a sale on their superfluous vhs tapes at a price of 200 apiece among the cheap movies that i snapped up was a copy of that looked like it had never been opened having now watched it i must say that despite my limited experience with asian cinema i very much enjoyed the film combines an irresistible story of intrigue loyalty and betrayal with some extremely slick editing and camerawork its no surprise that the film has acquired an impressive following in the westtony leung plays chan wing yan an overwrought undercover cop who has spent the last ten years infiltrating numerous dangerous gangs and exposing their criminal dealings on the opposite end of the spectrum andy lau plays inspector lau kin ming a police mole who is secretly working the triad the same gang with which yan is currently affiliated after an expensive drugs transaction goes wrong for both the gang and the police force each side suspects that they have a traitor in their midst and in a bitterly ironic turn it falls to each of the two moles to find out who it is both main actors do a good job of maintaining the intensity of the story there are certainly countless parallels to be drawn between the characters but what struck me most were the contrasts between the two ming is a cold devoted and ruthlessly efficient whilst yan has been reduced to a tired and neurotic wreck after a decade of living in fearthe plot of moves forward at a ripper pace probably owing more to western action cinema than that from its own region the cinematography is bright and stylish and the climactic scene on the rooftop with the vibrant sunlight beaming overhead was captured to great effect australianborn christopher doyle who has worked on such films as 2046 and rabbitproof fence contributed to this film so you already know that the cinematography will be good there are several moments when the storytelling was not handled as well as it might have been the film made too frequent use of unnecessary flashbacks and following the death of superintendent wong anthony wong we are treated to a video montage that feels like the final episode of a longrunning sitcom also the failed attempts of mings wife to finish her novel i dont know whether hes good or bad was a blatantlyobvious attempt to draw parallels with andy laus character despite my trivial complaints is an entertaining and thrilling film that id certainly recommend to anyone,intelligence

waikeung lau and siu fai maks mou gaan dou is a gripping fastpaced thriller right from the beginning it grabs the viewers attention although i dont understand why different actors were used to portray the younger versions of lau kin ming and chan wing yan i mean people dont change that much in 10 years do they there are a few plot holes here and there but otherwise the central plot is very well written its executed with great style with fine editing effective background score and excellent camerawork the suspense and tension is well maintained theres also some interesting symbolism for example the use of the rooftop meetings perhaps the place where lau kin feels safest contrasting with the continuous hellandy lau and tony leung chiu wai are fantastic actors no doubt here too theyre performances are suitably restrained anthony wong chausang is also very good as sp wong kelly chen and sammi cheng dont have much to do in terms but they look goodi had seen the hollywood remake the departed before and it does not come close to this movie in terms of quality however mou gaan dou too has its share of flaws apart from the few plot holes and the different casting of the younger version of the two leads some questions are left unanswered for example why does sp wong and everyone at the force trust lau kin given the situation everyone was supposed to be a suspect yet lau kin is not only neversuspected hes also fed all the informationyet even with a few flaws mou gaan dou remains an entertaining slick fastpaced copper thriller,intelligence
what can i say about this film that hasnt been said already gripping from start to finish tense story developed characters and an often tremendous sense of dramatic irony how the characters are revealed over time give this great appeal as the back story of the two leads is slowly revealed in front of us piece by piece there is also a great sense of tragedy at times although i cant really talk about that without spoiling it so its best for you to see it yourselfthis is a very intelligent film much like heat which doesnt talk down to the viewer by explaining absolutely everything that happens  we are assumed to be smart enough to work it out for ourselves the plot twists and turns until its unforeseen albeit sensemaking conclusion and leaves the viewer thinking about it for some time after watchingi find very little to fault here perhaps with the exception of the introduction which can be a little confusing regarding whos who but it all becomes clear within a short space of timehighly recommended,intelligence
be warned  this review contains spoilers if you havent yet seen this film wow i thought this film was exceptional and believe me im hard to please unlike some other commentators here i feel that the relationships and resentments amongst characters are the thing that add the je ne sais quoi to this movie  as they are in the godfather to which it is frequently compared you can make up your own minds whether the comparison is appropriate or not the bitterness of both the lead characters about the choices they have made or had thrust upon them by circumstances  dating back in the character mings case to his time as a trainee police officer when he envies yans being kicked out of the force and in the character yans case his increasing bitterness about the loss of a normal life that the decision of his younger self has caused  inform their characters actions and add a layer of subtlety to an action packed movieother critics here refer to the female characters as peripheral unnecessary idiotic in fact they are catalystsin yans case to show how a choice but was it see ii made when a young and impressionable male can lead to years of bitterness and regret  for example his tears after meeting the exgirlfriend who pretends the child she has was not his  the inference being that if he hadnt been a triad she might have stayed with him of course actually he isnt a triad but a highly rated police undercover agent  but he can never let her know another female character the psychologist with whom he flirts during compulsory sessions finds evidence after his death that he was a police officer and has his memory restored to honourming obviously loves his wife and is devastated by her discovery that he is not the man she thought he was and particularly her upset that she has taken him into her parents lives  the inference being that she would never have countenanced a piece of gangster scum as a husband if she had known the truth her comments lead to mings decision that he will restore yans place in decent society and become a good guy himself  a plan which is taken out of his hands by events beyond his control however the buddhist philosophy at the end of the film makes it clear that as a result ming will live in his own hell for the rest of his life,intelligence
what more can be said about this exciting thriller i thoroughly enjoyed this film no end mainly because of the fantastic acting performances from two of my favourite actors andy lau and tony leung chiu waiwhat made this film the box office smash that it waswas the intensity of the two actors in there pursuit of founding out about each otherthe stylish camera work and the lush scenery were nothing short of breath takingnot all hk films need the bullet ballets of john woo to make a great film as shows,intelligence
this film is incredible it is extremely well directed and produced it has no gratuitous violence or sex just a great story with excellent acting and strong characters i thought the first few scenes were the weakest in the film i found myself drawn in more and more as the story progressedi have not seen the departed but cannot imagine how it can be better in fact i expect the typical excess of violence in scorcese films to hold it back after having seen terrible namei understand there is a sequel and prequel i can understand a prequel but not a sequel i feel the need to see neither since this film stands wonderfully on its own,intelligence
the following line isnt mine but its the absolute truth about this movie this film is cooler than a fortnight in antartica wearing a bikini drinking chilled vodka with icepacks strapped to your bodyin fact the quote is stolen from an anonymous user commenting on nikita but i just feel its much more fitting foreverything about this film is simply awesome if you like creative storytelling interesting characters great acting and camera this is for youthe best way to describe it is simply cool a must for any real movie fan,intelligence
thought chinese thrillers were all about style and blood as seen in john woo and ringo lams work its basically thanks to them we got tarantino watch and think again its a smart expertly made film which succeeds in telling a good story without relying on slomo shots or hyperbolic shootoutsthe hong kongbased film revolves around two men working on opposite sides of the law yan tony leung is a talented cop whos been doing undercover jobs in the triads for ten years lau andy lau is a mole placed by gangsters inside the police they know nothing about each other at least in the beginning pretty soon though the situation gets complicated as laus unit decides to take down triad boss sam for whom yan is working both sides realize there must be a traitor and its only a matter of time before someone loses in this catandrat gameunlike many other eastern action flicks deserves praise not for the inventive camerawork or bloody climax though there is some of the first but for the foolproof screenplay the plot is brilliantly constructed with believable characters most notably yan given tragic intensity by leung and remarkable intelligent twists mixing genre archetypes with shakespearean sadness and grandiosityin short one of the best asian movies of recent years and a great appetizer to enjoy before watching martin scorseses the departed a remake that for once manages to be as good as the original if not better,intelligence
this was a phenomenal movie even in subtitiles the acting was superb following a more of a straight forward storyline than the departed this movie kept you compelled for a full hour and a quarter it also kept you thinking this was the best foreign movie that i have seen this year and i think that martin scorcese should give more credit to the chinese crew this was certainly a movie worth seeing and i recommend you putting it on netflix straight away an easy 9 out of 10talking about martin scorcese robert deniro of goodfellas scorceses movie is making what seems to look like it will be a great movie called the good shepherd it is about the real story of the beginninign of the cia and i definitely cannot wait to see thatother recommended movies are 1 casino royale 2 the departed 3 the illusionist 4 borat 5 miami vice 6 babel all of these movies are great the best one is probably babel the worst borat i have to say that i was a tad disappointed with borat you just get sick of that character thats why i enjoy watching the ali g show moreethan,intelligence
i had bought a long while ago but never got round to see it  however yesterday on my day of i decided to go for it to sum it up i was glad that i saw the american version the departed first a while back ago and although it was very good  one can not deny that this was indeed the true master is proof that to find increasingly good films we are all looking abroad to places like hong kong and japan this movie was a cleverly constructed piece of art with no room for silly nonsense and a buddy cop feel to it the 2 main lead characters not to mention the main gangster were all outstanding the acting was truly superb and flawless the film had a certain attitude of its own which made it great although i am aware that it went on to spawn two more sequels i will definitely make an effort to check it out too basically conclude  is how to make a good text book thriller with no time wasting and silly subplots running about and because of that time will just fly by and it will want you leaving more make sure that this movie is on your 100 movies to watch before i dielist 89 out 10for now this is the shadowman wishing you good luck and good nite ,intelligence
having read numerous reviews praising ia i finally watched the dvd im not going to rehash the numerous favourable reviews but simply the praise is deserving ia is a very well made hk action thriller its well casted acted directed and scripted at times it did remind me of john woos face off with the goodguybadguy vs the badguygoodguy but there is limited action in ia as its more a character development building up to an inevitable confrontation between the leads i can see why this is being remade but i recommend you see the original before the departed note prior to viewing i was tempted into watch the trailers my suggestion is dont it will make the sequences that much more powerful and enriching on your first viewing,intelligence
id give the movie a 910 for the acting the scenery hey theres no such thing as a perfect movie right the ploteric tsangs acting as the leader of the triads sam was just brilliant his ruthlessness in all 3 films his belief that one could choose ones destiny was so believable i couldnt help but hate himandy lau portrayed ming so well after a while you see him as nothing but a double crossing man so keen to hold onto his position that he willingly killed gordon lams character to keep the secret that hes sams mole from leaking outtlcw what would the show without him the undercover cop who received the shortest end of the stick i cried when he was killed off it was like after he met kelly chens character dr lee he knew he was going to dieantony wongs turn as sp wong was good too i was so shocked when they killed him offi say watch all 3 for the plot no regrets,intelligence
this is the best thriller ive seen in years the doubleundercover scenario is brilliantly constructed and the directing is sharp the filmmakers blend dazzling action sequences with suspense and paranoia the identity crises suffered by the two moles lau and leung lend depth to their characters supporting players tsang and wong are superb as father figures to the two leads who themselves perform at the top of their game editing and cinematographer are exciting without being excessivehong kong has already made two sequels from this 2002 film and scorsese is reportedly directing the american remake that alone is a testament to the greatness of this film excellent,intelligence
beautifully shot cleverly constructed humorous dramatic and humane i never felt bored or rushed for a moment expect to have to concentrate on who is who especially at the beginning who is or might be on to whom and how and what they might decide to do about it others have said that the two leads are excellent and im sure theyre right but i especially appreciated eric tsang as samits elegant without being heartless i felt the main characters longing for truth in their lives and the various different virtues flaws loyalties and motivations of many others tooi was interested to see that virtually all the violence happens offcamera it reminded me of authentic productions of classical greek plays their plots often included murders but violence was not permitted to be shown directly a character would describe what had happened and then a tableau of corpses would be revealed on a wheeled wheels if i remember correctly from one production almost the same device is used in this film and its very effective when its done well as herethe friend i went with would have liked to the female characters given bigger roles personally im a woman myself if it makes a difference i dont care about that i did notice though the way the female characters were used as symbols to represent the good and truthful side of life it struck me in connection with this that sex and violence were being treated as opposites whereas in many us films they are treated almost as two aspects of the same thing and as depending on one another hardly existing independently how many plots are driven by the kidnapping or other illtreatment of the heros wifegirlfriendsqueeze so that the violence against her  whether she resists it violently or not  is used to justify and supposedly motivate the whole towering nonsense by virtue of her sexual relationship with the hero it often seems that the villians real offence is thought to be less assault on a person than theft of property and i wonder if when the us remake appears this tedious plot device will have crept in but i digress  it was just an idea that occurred to me on the way home and it tells you little about except that it may be one reason why i found this film refreshingan absorbing experience and has made me more inclined to seek out asian films in general as well as films by the same director,intelligence
when i was first introduced to the 2002 hit i was anticipating a hong kong john woo type action film with lots of shooting and high body counts did not meet that anticipation nor was it a cookie cutter action movie of someone elses idea the film is considered one of the best all time i can agree with the movie being good but that is about it i think the reason why i thought it was decent was because i just finished watching the korean 2003 sensation old boy and compared these two movies accordingly what the story of didnt lack was story and plot line of each character the biggest attribute of this film was story line the story of opposite sides of the law were very impressive and kept me interestedthe scenes of organized crime was articulately plotted and almost matched that of heat and jackie brown the god copbad cop image was well played by andy lau and tony leung the delivery of the plot wound up being somewhat straightforward in the beginning with a couple subplot twists later on near the end there was no real guess work needed the heist in the beginning was rather impressive and the opposite sides with the undermining battle between the moles of each side of the law uses of intel and surveillance techniques were pretty darn good one thing i do wish was some more action a car chase a shooting something but this type of scene was like a long chess game that ended in a stalemate i guess direction wanted to apply a sense of realism that not all surveillances and heists end up in violent casualties fair enough throughout the rest of the movie was all story and proper execution of each scene direction did at least that acting was okay but none of the characters were convincing enough for me to fall in love with dr lee the psychiatrist in which the hero yan was involved with had only 4 distinct scenes both yan and inspector lau each had a good story with a certain degree of depth were actually a bit bland i dont even feel for some of the role playing characters that get killed there is no real stirring emotion or drama there was some action but it wasnt focused on any specific action scenes overall is like watching a chess game and rematch of a chess game with different outcomes i cant discredit this movie for being an intelligent police story but dont expect an old school chow yun fat action movie like i did i recommend watching this movie as long as you take it for what it is 710,intelligence
andrew laus incredibly powerful crime thriller should be studied long and hard by all western filmmakers for a lesson in how contributing factors can together create something very special this film has an excellent new wave hk director a firstrate cast great script good production values and an overall rich and elegant style which defines it as being one of the best hk films in the last few yearsthe film is a cat and mouse tale of two undercover agents operating on different sides of the law working to bring down each others organization and expose each others true identity chan wing yan tony leung is a hong kong police officer undercover within the hk triads led by the intense and unpredictable sam eric tsang on a long term undercover assignment his real identity is only really known by his close friend and senior policeman superintendent wong anthony wong on the opposite side of the scale is inspector lau andy lau a triad working for sam who is climbing the ranks of the hong kong police department in an attempt to restrict their monitoring of the triads activitiesneedless to say the film goes into far more detail than that emphasizing strong character development personal relationships and issues surrounding honour love and sacrifice the film succeeds best on the basis that it draws on so many emotions and convictions emersing the audience in the lives of the characters and genuinely engaging with the events on screen the audience also grow to very much like both lead characters in a strange sort of heatesque kind of way and can relate to both characters problemsthe film contains a very interesting nonlinear narrative including flashbacks to explain the early lives of lau and chan and also contains some elaborate but not excessive direction techniques andrew lau famous for kicking off the young and dangerous popular film franchise seems to grow up somewhat with this film and experiment further with narrative styles and techniques the cast is nothing short of excellent tony leung in particular drives incredible emotion into the torturous lifestyle of chan and andy lau gives a subdued and anxious approach to lau eric tsang delivers what is probably his best ever performance as the triad boss sam which is at times both funny and terrifying anthony wong gets a rare opportunity to play a good guy and seems to adopt naturalism and nontheatrical conviction reminiscent in performances such as that in hard boiledthe film is a powerful reminder of how fantastic a movie can be when all the necessary elements come together they certainly did here see it for yourself now,intelligence
this is an excellent movie it ratcheted up the tension from the word go and didnt let off at any point this had a huge number of twists and turns to it far more than i had expected most of which were totally unexpected you generally found out who was on which side just as the bullets started to fly perhaps there were a few too many twists i found a little difficult to follow at times pretty quickly you found it was rather confusing to get the most out of the movie you really have to concentrate hard almost all the way through no slacking off it did at times feel a little shallow when there wasnt the immediate threat of a gun battle it felt a bit flat spoiler belowthe ending seemed wrong to me i was disappointed by the way the movie was resolved without giving anything away it was an ending that appeals more to the chinese i think we in the west prefer to see our heroes triumph,intelligence

though time has not been kind to it seeing as it was only released in 2002 the pace and style of the film feels dated the film starts with an opening sequence that is never explained or referred to again the audience is then thrown straight into a scene with many of the key characters you dont learn their names or their beliefs only that sam eric tsang is the leader of the hong kong mob and hes basically a bastedafter a brief speech a montage is set in motion i found it very hard to figure out each character and what was going on the movie flashes back to this sequence several times so i think it is important to make it simple to understand it takes a good 15 minuets to get a basic grasp on whats going on the first 20 minuets of the film is very fast paced you are forced to lean a lot of backstory and character bios in short amount of timeas the film progresses you figure out who you are routing for though as the story goes the line between good and evil is blurred and you are given the message if a man does bad things for a good cause is he a bad man or a good man i found eric tsangs acting to be poor and almost annoying in his attempt to appear evil he came across more as being a bit of a clown than a mob leaderthe overall tone of the movie was dark and thought provoking but due to the movie being subtitled it is hard to follow the intricate details the relation ship between chen wingyan the cop undercover in the mob and superintendent wong chishing to be believable and resembled a good friendship that is key for the story to affect the audiencei found this movie to have a good thought out plot and message that can be at times hard to follow the character building was hard to follow due to it being a foreign film many of the actors were believable in their roles i would advise people to watch this before the departed hollywood remake as i did not so found it more complicated to follow due to changes in the story and characters,intelligence

a truly incredible piece of cinema though the concept is very simple the idea of two undercover agents colliding from opposite sides of the law the film manages to combine unbearable tension with raw human emotion demonstrated with excellent performances from the cast each of which has their part to play as their characters career towards the final face off between tony leung and andy lau on the rooftops which in my opinion will go down as an all time classic scenethe script is sharp and not without lighter moments and there is no scene which is boring even though the more sceptical among us might question the relevance of some of the background stories of course the cinematography is beautiful combining style with an exposure of the grit of the hong kong underworld also worth mentioning is the inspired music ranging from tension building opera pounding techno and the ambient notes of the rooftop scenesin some ways it can be seen as similar to john woos classic heroic bloodshed film hard boiledin that there is the idea of the undercover policeman in the triads and tony leung does play this character in both but they are very different films there are a few references to hard boiled throughout which i wont say overall it is one of those if you only see one foreign film this year films but truly deserving of this title i cannot recommend it enough and honestly gets better every time you watch it and ive hardly mentioned the characters,intelligence
this is one of the best cop movies i have seen in years it is intense with a great story line this is the first time i have seen tony leung or andy lau in a movie but they were unbelievable in fact all parties involved with this movie were unbelievable the acting the directing the cinematography i even think the extras were the best i have ever seen okay so i really liked this movie brad pitt is doing an american remake of this movie i only pray he can do it justice because this is one of my all time favorites if you are reading this contemplating on seeing this movie or even buying iti can only tell you that by not watching this movie you are robbing your soul of extreme satisfaction of all that cinema can provide did i mention i really liked this movie,intelligence
two of the best male leads from hong kongs acting circuit tony leung and andy lau perform with accelerating desperation as a couple of snitches wholl do anything to protect themselves from exposure after a series of botched jobs which seem too coincidental a fierce witch hunt commences between the hk police forces and triad gangs to dig out their moles the story is the departed almost all across the board however cuts out a bit of the ridiculousness from constant character transitioning and is more focused when setting up the back story of the protagonists mainly for these two reasons i believe this is superior to scorseses homage it packs more of a serious punch while the us adaption feels comical in certain scenes which doesnt supplement the life or death scenarios moving on this is a great movie to introduce westerners to modern hong kong cinema as is tied very closely with the style of hollywood it is absent of some past hk staples such as silly comedy bizarre violence or overlydramatic romance luckily the movie keeps a solid pacing and concentrates on the time sensitive material at hand excellent screen writing and cinematography highly recommended for fans of crime films in general 910,intelligence

i managed to see both hereafter mou gaan dou and the departed in one sitting and would like to compare them to start i would give them the same rating 8 and praise them equally but the strengths are unevenwhat follows is total spoiler and meant only for others who have seen both religion in mou gaan dou the mob boss sam is religious he indirectly attributes his success to his faith and ties in the disciples through a ritual of loyalty he rules by this ingrained sense of loyalty and is never portrayed as fearful in departed mob boss frank rules entirely through fear violence and intimidation he caps this off with utter contempt for the church who would stay loyal to a guy like that class the departeds greatest strength is in the indepth analysis of the class conflict in new englands irish community references to lacecurtains and shanties is an allusion to longstanding symbolism of this conflict this was a compelling introduction to the characters that mou gaan dou left out and went very far to explaining their motivations  language the language in mou gaan dou is richly oblique at least i am not afraid to let the sun shine on me says yan toward the end and only occasionally rough the language in departed is relentlessly coarse and filled with coarse metaphors puns and references the language in each fits with the consistent tone of the acting the two main spooks are cool in mou gaan dou and nearly hysterical in departed overall the departeds beginning was utterly brilliant far outclassing mou gaan dou but the high level of violence in departed wore thin on me by the time of the big bust i felt that mou gaan dou leaped ahead in crafting a complex drama that was not just another shootemup the catandmouse chase between the spooks was far more compelling in mou gaan dou and the last scene in departed proved that not even scorcese can avoid the demands to give em a happy ending,intelligence
great story always moving very hard to take issue with the editing as the scenes all do well to keep the story moving or to develop the character stories of the leadsgreat acting the two leads do well in portraying an inner turmoil based on their secret lives the supporting cast of anthony wong and eric tsang are solid and believable in their opposing rolesgreat cinematography hong kong is a beautiful city and they took advantage of that  especially in the climactic showdown near the endonly one thing kept me from giving this a 10 and thats the use of 2 other actors to portray andy lau and tony leung as younger versions of themselves the younger ones look nothing like their older versions to further confuse things the younger guys are taller than the older guys also the younger guys are not as good actors as the older guysthis movie is better than its sequels and is definitely worth a look at one can only hope that the americanizedhollywoodized version doesnt screw it up,intelligence
the first part of an excellent crime trilogy set in china involving double lives heists gunfights cops and criminals and the actions of these men and women like hardboiled the killer and many other chinese gangster films the film revolves around two men who are never what they seem both are undercover cops both graduated from a prestigious academy and as time passes the two become entwined in each others lives once again each man is working for a different group and trying to work out who the mole is in their respective gangs the complex and complicated plot slowly and beautifully unravels until the devastating finish where we find out certain truthsthe film has been likened to heat and is being remade in hollywood this has greater depth though and if done properly and with skill it could be a critical hit in america there are few action scenes with more emphasis on the relationships in each mans life their loves and their friends what action there is is well done nowhere near as exquisite as woos work but that what give the film a different feel completely andy lau and tony cheung are both mega stars in china but are highly skilled and intelligent actors indeed the entire cast is impressive if you are a fan of chinese cinema part two is a prequel and the recent final installment is set just after the events of this one a subtle clever and worthwhile modern crime blast8 out of 10,intelligence
the strength of the movie is the story itself its about an undercover police who works continuously as a gangster member and a gangster member who works continuously as a police theyre trapped in fake status and psychologically suffer but contrary they really enjoy their achievement  devotion in this job life to them is infernothe actors are the famous actors with natural acting who show the emotional expressions and characters with their face  gesture even without any dialog neededthis movie will bring the audience to the state of contemplation about life where were all in a status where we may not really want to be and at the same time we strive to get the role we wantit really a good movie to spend your time with,intelligence
i had read plenty of reviews regarding this movie so i finally decided to take a chance and purchase a copy of the dvd  im happy that i did so this is a very smart crimethriller that does not depend on gunplay to make it exciting  as far as triad films are concerned it brings nothing new to the table  however the film was so tightly scripted and directed that i found myself glued to the screen the entire time i was watching it  i must admit im not exactly the sharpest person around so i missed a few subtle things that were happening and i had to backtrack so to speak in order to catch everything that was happening in particular scenes  i have watched this movie twice now and i absolutely enjoyed it  i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is bored of the usual triad big brother wannabe gunplay flicks of old,intelligence
i dont think i need to add much to the comments on this page really ia is a refreshing look at a well worn pathjust to answer the oft mooted query about the relevance of chans exgirlfriendi guess her brief cameo is designed to heighten his sense of isolation as he a lonely almost broken man with an identity crisis  is given a glimpse of what his life could have been likelikewise laus girlfriend is there to exacerbate his characters turmoil never allowing him to have any respite from his conscienceboth of these things seem to be shoehorned in a little and it would have been better to see laus girlfriend develop a little in character to give that subplot more credence the issues she raises in him could certainly have been explored morehowever the incidental meeting between chan and his ex is the sort of thing that happens from time to time and often sends you into reminiscence however in his situation it is enough to send his levels of self doubt and longing for a normal life soaring,intelligence
is the latest box office smash to make its way stateside unlike most films that americans associate with asian cinema this is a film that emphasizes plot and acting over action thats not to say its a dull art house entry that will fly over most americans heads its biggest strength is its densely packed simplicity a hollywood version of this film would probably try to insert more plot twists which would detract from the acting and intensity of the scenes that are already there this is a film about morality and the consequences of ignoring it too long it stars two of hong kongs biggest stars andy lau and tony leung chiu wai who despite their superstar statuss continue to make films that require more from them than pompous posturing they are real actors and always a pleasure to watcha film relying on suspense would probably be sufficient for most viewers but decides to take its chances and move further it taps into the morality and ethical turmoil its characters face theyve been doing their jobs so long that the lines arent so clear anymore theyve both done things that they know go past ethical codes they once held this is a intriguing conceit and when the film starts to play this card its hard to figure out whos the good guy and whois the bad guy obviously the cop has more integrity but the triad member also has his own demons to facenone of this would evoke sympathy from the audience if it werent for the subtly powerful performances by both leads tony leung chiu wai plays the cop whos holding his scrupulous ideals by the last thread he is so buried under all the pressure and his inability to make contact with the outside world his only connection to the world is his chief played by the wonderful anthony wong his portrayal is flawless because its so hard to decipher his changing nuances on the other side of the spectrum we have andy lau playing the triad whos having to constantly manipulate his coworkers and bosses while at the same time presenting himself as an ethical cop hes also reached a point where his lies have become truths to him everything he knows himself for and his family and his friends know him for is a lie his life is full of deceitful honesty he has a beautiful girlfriend a nice apartment and plenty of admiring coworkers but hes the only one who knows about his illicit secret he cant tell anyone because it would shatter everything he and they have come to understand his conscience has reached a place of false illusions and hes too scared to look past them andy lau takes command of all these emotions and paints a tragic portrait of a ostensibly unlikable characterdespite the films number of positive qualities it does have a few minor mistakes none more than the female leads who are severely underdeveloped this doesnt hurt the film but it stands out like a sore thumb against the rich characterization of the two integral characters however forgoing that small gripe this film is fantastic its one of the best and most sincere character driven films ive had the joy of watching in a long time i give it my highest recommendation and suggest you watch it before it is remade brad pitt has bought the remake rights it was also recently purchased by miramax for distribution in the states so it might be hard to find since miramaxe has a bad habit of purchasing films and not releasing them months and years at a time last i checked though it was still purchasable at most import outlets as a special edition region free dvd so do yourself a favor and purchase one of the best films to emerge out of hong kong in years,intelligence
ive seen many action movies from usa and other countries but when i saw this film ive been surprised the script is a gem the story leading the character elaboration with full particulars at all perfect the movie begin with a reminiscence from two boys who are together growing up in one community after this sequence the movie splitting and following two lines the two boys life the story raise the tension step by step and is not through many action sequences but with the characters dramatically lifeway and the elobarated character and their attributes i think the american filmmakers before or after will be copy this movie extra regard to kwong wing chan the music writer and yiufai lai  wai keung lau cinematographers,intelligence
the storyboard was great the acting was excellent the cast was a the movie soundtrack was a and the cinematography was atony leung was definitely the star of the movie his acting was so good that you nearly believe that the character he was portraying was indeed who he is in real life i was really sad when his character died in the movie in the end but overall the movie was no doubt one of the best shows i had seen in year 2002i think that this is a better movie about police and triad moles than the 1990 hollywood movie internal affairs starring richard gere and andy garcia there were some similarities but overall the hk movie was a better oneii was a good effort by the hk film makers too if you are confused about this movie which at times you would be wondering what was the reason behind each moles reason in becoming a mole you should watch ia2prequel first followed up by the ia and then the ia3  a sequel which has just been released in hk singapore and asia ,intelligence
my mate bought the dvd the other day and we sat down to watch it with great expectation  the movie never let us down  both andy lau and tony leung put up amazing performances especially leung whose emotions at the death of his superior were perfectly portrayed  i am a big fan of andy lau and thats why i wanted to see this film but ill be looking out for future films starring tony as well back to the movie  everything in this movie from the first scene to the last was expertly done and both characters were given a lot of depth the director kept you guessing as to which of the two would win the battle of wits right up to the end this is probably the best movie i have seen this year and one of the best i have seen in my life 10 out of 10,intelligence
greetings from lithuaniabecause the departed 2006 is basically one of my favorite movies of 21st century i kinda wanted to see one day 2002  a movie based on which the departed was made seen it only now for the first time i was kinda shocked  the departed isnt just a movie based on this one  basically its a copypaste movie sure directing was better and production values even acting in a usa movie but boy oh boy did i was surprised of great really is as the one who saw the departed like 4 or 5 times in my life story wasnt anything new one so to say the ending was different but i lived both endingsoverall its impossible to speak about without mentioning its hollywoods remake both movies are great in their own terms maybe in original movie they overplayed with some scenes which kinda looked a bit cheeze and not so in your face style like in martin scorsese movie but overall you should definitely see even if you have seen it usa version its a great movie,intelligence
two things i didnt know about the film until i came to its reviews section on imdb first this was remade in 2006 as the departed by director martin scorsese and second the two principal characters yan and lau are portrayed by two sets of actors while watching i kept rewinding footage back to the police training academy scene for the younger versions of the two men and couldnt reconcile their appearance with the older by a decade undercover versions another reviewer made the point would their looks have changed so considerably in the span of ten years or so not to my thinking and that confusion at the beginning of the picture was a nuisanceonce that bit of business gets out of the way though this is a fairly effective gangster drama with conflicted undercover mole lau kin ming andy lau providing his mob boss sam eric tsang the attempts by the police to bring sams organization down laus counterpart is undercover detective chen wing yan tony chiuwai leung embedded in sams gang and walking a tense tightrope after a major drug deal gets foiled both yan and lau are entrusted by their superiors to expose each other but at the point where they both wind up figuring things out a series of twists occur that spell doom for one of the principalsits been a while now since ive seen the departed but on the basis of my memory and rereading my review of that film i think it holds up a bit better with the double crosses and unexpected turns in the story i dont think that has to do with any bias toward an american film versus this hong kong product because as i stated earlier i thought the casting of two sets of characters in was an unforced error its still a good story though with a couple of nuances i want to revisit at some point later on,intelligence
in this film which would later be remade in the west as the departed two young men are forced to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with their identities and even very lives on stake because it turns out that one of them is an undercover cop infiltrating the triads while the other is a mole in the police force reporting directly to a powerful crime bossas in the departed the setting and the central idea is truly fantastic here the duality of these two men is quite fascinating both very similar in character in skill and in conviction they simply happened to start from different sides and yet their paths are eerily similar both shoulder the burden of secrets they cannot reveal even to their loved ones both have crisis of identity for ten years is a long time to live under pretense without it sometimes seeming like realitythe film is also beautifully acted and shot with skill andy lau as the mole and tony leung as the undercover cop are easily the best but the supporting cast is also strong though not quite all of them receive the screen time they perhaps would have deserved both love interests for example are barely in the filmthe only other gripe i have about the film is the fact the the plot lost me a couple of times i always got back on track relatively quickly but it still meant that i spent a minute or two wondering what had just happened ive had this problem with asian films before and its a matter of style they simply tell their stories a bit differently so not really a flaw but something to keep in mindoverall is a great crime film and i can see why they wanted to make the departed after seeing it definitely worth a watch for all fans of the genre,intelligence
is the hongkong based crime movie that eventually led to the birth of the the departed by martin scorsese the film certainly has its own merits but also its own faults the story is centered on two moles one of them infiltrates the mob and the other infiltrates the police force when both parties become aware of the infiltration a game of cat and mouse or should i say mouse and mouse ensues as each try to uncover the other one firstfor the most part relies on its strong and intriguing premise to keep the viewer hooked and succeeds its a competent crime film but if you begin to scrape the surface it quickly gives in while the two main characters are reasonably interesting their love interests are extremely underdeveloped and lack any of the emotional depth of the characters in the departed the direction is also far from brilliant tries too hard to be stylish cramming obnoxious fadeouts and pointless slow motion shots in many scenes still i could have let all of this go were it not for the most annoying fault of the entire film an atrocious soundtrack which isnt only incredibly cheesy but intrusive as well i admit i had seen scorseses remake prior to and no matter how hard i tried not to compare the two the superior work is obviousif you are looking for a decent crime film will meet most of your expectations however if you are hoping for something more i strongly recommend scorseses version,intelligence
the is a masterpiece no question about it it is a great film considering that it gives the audience something to think about in terms of morality and guilt as well as good and evil aside from that it also provides an insight of the gray areas between it the movie is about inspector lau and yan who are moles of the police force and a criminal organization respectively it focuses on the personal struggles they undergo as well as the spiritual battles they undergo in fulfilling their jobs and meeting their boss expectations the story is original and refreshing the acting was of highquality in this film tony leung and andy lau made portrayed their roles as human beings who have emotions that the viewer can relate to the rest of the cast are commendable as well they played their role magnificently inspite of the little screen time and lines that they were given hollywood remade the film and practically made no changes which is a testament to the quality and greatness of the chinese film martin scorsese also made very little revisions whatsoever in the film which also is a significance of his admiration to the direction of andrew lau from the original film the originalis a lot superior as compared to the american remakethe departed here my explanation about itis more realistic and has more emotional depth as compared to the departedit clearly explores the complexities and moral ambiguity that both inspector lau and yan are undergoingaside from thatthe material is very original and it is truly brilliantly madethe acting of the film is also great especially that of andy lau and tony leungthere are more interesting characters like inspector wong and samthe triad bossfinallythe movies ending makes you feel for both inspector lauwho finally became the person that he wants to assume by becoming a real cop through a series of lies and murder and yanwhom we feel considering that he never got his true identity back of being a cop and will always be remembered as a criminalthe departed is just a twohour and a half mindless entertainmentit is not an original screenplay since it is remake of literally it is a remake since it copied scene by scene of the  lolmost of the great scenes of the movie was taken from ia as wellalsothere is too much swearing in the filmwhy do the movie has to have the word fck said for 237 timesdo all cops and criminals swear every time they speakalsoboth billy costigan and colin sullivan are onedimensionalone is good and the other is badthere are too many characters and a lot of them are blandfrank costello looks more like a cartoonlike character rather than a mafia bossthere is less emotional depth and complexities as compared to the originalthen there is the pathetic character of vera farmiga named madolyndoes she really have to sleep with both colin and billywe are treated to the acting histrionics of the likes of leonardo dicapriomark wahlberg and jack nicholsonmatt damon is simply bland in this filmwatch damon in the informant insteadfinallythe viewer has less empathy to the characters since everybody just has to get shot in the endon summaryi could have given this film an 11 out of 10 if only i am allowed to highly recommended for anyone who wants to see an asian masterpiece,intelligence
2002  12 out of 4 since i consider martin scorseses the departed to be one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time it was finally time to catch up with this the original version the two films follow the very same storyline and while i prefer scorseses versions this here is still an incredibly well made film the one advantage this film does have over the remake is the stuff dealing with the drug deal and what follows i thought that entire scene worked better here and i also enjoyed the confrontation that followed at the police station in the next scene all of the performances here are very good and the directors style is quite nice the music score plays a big part here but i thought the ending was rather weak overall heres another example of a great original and great remake ive got two great films to enjoy so remakes certainly can work in todays age,intelligence
yeah i already said it in my summary i cannot write a comment on without mentioning the departed the reason for that is that without the remake i would probably not even have heard of yet and if i did i probably wouldnt have understood itwhereas the departed took its time to develop the background story of the characters rushes straight to the first big coke deal  a real edgeofyourseat moment in scorseses movie in this version you just try to figure out what the hell is going on unfortunately it goes like this for most of the movie the undercover cop doesnt seem stressed enough the bad gangster boss isnt really threatening we dont feel any real emotional connection to the heroes and villains at all ini know its not fair to compare the hong kong original to the american version scene by scene but you just cant help doing it when youve seen the departed first and enjoyed it as much as i did except for the main story and some key scenes however and the departed dont even share that many similarities apparently scorsese has never seen the original before he made his movie which would explain why he made his version so differentlylaus character was arguably more interesting in also the ending may have been a little bit romanticized in the departed personally i still think scorsese and his crew did a much better job at bringing the original premise to life in every aspect is a decent movie though,intelligence
vastly overrated is the kind of film that deserves all of the recognition it gets for the acting  but in the story department the film is arguably deficient the story of a crime lord using cops as moles has been explored hundreds of times and the film is really little more than variations of a theme why so many critics have been duped into thinking this an original and never explored idea continues to confound this viewerhowever anyone deserving additional praise is andy lau as the criminal mole serving within the police force lau has been showcased in many hong kong actioners as of late but here his reserve  the visible mental debates about whether or not hes truly serving the right side  give this picture its spine while many great hong kong faces can be recognized in the cast lau proves  once and for all  that hes a formidable presence in this formula cop picture,intelligence
scorseses version is far better than the original i watched this because of the overwhelming good reviews unfortunately i didnt see any good in it the acting was mediocre at best and the flow of the story was sloppy i dont know maybe if youre from hong kong or china youll be able to really appreciate this film,intelligence
i really dont get how this movie gets so become this hit i find the movie to be very average and it is a very easy to forget movie maybe because i didnt try to but any way to me the movie is watch able with a solid story line and acting than most other hong kong moviei dont know i think they try too hard to make the movie very complicated looking with different tricks and situationsanyway the movie is somewhat watch able and is recommended by most people but to me it only worth one to two watch but at least i think it would be better than the us remakerating 710 grade b,intelligence
the beginning slips by in a jiffy and the rest of the movie doesnt pause for long either so if you dont pay attention you might get lost im happy to report that none of the confusion evolves out of all the chinese characters looking alike because i can easily distinguish for instance the good moles dr lee from all the other characters shes gorgeous at any rate as the plot unfolds the characters become a little clearer and the plot while still thickened never quite clotsi saw scorseses the departed before seeing this the original theyre slightly different ill mention three ways one is that in sam the capo of the gang is merely a tough businessman who will when necessary stoop to murder in scorseses remake the role is much juicier and goes to jack nicholson who makes the most of itin the remake the bad mole at the end is assassinated by a secondary character his last words are something like go ahead and do it in this one the punishment is less violent and more subtle the bad mole suffers a crisis of conscience having lost his girl and his self respect and become instead a genuinely honest but guiltridden cop suffering from what in buddhism is called continuous hell the title would be silly if it werent for this notion americans evidently are not buddhists dont believe in hell dont believe in selfimposed suffering and are all for blowing the bad guys brains outfinally while is not exactly free of violence it is practically anemic next to the blood bath that is the departed this is an impressively executed film the photography is splendid and hong kong has never looked so clean theres nothing special about the dialog judging from the subtitles i once found myself in the position of having to study chinese and was pleased to learn that i could follow some of the dialog here the parts of the dialog that i could follow were the english phrases sorry yes sir and okay thank whatever god governs world history that hong kong was once a british crown colonythe performances were surprisingly good the characters mostly believably ambiguous with not a stereotype among them officer yan  the bad mole  who had infiltrated the police force and worked as a spy for the mob for ten years even managed to convince me that his climactic epiphany was genuine and that was quite a task the ends of chief s p wong and the good mole were honestly presented and for me and i suppose most viewers extremely regretfulits well worth catching but keep your eyes and ears open particularly in the first third of the film,intelligence
i saw the departed first and then i heard about this movie so for me infernal affair is the better version of the departed the basic plot of this film is about 2 spies 1 spying for police and another for gangster no doubt it is edge of a seat thriller but this film scores for dept and emotional turmoil that the maker showed so beautifully unlike the departed this film didnt had so much abusive language violence or any intimating scenes instead this film rather had a more spiritual treatmentone scene that i want to mention is where sp wong thrown from terrace and followed by confrontation with policeand then in the next scene tonys friend who was gangster dies by the bullet of police and the trauma and pain of tony leung was shown brilliantly entire movie was like 1 episode which was absolutely brilliant i gave perfect 10 because i cant give more than 10,intelligence
like me many people that have watched the departed may not know that the original plot of the film came from this masterpiece i am big fan of the departed however this is abouti thought i wouldnt enjoy this as much because i already know the plot to the story however blew me away apart from such a script plot twist the acting was sensational the main leads did a cracking job acted to perfectionevery scene in this film is absolutely gripping intense and electrifying the story is simple yet a masterpiece a mole in the police department and an undercover copmole working in the mob their objectives are the same to find out who is the mole and who is the cop you would think how can such a simple plot be so good however great direction cinematography and acting has made this film a joy to watch its one of the best action movies ive ever watchedthe reason why ive said should get the same credit as the departed or even higher is because that the departed is a remake of this movie and everything came from this movie its a shame that foreign movies dont get the credit that they deserve however its never too late please watch it will blow you away,intelligence
unfortunately for me i saw the departed before i knew about the departed was a good film is a better one however i will give scorsese credit for recognizing that he could not improve significantly on andy laualan maks screenplay cinematography and direction and realizing that a straightforward remake would be the best alternative nevertheless lau and maks film is better paced less openlygraphically violent though the body count is about the same as in scorceses film and as well shot as the departedandy lau and tony leung are phenomenal as the mob mole and undercover cop whose careers are painfully forcing them to triangulate in on each other with their bosses somewhere in between as their careers advance both men develop regrets which even redemption will not cure and the tension builds continuously as the films mood darkensis one of the most cleverly plotted crime dramas i have seen the plot however does not overshadow the films exceptional characterization acting dialog and cinematographyhighly recommended,intelligence
the hong kong crime thriller about two moles  in the police dept and the triads  was made four years ago the recent spurt of interest is largely due to the release of the martin scorcese allstar remake i havent seen the remake yet but the original is a great yarnat the start of the movie the police force throws out its brightest cadet in years and secretly assigns him to infiltrate the triads at the same time the triad leader sam gets some junior members to enter the police force forward ten years later and both moles are quite high up in their hierarchies and both organizations know and are trying to find the mole in their organizationthe plot has plenty of twists and turns and at least two amazing setpieces tony leung stands out as the undercover cop in a large ensemble cast i loved the movie but would not object to a remake in a language i can understand if the strengths of the original are retained and some of that scorcese magic is also present,intelligence
when my girlfriend suggested this movie yesterday i hadnt heard a single thing about it and wasnt the least bit biased but i was in for at real treat as it turned out despite an extremely hot movie theater almost 100  dependency on subtitles and a slightly disorienting opening sequence this movie caught my attention immediately and left me awestruck at the end its fast paced intense and well played i found the slightly noir filming very effective the use of music is sparse but appropriatenot the usual violence galore we see in a lot of asian films is a relevant and intelligent story about the fate of persons who set out from the same starting point but follow different paths in life and end up on opposing teams in a complex web of lies and deceit you constantly feel an escalating sense of foreboding as the characters real identities and sympathies are uncoveredwhat a refreshing relief from the sentimental drivel hollywood churns out not trying to neglect some of the work of giants like liman coen scott verhoven spielberg coppola de palma burton mann   unlike most hollywood productions doesnt rely on irrelevant eye candy and endless goodvsbadendoflevelfights to be interesting just a good setting a well crafted storyline and believable actingi strongly urge you not to let this kick ass cop flick get away out of 10 this is a solid 8,intelligence
this is a film that looks back to the likes of john woos hard boiled 1991 even bringing back tony leung in the role of the undercover cop andy lau does not have the gravitas of a chow yunfat but i cannot fault his expert performance  eric tsang who plays the triad boss sam is in a class of his own yet watching his performance i could not forget his ability as a comedian  unlike the early woo film is streamlined with everything contributing to the end  in other words the initial meeting between leung and lau is an intriguing introduction as it suggests the two men would likely share more than their interest in high end audio equipmenta considerable bonus is the presence of anthony wong who never fails to amaze me with his versatility  he has real stature as leungs control the only person who knows his true identitythe story telling in is impressive providing suspense and characterization all the while keeping the action moving at a breakneck pacei saw the film initially on a regular dvd this weekend i watched once again  in cantonese and dts 51  i was amazed at the difference these audiovisual upgrades made to my viewing and appreciation of the film  the work of the two directors of photography andrew lau and lai yu fai is truly dazzling  one wonders at the contribution of mr christopher doyle  chan kwong wings score adds mightily to the spectacle  but credit must ultimately go to coproducerdirector andrew lau together with coscripterdirector alan mak who gives us a truly cinematic experience plus an intriguing script to motivate his stellar castand it is a half hour faster than hard boiled,intelligence
the film is 100 min not a very long film but the pace is quick and is able to showcase the intricated plot to the full there is no excessive shots you can hardly breathe in the cinema it simply capture all your attention within that 100 minthe casting is superb not only is it acted by supetstars andy lau and tony leung but they are chosen not for their fame but because they fit in the rolesthe plot is by far the most enchanting and intricated story i ever see in movie the adpated story departed even won an oscar the famous rooftop scene the moment when two male leads listen to music together and when the handler fall down form the rooftop all inscript in my memorydeparted gives me the feeling that actors are chosen because of their fame some famous actors like jack has excessive presence that ruin the film it is kind of film that is produced to win awards and its wish is fulfilled,intelligence
i have no idea how the remake the departed compares but is so good it makes me completely uninterested in that remake that is wildly acclaimed as a masterpiece that should tell you a lot if youre not familiar with asian cinema there is no better experience for you than this movie,intelligence
i just saw this movie and thought it as wonderful deserving of the praise its received here in other users comments i would love to know who is the female singer in one of the scenes ive searched the user comments here and the brief soundtrack listing but in vain the scene im referring to is when the one of the main characters the triad mole in the police is with his girlfriend in their apartment and she confronts him about the cd she heard that is the recording of him with the crime boss  but before hearing that recording in the movie he is listening to his new stereo listening to a wonderful chinese female singer i dont know chinese but the singer is wonderful and i would be grateful if anyone happens to know who it is tia,intelligence
i hate the fact that brad pitt bought out the rights and is not going to make a american version of it if people here want to see it they should watch the real version of it and bring it to theaters with subtitlesi thought the cinematography and plot of the story was very intricate and developed the way it is presented makes the plot a mystery until the very end the follow ups were also very good however some of the movies conflict with each otheroverall the movie was a very good movie and i dont think leonardo dicaprio would make a good version of either characters hes a bit too feminine,intelligence
two things bothered me in an otherwise excellent movie1 getting different actors to represent the same person in their teens and a dozen years later people simply dont change that much nor do the choice of actors reinforce that similarity2 for all the high tech wizardry shown by the police force as well as the precautions taken for radio and phone silence why didnt anyone just check the handphone logs of every key player to connect the dots all the characters were using their handphones almost indiscriminatelygreat to see hk reinventing itself with such fine filmmaking,intelligence
i watched the movie twice on the first viewing the movie doesnt seem too impressive and different from any other movie in the same genre thinking that i was probably too busy following the story line i gave it a second shot this time i was able to see much more i even picked up many other plots that i missed in the first viewing the story itself is in stark contrast from most western crime drama where good and bad is always portrayed black and white in fact it does just the opposite that real life is never black and white the movie is closely knitted and layered the mindblowing death of the police team head and the most plain and simple one almost natural of the big gangster chief says just how the theme of the movie echoes at different times the use of different actors to play two main characters to suggest only a 10 year time difference is both confusing and necessary it brings ambiguity to the narrative at first but also makes possible the major twist at the end editing is done carefully to create enough suspension to deliver more impact to some scenes camera work is well balanced throughout the movie there are scenes with pure camera maneuvering and others that stress on acting skill tony leung has given his best performance to this film a sophisticated actor like him would know how to transform himself naturally to become the character not a completely different person only then would he be able to deliver deep layers of emotion to the character the nearending shot of an elevator running down the building is beautifully poetic the only inconsistency in the narrative is the territorywide sms message used to defuse the police bust of the drug deal fails to turn up on any single cell phone in the police hideout come to think of it there will be no more story if it does the film is both entertaining and aesthetic,intelligence
i find that before shelling out cash for a flick at the video store or down the local cinema its usually a good idea to check imdb for the overall rating given up until i saw this film this system seemed foolproofbefore i go on id like to say that i enjoy films from all over the world and am a fan of asian films so no bias there there were three main problems i had with this film firstly the concept was good but the implementation was flawed secondly a lot of the supporting characters did not seem to make a positive contribution to the film and last the ending was just plain awful a nice neat happy ending tm for some reason this film reminded me more of a cheesy indian film than the usual hongkong style flicks it just oozed cheese all the way throughout mixed with some mild drama and instantly forgettable sequences not sure why it got such a high rating here maybe people feel that just because there are a lot of good hongkong films then they all must be good or maybe they are just being fanboys and ignoring the boredom induced coma you have to pull yourself out off when you realise the film is over i definitely would not recommend people buyingrenting it but if you see it on cable its passable,intelligence
i enjoy hk films for being hk films i didnt need a hong kong director to go and make a michael mann film which is what this is its so well liked by so many that i couldnt resist sharing my very different perceptionsthe male leads tony leung in most cases is an exceptionally realistic and emotive actor are only defined by the activities theyre engaged in to drive the plot the female characters are at best peripheral at worst idiotica brilliant cat and mouse tale  psycholiogical thriller yeah whatever the whole things pretty wooden if you ask me beast cops is a film that suggested a new direction for hk coprobber films id like to see more like that is overpolished shallow panderingtohollywood rubbish,intelligence
as a big fan of andy lau this film is one of my favs i love how he excels in his role of a police officer with a dark side playing against tony leung was a great casting choice the suspense is drawn out and holds the viewer to the very end as a standard hk crimedrama a lot of the story techniques may be lost on the usual westerner unused to movies of this genremany might say this movie is average has an overused plot but it must be seen to be believedthe plot is unpredictable and the end was easily left open for the viewer to fill in the gaps as not every question is answered and the movie is all better for it no predictable easy shutoff endingandy lau plays his role with such cool character it can be seen in the western clich the bad boy he spins this role so well you can be scared that he is on the streets,intelligence
i finally got around to seeing this after hearing so many great things about itits the first of a trilogywhich inspired the movie the departed by martin scorsesei loved the departedso i thought i should check out its inspirationin my mindtheres only one conclusionthe departed is a better filmits much more economicaland easier to followit also flows more smoothlythis movie is a dent enough moviebut it tends to lagand i found it a bit harder to followin my mindthe departed may have been inspired by this moviebut scorsese took it and improved upon itfor memou gaan dou aka is a 710,intelligence
i saw the departed before watching and i unfortunately it was an letdown the acting was the best part in even the supporting actors did an excellent jobthe script was great but it was hard to follow at pointscinematography was simplified but beautifulmy biggest problem was the soundtrack they used wrong tracks at the wrong points for an example in a dramatic shoot out scene they used soft beautiful song with an lady singer which made the scene almost silly overall an good thriller flawed but interesting and entertaining easily could have been excellent but because of a few stupid flaws it downgraded to great810 worth seeing,intelligence
i had been hearing about this movie for a while and the word was nothing less then sterling expectations got even higher when rumors began to surface that martin scorsese was thinking of directing an english version with almost too much baggage i sat down to watch the film that so many seem to think is the next big thingmy first reaction as i watched the film was that to remake the film was pointless since i didnt think that the movie could be any better certainly it couldnt look any better or sound better any attempts to remake much of the film would only end up as pale shadows to this version one can almost see how scorsese will redo scenes say by using sinatra when the stereo is purchased this is as good a hong kong film as ive seen in quite some timebut and as you can tell by the capital letters its a big but the film slows in the second half a bit despite the fact that on every technical level the film never sags and some nice plot shifts that are very good the second half slows down just a bit too much the problem is that on some level we know how the film is going to play out and despite the plot twists its  just a bit too leisurely for my tastesto say more would be pointless except this is a film that is worth seeing 8 out of 10,intelligence
i can understand why this film gets so much praise its got the best hong kong cast you can imagine music and editing are extremely stylish the production design is great in every single scene and the writing with its slick dialogs and nice details is well professional however i think the quality of a thriller depends on its story and i found the one here despite of the promising initial idea not especially exciting even the rare action scenes and shootouts that have always been a strength in hong kong cinema were a letdown i have to say that this film feels hardly like a genuine hong kong movie if you think back to the golden age of hong kong films in the eighties and nineties but more like a hollywood high concept film we have a great idea to get the attention of the audience but no great script so lets cover it up with production value and people will still queue up to give us their money as this films success proves the formula works wu jian dao is by no means a bad movie it keeps you entertained very well but due to its mediocre story this ambitious thrillerdrama became neither an outstanding thriller nor an outstanding drama,intelligence
this film part of a series is stunningly good to watch as action movies go but unfortunately the copy that was shown at the angelika did nothing to clarify a great deal that goes on in the picture because it has the poorest subtitles that this viewer has witnessed in quite a long timeyes we get the point and we realize whats happening with the two principals and all the subplots but obviously not being able to fully comprehend the different nuances of this film we come out of the theatre frustrated thinking of all we missed when the subtitles are shown against a white or clear background theyre impossible to readdirectors wai keung lau and siu fai mak presents us with the hong kong underground we hope the other installments will have better subtitlesplease invite a chinese friend to come along in order to find out what you missed,intelligence
its films like this that gives hollywood the goosebumps hong kong cinema for years has influenced hollywood not say that hollywood influenced hong kong too but this is why hollywood wants to do remakes all the time i know that the undercover cop crime thriller theme has been used too many times but this film really blew me away is the best crime thriller ive seen in years tony leung andy lau anthony wong and eric tsang all give excellent performances the climax put the icing on the cake and was very unexpecting i respect hong kong cinema a lot from kung fu to crime movies they know how to make them i hope that more movies like this pop up in the future everybody has been making a buzz over this movie when it is released here in the us in august ill go see it again on the big screen luckily i was able to order the dvd i hope that hollywood doesnt dub it when it arrives here miramax for examplemy final judgement 44 stars excellent movie,intelligence
wow this is one of the most overrated movies of all time by the imdb voters the acting is wooden the story is choppy the plot is ridiculous at times the basic premise of the movie is a good one but the execution is poor the english version is really bad and the use of subtitles would have been better the friends and family of the director or producer or the actors must be sandbagging the voting process at imdb or the imdb users are suffering from collective brainlock dont waste your time with this dog it is highly overrated the director fumbled the ball the editor was asleep at the wheel i am out,intelligence

hey this was a pretty sweet movie lets see what everyone else thinkswait what is the departed,intelligence
the movie that inspired the departed  which basically copied this movie from scene to scene to murder to murdertale follows two cadet school trainees  one becoming an investigative cop and one being an undercover  assigned to arrest the triad kingpin  with moles on both sides things get complicated between both parties its a race against time to see who can reveal whos identity  with the stakes getting higher each passing day ,intelligence
this is a story about two young guys one is a police officer and he infiltrates a mafia other is a member of the mafia but works as a police officer both of them have done well and tried to get helpful information hiding their identity for several years however because of an affair police and the mafia notice there are spies in each organization the heart beating doesnt stop the story develops in good rhythm audiences cant take our eyes off this film doesnt devote too much visual effect thats good the scenario is perfect and we can enjoy this high quality thriller the departed is also good but i like this better,intelligence
okay the one main reason why i wanted to watch this is that i picked it up thinking it was an action movie because i am growing into a fan of action movies from asia turns out i didnt quite get what i as expecting but then again at the end of the day i really liked this movieokay so the story a mafia boss hires young people off the street with clean records to be a rat in the police department meanwhile a cadet named chen wing yan also is going to go undercover in the mafia a decade later one of the cadets named lau is a very well respected inspector while chen is a rat for the mafia lan actually works for and ironically chen is his most trusted lackey on a drug bust the superintendent and the mafia boss are aware of the rats existence they must find each other or either the mafia boss or the superintendent dieswhat i can safely say this movie does really well is suspense most of the movie i was on the edge of my seat almost literally not knowing what is going to happen next when some of these things do happen  it comes out of nowhere if the director of this movie went on to do any other thrillers like this i will certainly check them outevery other element is pretty well done too the cinematography the acting the writing but as i said the one thing that really holds this movie together really well is the suspenseif there was a complaint however is that the supporting characters are given too little screen time characters like superintendent wong and dr lee are characters that i thought should have been a bit more elaborated on especially with dr lees relationship with chen and with superintendent wong  when he dies in this movie the only emotion i had with it was feeling sorry for chen because the only person who knows his identity diedi will definitely watch the sequels or prequel if you count the second one and i will definitely watch the martin scorcese remake if youre a fan of thrillers and think this movie might offer some enjoyment from you  check it out the movie is worth at least a glance,intelligence
i think that this films has a metaphor of identity loss hk people have gone through these days and it give us entertainment of highly well acted and written genre movie it is hard to seek a flaw in this films id like to tell you this is must  see filmscompared with the departed a work of martin scorsese it has more deep emotion than scorseses work it has a deception a lie to see this films you can obtain meet a sort of satisfactioncompared with the departed a work of martin scorsese it has more deep emotion than scorseses work it has a deception a lie to see this films you can obtain meet a sort of satisfaction,intelligence
it starts really fast and tells the background of the main characters i needed a little time to actually figure out what was happening and who was who   after that builds up an arc of suspense till the very end i really liked the ending it gives this whole movie deepness it makes me think it caries a message the main idea of the plot is nothing new and in its basics quite easy a story about moles and trust the story kept me interested without confusing me i was never able to predict what was coming but i have to say i am really bad at predicting when it comes to movies   when it comes to acting i especially enjoyed the performance of the tow main characters tony leung chiu wai as yau and andy lau as inspecter lau,intelligence
you can pitch in a sentence there are two blokes ones a cop whos undercover with a criminal organisation the other works with said criminal organisation and has gone through the police training programmes and garnered for himself a place at the top of the organised crime prevention taskforce there you go one sentence the fact is as good as it is ought to be quite surprising in this regard shouldnt it i mean how often is it that films one can pitch in a line are not much more than decent bmovies with a snappy pace and a reasonably good idea is a rare exception to the rule a really cracking burning thriller about two men on the edge on the front line on the edge of the front line with their respective sides whilst working deep in the opponentsthe film will perhaps be more famous for inducing that botched overly long 2006 american effort at the same sort of thing a piece of which finally somewhat shamefully brought about martin scorseses oscar win after decades of tireless effort in propping up the american film industry with effort after effort there is a degree of irony behind the fact that in the hands of the americans the piece often came to resemble precisely what i established a bmovie a cut and thrust cops and robbers piece which was more interested in the getting to where it was going than the nature of what was darting along in the first place besides i dont see foreign language oscar anywhere what was the film that won that year hold on ill look it up it was canadas the barbarian invasions turns out hong kongs entry was in fact but it didnt even make the finals shortlistfickle nature of the academy aside is about two men on opposing sides of the law then they transpose these sides and end up on the other side but theyre still on opposing sides of the law we begin with leung chiu wais chan wingyan a man expelled from the police academy who eventually ends up being placed out there onto the bustling hong kong streets amidst the underworld and such in order to tie himself in with a local triad gang the police force would love to quash at the other end of the spectrum the triad boss hon sam tsang as already hit upon a similar plan wherein he plagues the police entrance tests with young moles of his own  the man who rises to the challenge in this respect is lau kinming lau who garners the trust of the policing peers and encroaches on lawrun ground for sake of the gangsters what makes the film work as effectively as it does is its writing its confidence that what its depicting is interesting and can be made to work here is a writer being granted a nifty little premise and being asked to run with it run with it he doesplay between the two sides begins to unravel with chans desire for something to give born out of living this double life an observant man he offers his thoughts on how the superintendent was perhaps in a rush on a particular morning born out of the fact his socks do not match an instance wherein we are essentially invited to play along in our observing of what seems out of place or out of sorts something that comes to plague the minds of those centrally involved once each of the respective sides come to realise they possess a mole distributed by the opposing side the meat of the narrative gets going it is the narrative above all else which grips us throughout a project covering two hardened people already too deep into their respective roles living under facades for there to be any real shift in dynamic either between or involving one of them away from the central story chan has a relationship with his psychiatrist an individual whose couch forms another instance of cover in that he frequents it in order to catch up on sleep this bond with kelly chens dr lee carries with it its own powerful tract in as such lee arrives in his life as the one genuine item their fondness for one another is the lone real element in a mans life of forgery and deceptionthe sense of cinema at work in waikeung lau and alan maks thriller is omnipresent a film with its varying interior scenes shot differently and creatively what with its varying filters and contrasts exterior sequences too which are constructed around a camera always watching on from afar as if to suggest what were seeing is top secret  as if how were seeing it is the perspective of a spy given the sensitivity of the conversations nature there is a sense of loss or pain when a character takes a hit or even dies being the mainstream film that happens to be unafraid of killing off some of its more important characters if it means keeping the drama flowing the thrill is in the delivery of the premise the balanced approach to either side the decision to depict either one as a character all unto themselves with their own problems and such the unpredictable atmosphere of the piece wherein one genuinely feels no one is safe where im under the impression that hong kong thrillers are often a hong kongdollaradozen stands out,intelligence
this is a really complicated story for me to understand and it is because of the relationship between each characters in this movie is so subtle and complicated the whole story shows us the people looking good may be a bad guy and we have the right to choose the way to live but we dont have the right to regret you need to be responsible for what you did and this is why is my favorite movie chen would be a good policeman siting in the office but he was chose to be an undercover as a bully liu used to be a bully but he was chose to be an undercover as a policeman a bully helped policeman to destroy triad all day and a policeman helped bad people escape from the punishment finally the bully was dead and the policeman got promoted this was the hell they lived the best part for this movie was its lighting effect when you watched this movie you can easily notice that it was from hong kong it used very typical hong kong movie lighting style to perform the whole story for example the dark light was through the whole movie every place was black brown and gray why the director chose to use dark light it was because of the story a story of hell the undercover was the secret and just as the word undercover told us they couldnt be exposed to the sun the dark relationship was main idea of the movie and this was why the director chose dark light the second technique that the director used was the background music i had to say that the music in was the most moving sound i had ever listed for example when sir huang fell off the music called the lost time came out just as the name of the song the time had lost cheng had been an undercover for 10 years and sir huang was the only one who knew chens really identity now everything had gone their secret relationship between cheng and sir huang and the justice everything under the cover lost the music echoed in chengs mind and he knew that he became a complete real bully without sir huang he lost himself this was also what the film wanted to tell us we may get lost in the life we choose but the important thing is that to find the way to get back look at the name of the film life is a kind of hell there is a lot ways to spend your lives you have your rightness to choose where you want to go but you need to pay for what you do during this trip everyone may get lost in their trips if you find the way to get back it is too late however if you dont the only place you can stay is the hell,intelligence
business this movie use a little low budget but it makes a very big hit to many theaters in the world won many awards all over the world many country buy a licensed of the movie including america and england it might not make a big hit at the west but it make a big hit at east acting every actor and actress seem to play good in this movie i have to say i love andy lau performance in this movie he play as a man who betray the system and the system got him back become paranoid and live in fear forever production its unbelievable project i need to worship the producer of the movie they think of many scene that remarkable in the movie like a elevator scene that in a minute tony leung was shot in a minute then when andy lau and ka tung lam enter the elevator seem that andy kill his allies because of his guilty and his humanity is still seen that reflect the human mind but bad guy want to become a good guy isnt that possible they should serve for they sin and live a life with fear,intelligence

just awful hard to understand no semblance of structure just not worth sitting through i was not taken with the characters or anything about the film it seems that the idea of avant guard films rules so much that people get on the bandwagon and say that this film must be great because so many say that it is just like lost in transaltion  a film wildly accepted by critics this film does not deliver on the promiseto be a good film one that has a story not drivel it needs to have the capability to bring emotions to us this film only brings the emotion of despair  despair that you are actually sitting through it just awful,intelligence
granted this movie is one of the better one that comes out of hong kong but it is still falls short of the hype that surround it  it is a decent watchable movie if you dont care for character developments or plots the energy of the movie comes from its editing great cinema photography coupled with sound effect  for example the pointing of the gun at andy lau at the rooftop was intercut with three different shots accompany by some strong sound effect  another good example is where the police were trying to catch the crime boss in the beginning of the movie  the excitement of that scene was helped tremendously by the tight editing  no doubt enormous craft has been put into the movie which excels in visual stylehowever like majority of hong kong movies the dialogue of this movie is flat and merely serves to advance the plot   the confrontation in the conference room after the death of the inspector is too contrived and worse still too conventional  there is not a single good line that stand out to illustrate the emotion and inner thought of the participants in that room at that sorrowful momentthe women roles in the movies are meaningless and one dimensional  i could not believe kelly chan as a shrink for one second and what is the purpose of bringing in tony leungs exgirl friend   sammy chengs role as a novelist is merely a plot so that she can utter something profound like deciding to be a good guy or a bad guy  it seems the writer feels there is a need to remind the audience that andy lau is facing a dilemma in the moviethe holes in the plot are too numerous to mention here  case in point during the hostage scene at the end of the movie  how come not a single cop is ever seen spoiler warning   why would andy lau kill the crime boss   it is totally out of character   it seems to me the screen writer do not want to take the risk of putting a famous actor to play a villain  i also find the ending where the writer informs us that tony leung is reinstated as a policeman posthumously laughable  the movie makers feel compel to resolve everything toward the end and enforce a happy ending,intelligence
this hong kong film is very lucky i dont know how he got its cult status its one of the mysteries of humanity for meoh yeah it have good ideas a good story but the production is highly amateurish the editing omfg it seems like that the idiot responsible to that wasnt worried to make a fast to gave unity that this film needs he was most interested in break the 5 cuts per second result its almost impossible to see any character development its almost impossible to watch the moviei dont know how i could finish it the screenplay is very weak really during the first half hour you only gets that those two are undercover guys because the happenings are so poor that seems that it never happened its nothing developed its just the screenplay say something that the nasty editor cut to another substory and leave that first one without the strength that it needsthe directors have unbelievable moments like some inconvenient slow motions and ridiculous flashbacks and the soundtrack jeez it has good moments yeah like in the opening titles but during the picture the music is just like on cartoon network series the powerpuff girls when its not those two options its a sad theme for a sad moment a romantic theme for a ridiculous romantic moment etc etcthe film has a good story good characters tony leung seems to work very hard but all of this for a fast100 minute production no problem in that the problem is the amateurish of the production that makes me thought if i wasnt mistaken watching the teaser,intelligence

i come to after seeing the departed out of simple curiosity to see how the two compared maybe its because i saw the remake first maybe its because i love martin scorsese maybe its because my brain doesnt do well with the conventions of narrative structure in asian cinema whatever the reason i thought this a greatly inferior filmthe central premise is very strong andy lau is brilliant and creates a deeper more conflicted and sympathetic character than matt damon eric tsang creates a bizarre but riveting version of barely restrained insanity and violence hong kong looks greathowever the story is so rushed so full of blinkandyoumissit plot turns that it becomes extremely confusing scorsese had the ability of controlling and shaping the complexity that mak and lau lack i had to skipback over several scenes and even then im not entirely sure i would have been able to follow the plot without referring back to scorseses version confusion leads in this case to a lack of engagement and ultimately boredom not only is the story rushed through but characters are sketched out in the most shallow termsthe departed was one of my favorite films of the year and one that i could and will watch repeatedly over the years to come internal affairs however left me bored confused and unegaged,intelligence
in the myriad categories of films that hong kong produces stand heads and shoulders above the rest and is rightfully lauded as hong kongs best modern achievementsimply put everyone from the cast and crew brought their a game and this is a high quality thriller that really showcases hong kongs talent in its film industry alan mak and felix cheung crafted a beautiful of espionage of a cat and mouse game between hong kong police and brother sams triadand this story is told brilliantly through the direction of andrew lau as well as alan mak himself the pacing is wonderful not taking too long for a plot to develop and never overstaying its welcome comparing this to the departed scorsese tend to overwhelm the audience with too much exposition with the actors dicaprio damon and nicholson overacting the scene making the tension urgency and drama contrived and asphyxiatingin lau and mak the drama urgency and tension is created through atmosphere conveyed by the actors along with the cinematography and sound the best example of this is the identical scene between sullivan and costello in the departed and lau and sam in in the departed sullivan damon finally met again with costello nicholson they had 5 minute chat of whats going on to fill the audience with whats actually happeningbut compare this to when inspector lau andy lau finally met brother sam eric tsang again there was no talking they just had a look there were flashbacks and everybody watching knew whats going on and whats going to happenthat is clever story telling to tell you a story without using wordsso kudos to andrew lau and yiu fai lai for a great camera work and the sound team for nailing the dramatic scenesdespite all my praise is not perfect yans interest with dr lee is unnecessary and the music for the scenes were cringey af yans relationship with may was also completely unnecessary here and out of place with the mays daughter being the is she or isnt she makes no sense within the context of the moviebut overall this is the best hong kong film that came out in the 21st century and it is conclusively better than scorseses the departed,intelligence

59 a slick well made modern hong kong bighitter that tells its tale of undercover law enforcement perfectly well this really tries to be more than just another fareast action movie with plenty of screen time for the characters to breath while the main focus surrounds plot development rather than fights and action as this does almost shy away form action which clearly does add more depth but it also marks this apart from the simpler more straitforward movies of this type which might put some people off but if you stick with it and put the effort in then youre rewarded with a deeper more complex beast than most cop thrillers from this part of the world,intelligence

a decent police procedural from hong kong that not only spawned two sequels and an american remake but whose look and style has inspired many police films ever since watch new police story for an example of how this films distinct visuals have proved so influential i really hate to say it but i actually think the scorsesedirected remake the departed is superior to this  its got a better ensemble cast more grandiose setpieces and a bigger epic feel to it is lower budgeted but still offers remarkable acting and an intricate original plot lineandy lau and tony leung are both fine actors whose popularity is a mark of their success in china theyre both able to get their teeth into meaty roles here playing undercover operatives on different sides of the law and even though they share few scenes together they have a shared kind of intensity its hard to pick whos best leung edgy and reluctant or lau icy and efficient and i think they deserve equal plaudits veteran support comes from anthony wong and eric tsang the latter finding a new lease of life in a career previously noted for comedy  he plays it dead straight herethe star of the show is the storyline which is inventive and well paced a catandmouse thriller like no other every drop of tension is wrung from what stands as a fairly simple premise each moment pumped for maximum suspense this is the kind of mature creative filmmaking that hong kong indulges in on occasion and when they do few others can come close,intelligence
this is the film on which martin scorsese based his 2006 oscar winning film the departed set in hong kong its the story of two cops one good and one bad and both on the wrong side of the fence but i guess if youre familiar with the departed then youll already know that the similarities between the two films are very striking much closer than i expected but more of my thoughts later heres a brief summary first summary haters and those that dont wish to know about the plot please try to discover who the mole is while i write the next paragraphlau kin ming and chen wing yan were at the police academy academy at the same time while yan was expelled lau graduated and rose up through the ranks the thing is yan was expelled for a reason for the next ten years he was to work as an undercover cop in the triads criminal gangs in hong kong only two people knew about yan one of them has died and the other is laus boss sp wong chi shing now working for the criminal boss hon sam yan is becoming tired of his undercover life and longs to be free of his duties wong promises him that after they get hon sam he will be allowed to return to the fold unfortunately as they are closing in it becomes clear that hon sam has a man inside the police force someone high up there are now two insiders a cop undercover in the triad and a triad spy amongst the cops its now a race against time to discover the identity of the other guy before he identifies you gripping stuff ill leave it there youll appreciate if youve seen the film that its very difficult to summarise this one without giving anything awaythis is a really well made film with some great stunts thrilling music and a tremendous plot hong kong cinema has come on a long way and it shows the production is really well done and there are some great performances all of the leading cast did very well in particular andy lau as inspector lau kin ming and tony leung chiu wai as chen wing yan both are excellent in this anthony wong chausang was very good as sp wong chi shing as was eric tsang as hon sam honourable mentions also go to kelly chen as dr lee sum yee and sammi cheng as maryi find it hard not to draw comparisons with scorseses the departed since this is the source material i found it surprising that the two films are very close in the plot devices they use if anything i slightly prefer this version it has something extra that i cant define maybe its because its subtitled and you are forced to pay more attention but i like this one slightly better of course i think it goes without saying this one comes very very highly recommended my score 9510,intelligence

martin scorseses film the departed was a remake of this hong kong thriller and while scorsese embellished the story in many areas stands on its own the story of an undercover cop inside a triad gang trying to uncover the gangs mole in the police and the mole trying to figure out the undercover is played more so in this hong kong original as a morality play rather than as this complex piece of work where no one is really moral tony leungs undercover officer yan is a good guy through and through where as the mole played by andy lau is the one who is constantly battling between the dark and light having to decide to be the good guy to only falter in the end the presence of the gang leader is less important in this version as a matter of fact this particular version is more about the police and andy laus inspector lau and his struggles between being good or bad so what can i say this movie is shorter than the departed just as gripping and is also a touch more entertaining cause it is so much more fast pacedi give a 10 out of 10,intelligence
just two words  see itdefinitely one of the best movies ive ever seen it can be seen and enjoyed on different levels depending on your cultural or intellectual dispositionsthis movie is as the same time a witty copvillain movie a human character study and a philosophical even religious talethe movie never judges any of the characters nor does it ever impose anything on you the backstory is subtly told and can be easily missed if you dont understand or guess the allusions though the yinyang characters are pretty obvious but even this is toned down by the shabby looks and violent behavior of the good guy vs the neat looking polite and efficient bad guyim afraid my european background made me miss some points but i love this film so much that i watched it many times something i rarely do the icing on the cake is that even when you know the whole plot you still appreciate watching it again and even can discover things you have overlooked on previous viewingsone word about the actors tony leung andy lau anthony wong eric tsang edison chen shawn yue sammi cheng kelly chen chapman to lam katung elva hsiao not to mention francis ng leon lai carina lau daoming chen in ia ii  iii what a cast all of them know how to play well maybe not edison chen and they play wella special mention to tony leung and anthony wong there is no doubt the movie wouldnt be that strong with any other at their place and the crucial middle movie scene wouldnt have that emotional impact on the viewerthose two guys carry the whole movie on their shoulders theyre not playing cops theyre human beings with their contradictory emotions their mistakes their somewhat unfulfilled lives unraveling before us andy lau though great throughout the movie cannot compete with them but i have to admit that the third episode it fully hisso just see it but see it with eyes and mind open,intelligence
rather complex tale of intrigue and action between hong kong gangs and police special task force with each side trying to out match the other the inspectors and the gang boss have long history and so do the inspectors themselves this gives the story enough ways to twist and turn the plot until the rather surprising ending this series could be said to be hk cinemas version of god father trilogy not that its a tale about a god father but the story driven plot is as good or better than the mario puzos classicthe old guards of hk cinema andy lau anthony wong shows that they still have the stuff to make the best cinema experiencetruly a story driven plot line thats unmatched by any cinema producing factory,intelligence

its no wonder that 2002 was eventually picked up for an american remake being the kind of film that hollywood used to churn out by the truckload in this respect im talking about sharp entertaining and energetic cinema something that presents an intelligent story and interesting characters but in a way that actually advances somewhat on the basic limitations of the cinematic medium its also a film that owes something of a larger debt to american cinema placing the emphasis on character and the mechanics of the plot but at the same time managing to revitalises it even when its pandering to the most obvious clichs yes you could argue that the setup is simple  some might even say pass  but the cinematic language and the way in which the conventions of cinematography editing music and design are used to propel the story even further is staggering drawing us in with an evocative style lingering atmosphere and a breakneck pace that picks us up and carries us along on this dark and dangerous trawl through the notions of loyalty identity and deceitthose who are closeminded enough to think that all films made outside of the us are ponderous slowmoving meditations on personal issues are wrong and films like this prove it without question is not only one of the best crime thrillers of the last ten years but is also a fascinating character study looking at the specifics of loyalty and duality and also the issues of honour and duty the characters are smart believable and brilliantly performed while the central theme of the hero pretending to be the villain and vice versa offering an original slant to the undercover subgenre of crime cinema without losing the aspects that make it work the entire film is just astounding filled with character action and moments of real drama while that ending is fraught with all kinds of tension conflict and crippling emotions is easily one of the best crime thriller since the usual suspects 1995 and the only film to rival oldboy 2003 as the greatest crime thriller of this decade,intelligence
this is a film not about crime well  no matter how the film was seen as a crime story in surface for me this film is all in all about the style of life and belief in which you stand and the attachment into humane as always tony leong expresses his warm depth of care and his affection into humane which give certain taste in the deep sorrow and meaning of life that goodness could not be sometimes easily prevailing in a real sever world but could be in total as a film with the direction all casts and crews and strongly with tonys sense as well  i strongly assume so within the sensitive balance between the sever perspectives into the reality and the genuine belief into goodness certain encouragement for another belief into the goodness was not certain i will and each should tell the answer in real life in keeping their goodness with hisher very best that is my answer to the uncertainness or unclosed ending psthe vote is between 85 or near of 9 around actually by the way,intelligence
i am talking here about the trilogy not i the first thing you need to know is you have to buy the trilogy there is no point in watching them out of sequence and if you watch part one youll be chomping at the bit to see parts two and three so you may as well have them nearby i watched one with no real expectation and ended up putting two and three on backtoback the story is compelling but it is the ensemble acting that holds your attention amongst a stellar cast eric tsang steals it for me a compact package of menace and charm reminiscent of bob hoskins in the long good friday it takes a phenomenal performance to scenesteal from tony leung but tsang manages it the comparisons to the mediocre heat are unfair the comparisons to the godfather are nearer the mark though this is not as overblown other reviews give you the story outline my tuppenceworth is that this is as compelling a film as i have ever seen the emotions are real and you will rarely empathise with two protagonists as fully as you do in i stopped short of full marks because of one missed beat  the romance subplots i didnt think ming and his wife really seemed an item and kelly chen is wasted in a somewhat two dimensional role to give yan a romance interest i was interested to see another reviewer rate yans encounter with an old flame as a highlight scene  for me it is a subplot that goes nowhere a transparent attempt to ratchet up the sympathy for yan that particular storyline reappears in iii and still fails to get off the ground still who cares about ming and yans relationship with women it is the intertwining of their respective fates that drives this trilogy forward the film did not get as much attention as it deserved in japan but perhaps the arrival of the scorcese remake will spark a revival,intelligence
i started this comment with title slightly overrated and then i realized my vote is almost exactly the average for this movie it is a good movie no question about it but to think its great the greatest etc you got to be a real fan of andy lau he delivers an ok performance although its actually tony leung trying to keep the movie together the best thing about the movie is the ending  well balanced well paced and  for a few minutes  quite convincing nonetheless few problems remain first the story is not that original its a new variation on the classic mole plot already present in many other hk movies you cant stop comparing and well some of them were better imo second  and more serious it demonstrates a popular contempt toward viewers iq well ok that contempt may be sometimes justified but still i dont mean standard fairytellness that has certain charm there are simply several moments and threads that are just ridiculous with the very main one minor spoiler  does hk police really has only about 10 officers so when they know there is a mole within this small group they still have to assign to one of the suspects the task of finding the moles identity people that is soooo crazy there are quite a few other flaws  like both moles could have been easily discovered few times etc still the movie is very enjoyable real fun to watch acting is decent music is very good cinematography good  sometimes excellent so altogether a solid b grade  8 points,intelligence
i just saw hero on the big screen in the us today id seen it several times on dvd but wanted to see the cinematography the way it was meant to be seenanyways much to my surprise i saw the trailer for a release of for the us this is the original release from hk not the remake by the us to be done by martin scorsese im very delighted to see the surge of attention that asian films are getting here in the us the scorsese version will probably do the movie justice but its good to see that credit is being given to the original makers,intelligence
unlike the departed  which screenplay is a bastard version of this one  in the plot is well drafted and structured with little or no loopholeshowever the way that the story has been put to screen could and should be a lot betterthe characters are well built and interpreted by excellent actors but the pace of the action is too slow to be frantic and too fast to be immersivethe directors simply crammed to many scenes most of them quite slow in pace into just 90 minutes clearly loosing their grip on the editing this story deserved at least 30 minutes more of background action to beef up the spectators perception of the risk and strain in the two main characters respective double lifesall and all its a good movie however it does not fulfill its whole potential,intelligence
is striking in that it is first and foremost a showcase of production values and top talent while there story setting themes and characters none of those are as central to the purpose of these productions as the production itself at no point in the process of watching these films does one not realise that one is watching production values somewhat like watching old mgm films which is why the films themselves are advertisements for their own hollywood remakei do not doubt that scorsese chose to remake this film because it is a familiar theme and andy laus natural swagger parallels that of leonardo dicaprio i do think that the biggest reason he chose this particular project is because it has everything that makes up a film except traces of subjectivity attempts at illustration of the produced reality colour those are scorseses focus and fortei dont know if nonindigenous viewers understand this but the hong kong film industry currently has a very strong focus on exporting their talent and products to hollywood with it shows that they have figured out how to successfully advertise to hollywood by embedding a blaring element of lack in an otherwise meticulously produced piece,intelligence
this first installment in a trilogy is very stylish and well written the film is presented and photographed in a very unique way unfortunately though i didnt find it captivating enough and slow movingtheres a lot of trivial moments taking up running time romance feels forced in the film and quite frankly theres no room for it in this film its a very clever script but also very confusing if you dont follow closely at times it felt overdramatized like a tv soapieit is a very good film  just not my type of film as with most crime thrillers i doubt ill remember this for a long time,intelligence
follows the police department as they attempt to find the criminal mole in their midst while the opposing gang attempts to find the undercover mole in their group if you ask me this is a pretty awesome concept neither side is able to get anywhere with the other because theyre both constantly receiving information from the other its a conflict that cant end with either side winning until they take action specifically against their opposing moles im not doing it justice but its pretty coolunfortunately it doesnt handle it nearly as well as it could the acting for starters is okay sometimes its good sometimes its bland it really depends most of the time it was pretty good but it does falter enough for it to matter the movie suffers from its lack of ability to develop any of the characters or their relationships some of them have romantic relationships that are treated like a major part of the story but theyre so poorly written and unfocused that it makes it hard to really care about them my biggest frustration with the movie is the editing its hilarious how dated it is multiple scenes end with a still frame while dialogue continues to play followed by the screen fading to black when did this movie come out 2002 yeah its a little late for that clearly someone didnt get the memo overall has an awesome concept that it couldnt quite pull off the writing and characters arent fleshed out enough and the editing is hilariously dated in the end id really only recommend this movie to a handful of people,intelligence
is one of several gems that i have in my dvd collection i have heard about the film over the internet browsing this very websiteironic isnt iti was a fan of andy lau fulltime killer and tony leung chungking express before but seeing them act on screen was a great experience i believe that their pairing mirrors that of al pacino and robert deniro in heat the genre has been played out desperately but the way leung and lau show their characters torment and struggles with morality it makes it easy to forget i recommend this film to anyone unlike others i am looking forward to seeing the departed when it hits theaters this fall dicaprio and damon have the proper acting talents to make these characters believable plus the godfather of mobster movies is directing it bonafide oscar contender and maybe the one that nets scorsese his oscar,intelligence

i happened to see wu jian dao by accident friend brought a dvd from london and as i do like asian movies i thought why not after first few minutes i didnt regret honestly i could say i drown into the movie well honestly i expected some kind kungfu flying movie which i love anyway and to my surprise i got the very best and intelligent movie with smart screenplay very fine plot great actors unexpected end no wonder the movie got eight awards in hong kong movie festival so if you want to see good police drama you will probably love that one enjoy,intelligence
is not simply an action movie in fact there are few bullets and fights but more tension than ever it tells the story of cops and triads that both of them has its own secret agent in its rivals the tension was built when the police and the triad society both realised there were someone who spoiled their own secret plans the performance was excellent anyway it is the script that have brought the movie to a higher level firstly the exciting movie did not only entertain us but messages were delievered when the movie was shown in hong kong in dec 2002 it has started a wide discussion of the movie from the medias to religionous leaders all the hk people are talking about the movie in fact the movies gross box office was more than 700 million us dollars more than that of harry potter and the chamber of secretsabout 500m and heroabout 350m being the most popular in 2002 a us movie production company has bought the rights to shot a uss it is really a great movie as the only way to prove it is to watch it i hope can be shown somewhere else soon to prove its quality,intelligence
went to see this movie recommended by a few friends  well they hadnt actually seen it yet but it came with high recommendations from the natfilm festival here in denmark so we went although chinese films are not my cup of teawhen the film ended we didnt need to speak amongst us to see how we all reacted to the film  and we had all nearly fallen asleepthe story is a good idea no question about it but the way the film technically is carried out is mindnumbingly boring and tedious  it sets off to a lot of action sequences that never actually reaches the heights they are supposed to the film mostly look like an american action flick from the mid 80ies and it doesnt help that the acting apart from the two leading characters is more than horrible in a few scenes it is actually so horrible it is almost painful to watchi dont knowrumours say martin scorcese bought the rights to remake this in the states and for once i feel that an american remake can only get betterobviously he likes the story cause there is nothing else to like about this piece of boring crap310  still chose to give it 3 cause the story is good only horribly carried out,intelligence
this film begins with two men in the police academy yan tony leung is drummed out for some rules violationthough he is actually going deep undercover to join the mob and infiltrate it for the police lau andy lau is the oppositea seemingly exemplary cop whos been planted in the academy by the mob soon the mob plant is an important inspector working for internal affairs and sending his mob boss all the police moves against the organization and the only one who seems to have a prayer in finding him is yanand both are looking to unmask each other but who will find out the identity of the other first plus yans job soon becomes a lot more difficult when his one and only police contact superintendent wong is murdered now no one in the police force knows who he is or can offer him any helpand everyone thinks lau is beyond reproach and the full power of the force is behind himas well as the mobthis film surprised me after all id already seen the americanized version of this film the departed and didnt love the film despite its many oscars however was a much much better filmwith characters that made more sense as well as a profoundly sad and moving ending overall its one of the best films from hong kong i have had the pleasure of seeing and strongly recommend you give it a try,intelligence
the given is that a remake will not be as good as the original it may be there for reasons that a studio needs to put out something they have the rights now lets do another spin on it and its not like remakes are new theyve been around since the 1930s in film maybe even before that were silent films remade from other silent versions maybe but i digress the departed was one of those rare occasions where not only did the filmmakers and actors improve on the previous story they added to it enhancing the plot of course the main ingredients were there in lau and leungs film but its like taking a bite out of a piece of fried chicken from your local chinese food delivery and getting a crisp goldenfried piece from that awesome restaurant in the city  same bird different spices and oil i should let this film on its own speak for itself and to be fair it does work on its own as a film but the work of scorsese monahan dicapriodamonnicholson et all took the main plot and ironically scorsese quipped it was his first movie that had a plot and added humor subtext extra characters real romance and stakes that werent there beforeis a good movie though because its plot is strong and compelling  you got the cop undercover in the mob and the young mobster picked by the boss to be undercover in the ranks as a cop the dramatic possibilities are on a silver platter for any writer though on the flipside it could become clich and trite in the misguided hands here we get a story that has very little fat storywise as we follow the drug busts the twists the tracking of one cop to another and the deaths of certain cops and criminals and its ultimately about the price paid morally speaking in this world  which can be a lot or a little depending on which side youre onagain its hard to undersell how much the departed looms in my mind seeing the film its not totally fair i know this but its also hard when so many scenes are much alike and yet you can see where in the opposite of what happens in adaptations the new filmmaker adding to whats already there and yet theres certainly good things to recommend about especially if you like specifically hk cop movies  actually if youre a diehard follower of those this seems to be a quintessential watchat the top of whats good here are the two main actors tony leung and andy lau as the cop and criminal undercover respectively leung has the more intense part  when we see him after a prologue he has been undercover for 10 years  and i was astonished by how much he dug into the turmoil of this character normally i see him in more romantic stuff like wong kar wais films but here as in the grandmaster he shows he has the cops for it lau is also very good but has to play more reserved isnt the word but he has to show fewer emotions unless hes with his psychiatrist girlfriend not that developed as a character by the way just enough to get by the two actors how they play every scene is captivatingbut while the villain here sam eric tsang is fairly strong i never felt much of a threat or sense of danger about him again hard to stay away from its american version but theres much less there than in nicholsons character albeit that had the boost from whitey bulgers story from boston with the exception of maybe a couple of scenes like when the drug deal goes down in the first act of the film he too doesnt seem to have much to do except act sort of menacing in a subdued sort of way to his underlings its not that he has to be fun or exciting but maybe he does maybe he could have been the wildcard or piece of mania to give the material that extra boostworks as a kind of welloiled machine of a thriller and hen those major turns happen  the reveals of who is really who and not what really seems is what it is  its satisfying but its got its share of flaws namely in a score that is sappymelodramatic like right after when the death of a particular character happens and the hero looks on in despair and while the directors here have a lot of excellent shots and cinematography to work with in the hk skyline and always with the rooftops a joke is made at one point which is nice theres flashbacks once too much i can give it to this movie that unlike some other hk action thrillers this isnt convoluted its straightforward enough really actually so straightforward it doesnt need certain obvious moments repeated for the audienceso in short even if id seen this before the departed it would still work as a movie but it has shortcomings as it is i didnt find it to be that alltime great hk cop thriller that some have elevated it to and if one puts it up against a interpretation by a master filmmaker the faults show more,intelligence
is the story of two undercover agents that infiltrate two opposing organizations and pretend to be people theyre not inspector lau infiltrates the police force posing as an officer of the law but really is a spy working for a crime lord yan infiltrates the crime lords gang posing as a crony but really is a spy working for the police force given these premises the film significantly comments on the nature of identity in particular the identities of both agents become convoluted as they dive deeper and deeper into their counterfeit worlds the costume design really helps blur the line between their counterfeit identities whether cop or criminal they both wear business suits along with everyone else this suggests the idea that you cant tell whos who in an environment where everyone dresses the same it also compliments one of the predominant themes of the film the more you pretend the more you become with this theme ill now explore how it lives through the character transformation of inspector laulau is a very peculiar character although he works undercover for a corrupt organization he is far more rounded than a stereotypical crook i never actually considered him to be a bad guy just someone who was confused about how to be good unlike the people he works for the viewer gets a glimpse into his personal life away from his corrupt job the result we identify and relate to his situation and are more sympathetic his life apart from business consists of him moving into a new apartment with his girlfriend he seems to treat her fairly well his girlfriend plays a crucial part in the story in revealing who lau really is she is an author writing a story about a man with multiple personalities and who wakes up one day and forgets which personality he is she struggles to figure out whether this character is good or bad and so asks lau if he would write the ending this powerful plot point speaks on multiple levelsone being that her story is a reflection of laus double life another on how lau takes fate into his own hands and becomes the author of his life rather than a victim of circumstancelau struggles to keep control of his identity because somewhere inside him he yearns to be good in fact he yearns to be like his role modelyan as the plot progresses lau finds himself responsible for the death of police boss sp wong this is one of the first character beats in the story that suggests that lau does not like the identity he has created for himself he has pretended to be good this whole time but feels internally that he has deceived not just the police force but himself how does he respond he takes fate into his own hands and kills his own crime boss sam the decision to kill sam is an act of redemption that implies that lau is not who he used to be and wants to turn over a new leaf to connect his transformation to the theme of the story consider how lau really does become what he had pretended to be by pretending to be goodby lau pretending to be a loyal cophe eventually became goodhe took down the crime organization i think this is an incredibly powerful concept to not only understand but to apply into ones life its as aristotle once said be in reality as you wish to seem by pretending to be what one isnt a person slowly evolves into what he or she now no longer has to pretend to bethey simply are i think in one respect what makes a person good is his or her ability to mimic a righteous ideal one that promotes merciful yet just behavior i dont think lau was always striving to achieve this principle of living but he definitely shows the biggest turn around by divorcing himself from the corruption he used to swim in,intelligence
i saw departed before seeing so i was about to follow whats going on in if i havent seen departed then i would not know whos who in my opinion i think departed was better put together as a film that left out lots of background info from each character it was harder to follow along that the departed but i was told that if i watch the three movies following everything would become clearer i guess i have to watch the next three sequels and see if they clear up everything thats also less action that i expected i do recommend this if you watched the departed already the actors did a very good job though,intelligence
it was a watchable movie i am not a chinese so my review does not get swayed by any emotional attachment with hong kong cinema i feel a lot of hollywood movies from the same genre have done much better in this movie the setting is good actors are excellent but the plot is too predictable i lost the excitement in the midway nothing edgeofthe seat about it as there is little to be revealed the climax is also quite obvious however the movie has an extended climax if you agree which is a little more effective buddhas message sits well with the intended message the director wishes to convey you will be made to think for a while about what exactly may happen next at the very end of the movie thats one good thing about the movie,intelligence
ill be honest i saw this film after seeing scorseses american remake and so my viewing was consciously more of a venn diagram between the two versions than seeing it as its own beast scorseses towers over this film but not without a few preferences from hong kongs side of the conceptthe head of the special investigations unit for whom the undercover cop played with a highlight performance by tony leung chiu wai works played in scorseses the departed by martin sheen is portrayed so much better in this version despite how much better the departed is than its predecessor there was a stiffness to martin sheens performance and in some of his scenes especially his final one which in this version is given a much looser less comfortable and frankly better stylized effectthe scene in which two henchmen are joking about how to spot undercover cops is handled so much better in this version in the departed theres an inexplicability about the scene because it doesnt seem funny and it doesnt seem to have a purpose in the scene grows organically out of the dialogueearly in the crime boss played by eric tsang and his entire gang is in an interrogation room with the entire special police unit on the other side both sides facing off both the cop undercover in the gang and the rat undercover with the police glancing about having no idea who each other really are this is a headon pointblank scorcher of a scene i dont know if this would be allowed in a police station in america but if that isnt an obstacle i wish with the natural energy of this scene that it could have been one of the elements mirrored in scorseses version especially because the characters in his film have thicker broader contrasting personalitiesis a decent thriller yet it lacks the density and might of scorseses version for instance the female character in the departed is a very human poignantly pegged police psychologist played sensitively by vera farmiga in each male character at least each one with a roman numeral in the alphanumerical outline has their own respective laxly probed girl character the most hollow of which has the least amount of screen time and is for some reason featured on the cover scantily clad with a hand cannon as big as her head the likes or ensuing effects of which she is not seen anywhere near in her very spare time on screenfeatures flashbacks during its unraveling of plot twists these flashbacks consist of replays of scene fragments that weve already seen as if we didnt pick up on them before its one thing when were looking back to get a look at something we already saw from the other end of the telescope but here were only being refreshed which isnt needed if a movie shows you something then its trusting you to absorb it to replay it for the same reason you showed it in the first place is an insult to the audiences intelligencethe departed digs deep into the culture of its irishamerican environment implying few degrees of separation between distant characters upbringings the aging neighborhoods and details of that nature i suppose didnt need to do this but then again neither did the departed the verdict is that the departed is a much more memorable film not simply because of the towering production values of a scorsese film but because its so much richer is just another thriller to me doesnt that title bother you its silly really its sum worth is an overt pun,intelligence
2004  andy lau tony leung chiu waidir wei keung lau the intriguing concept in the cops and robbers vein of a mole infesting one gang or another is always a nice attempt in breathing life into a quitefrankly creaky vehicle that is often tweaked to death with no real originalityin the latest hong kong genre buster the stakes are raised when there is a mole in the police investigating the gangland that also has a mole ie a cop has infiltrated a mob gang and vice versalau kin ming lau is a gang member who has managed for years to pass himself as an officer rising through the ranks to the point of being assigned to internal affairs in order to nab a suspected mole within the division in other words him to make matters worse the mole that is in his gang a real undercover cop chan wing yan leung chiu wai has been nearly a decade posing as a rough and tumble minion who also knows there is a secret agent amongst his staff back at hq and can only rely upon his mentor sp wong anthony wong chosang who is managing to keep the operation one step ahead with a hairbreadths width from unravelingdespite a clever concept the film quite frankly lags and drags until the final reel where things finally kick into gear with a few too many twists frankly yet i can see where the filmmakers were attempting to do a la the usual suspects and la confidential two superior noir flicks the wonky second stories involving a sexy psychiatrist and laus writer girlfriend seem tacked on and inconsequential to the proceedings at handunder whelming and not unlike chinese food the viewer is still hungry for action an hour after rumor has it martin scorsese is lining up to do an american remake possibly with matt damon and leonardo dicaprio wonder if audiences will buy the premise a second time around  ya think,intelligence
i recently picked this up off ebay thrilled to finally see a movie that had been getting rave reviews from everyone as i watched it i felt myself becoming more and more impatient thinking to myself when is this gonna impress me it never does the direction is not stylish the cinematography is boring the acting is adequate the action and suspense nonexistent the concept was great and hopefully scorsese will be able to mold it into something fresh and exciting for the remake and there were several instances where potentially hardhitting scenes were completely squandered by sentimental snatches of music ie when the guy falls on the car a trite boring bythenumbers movie that never manages to rise above its primetime relatives dont waste your time on this lapse in creativity,intelligence
audiences tend to have different standards for domestic movies and asian cinema especially hong kong and contemporary japanese films  do these asian movies have different auras  is the distinction that vast  hong kong cinema definitely has their own style somewhat uninfluenced by hollywood for that i praise them is simply not a good movie  it is a steroid paced flick from beggining to end with not an ounce of character development  there are so much trivial detail add ons  i guess this is their attempt at a story such as tony having an encounter with his ex his relationship with his therapist and the juxtaposition of andys wife writing that story  the essence of this movie have been blatantly ripped off from face off i dont think anyone can deny that sure the ending is good but that alone cant save this crap 510,intelligence
i refused to watch before the departed on the strict principle of not wanting to have anything ruined it worked for the most part and i ended up absolutely loving every minute of scorseses finally oscarwinning film but there was still a big part of me that wanted to watch affairs still just for completist sake and while it is a great movie i cannot help but think that scorseses was strongerfollowing much of the storyline of its american remake opens with a brief bit with the reputed gangster hon sam eric tsang telling his newest young recruits that they will be his eyes and ears inside the police department flash forward a bit to cadet training school where a young man named yan is chosen to be an undercover cop inside the triads while lau one of sams recruits stays behind and perfects his skills as a future officer the film then jumps far ahead into the future where yan tony leung is now one of sams most trusted men and lau andy lau is now one of the departments most respected officersfrom here anyone who knows anything about the departed can guess the catandmouse hunting game that begins between yan and lau to see who can expose who firstwhile the storyline is very much the same only with a whole lot less characters than the departed has the general feel and pace is much different the film moves quickly and is edited to the tune of a michael baystyle actioner while the film does not have a whole lot of action taking place but the intensity of the few moments that do have it make it feel like one the film jumps quickly between moments and those trying to remember when they happened in scorseses film will be a bit surprised by how early on a lot of it happens and how barely any of it is dwindled on i liked this to a point as the film never overstayed itself to the point where it became bogged down with exposition like scorseses did more than a handful of times but it also made for a whole lot less character moments and even less backstory on any character in the filmthe feel of the movie is a whole lot darker too there is next to no shady comedic undertones like scorsese had and every shocking moment becomes even more shocking here hell even the ending has an extra hint of darkness added to it in a way it enables this film to stand as its own experience and feel more unique since it was not remade exactly in scorseses filmwhat i also noticed was that a few of the surprises or pieces that the audience had to put together in the departed were all blatantly spelled out for the audience here even down to the subtitles pointing out that lau was working for sam and yan was working for the cops like i said it ruins a few of the little things that made the departed so riveting but it also allows for the film to not suffer through the same minor plot holes that the remake did this film also does away with the almost unnecessary addition of the love triangle with the psychiatrist it was the single greatest weakness in the departed and here both characters have their own female love interest it helps solve that problem but sadly takes away any real character development for either of thembut this is a problem for all of the characters in none of them really feel as developed or as threedimensional as they do in the departed yeah the same struggles are taking place and much of the same issues are taking place but they do not feel anywhere near as thoughtout as they do in the remake whether this is due to the breakneck pace or not i am unsure but a lot more could have been done to suggest what was really going on for some of these characterswhile i liked leung and lau in their roles i feel the exact same way i did after watching the departed leung does a great job as the slowly deteriorating yan and brings a lot of messy emotions to the screen at once you can see just how much the undercover role is taking out of him and just how badly he wants out lau however gives the much greater performance he is cold menacing and uneasy all at once he has a very solid unwavering presence about him and even at the worst of times never shows the same fear that grips matt damons counterpart in the remake while i did like damon better the first time i saw the departed subsequent watchings have diminished the impact his character made the first time i can only hope that laus brilliantly reserved performance will stay just as strong when i watch the film againsupporting turns from tsung and anthony wong as sp wong the only man who knows yans true identity are fairly well done despite being very important characters in the grand scheme of things both have very little time to truly prove themselves on screen tsung does a better job here but these two are probably who could have done with a lot more exposition they also lack same edginess that complemented jack nicholson and martin sheen in the remake but they are well done nonethelesson the whole is a welldone film that was done even better in the departed it is a worthy watch for laus magnificent performance and to see how the remake could have corrected itself it is a solid piece of filmmaking that could have done with a few improvements but is a worthy watch for anyone who loved scorseses film710,intelligence
i watched departed long ago and after long time i decided to finally watch i think its a well paced movie the departed was little too long but i liked the departed a little more female characters are insignificant in this movie i loved the little plot twist at the end in the departed nevertheless this movie is a great crime drama with magnificent actors playing their best,intelligence
this is an enthralling and riveting crime movie that is thrilling from beginning to end there is investigation and quite a bit of mobster talk but its fast paced and for the most part gets to the point i remember watching this for the first time in theaters and was blown away at how cool and clever the execution was the plot revolves around a ballsy undercover gangster that is basically a mole within the triad gang and a cunning and meticulous triad gang member that is a mole in the intelligence on the other side and how they are trying to figure out each sides plans and sniff each other out before time runs out its actually a clever premise and executed quite well i really enjoyed the cat and mouse premise in this with each side trying to track down the mole on the other side while trying to outthink one another its not a action packed hong kong thriller but its a thriller with a lot of clever elements this is a engaging film from start to finish and its a film that i want to watch again later down the line its basically a cult classic from china and for good reasons that i can highly recommend9310,intelligence
i know im against the common opinions here however despite i found the movie intriguing with a engaging plot i found it really not too exciting and thrilling because a few problemsthe most important part of a movie is without doubts the plot and this one has a great one that said some parallel stories have no depth and arent developed at all but mostly and especially seem there was not a exactly striking edit and a flawless execution a very good thriller but the current rating despite its undoubted merits being too high could let someone slight disappointed710,intelligence
is a film that has its roots in hong kongs historical and political background and once this is understood it adds many depths to the film this play on double identity and going undercover is related to how the people of hong kong struggle to find an identity as hong konger as past colonial powers and the oppressive presence of china have large influences in hindering the formulation of their own identitythe acting is pretty great in this andy lau has established himself as a very famous actor and singer his acting is pretty good but i kind of feel that his face gives off a pretty innocent and childlike aura tony leung does a great job and the film centralizes on him a little bit more i feel we identify with him as he struggles to gain his identity back and the use of close ups of his facial expressions really convey his characters emotions anthony wong and eric tsang also do a good job with their respective partsthe cinematography and editing are also pretty impressive i really liked how they juxtaposed the younger versions of the two protagonists with their older selves at the end that was cool the many rooftop scenes are interesting as well with fantastic shooting of the reflections in the skyscrapersi also found the story to be very engaging of course undercover cops arent anything new but they arent so common plus there are two undercover characters and that makes the action twice as engaging also since the film is heavily rooted in the countrys background that gives a local feel to it while still opening its doors to the international public it has been remade into a hollywood film called the departed even though i have not watched the hollywood remake just by watching the trailer i know it will give off a totally different feel i personally think the original will be better since then tension in this film is spoton while hollywood just makes everything mostly into a swearing bloody battlemy only critique is that the film jumps around sometimes from different timelines or in different spaces and that can be confusing the story drifted a bit at times too and there are instances in which events that occurred were questionableoverall an engaging film with great acting cinematography and editingread more movie reviews at championangelswordpresscom,intelligence
andy lau and tony leung are two giants in asian cinema and they play opposites in this cop thriller which pits two moles against each other in a complex hierarchy of modern hong kong they are extremely prolific actors because they are capable which is disappointing because the direction doesnt always allow for them to emote and fully display the gravity of their situation when superintendent wongs lifeless body hurtles down onto the streets the score instantly turns sentimental and we are treated to black and white flashbacks of their previous scenes of that connection to chans old life instantly severed but we must be emotionally manipulated into feeling this when laus girlfriend discusses her novels main characters morality the score again turns from the tense percussion of the earlier scenes to this soft sentimental piano piece her description of this character who is supposedly a good person but who does bad things is so painfully unsubtle that it takes away from this great script theres an early scene that allows lau and leung to display their talent one that is not in scorseses departed a simple occurrence of a man buying a stereo allows us to roughly gauge what sort of person chan is before revealing he in fact works for the mob and that stereo of course returns with significantly more important implications many of the segments of the script were directly lifted for departed and that is an indication of their importance and their effectiveness the thematic narrative is just as effective in dreary and gritty hong kong as it is in the irish catholic underbelly of boston theres the drug deal that is monitored from both sides the respective moles relaying information that is delicately balanced and edited its a tense scene which the score better services a heavy percussion backing over this plucked riff that seems strangely egyptian but it works the tragic climax is also pretty much the same with the unveiling of the secondary rat in the police department and this execution from lau to tie up all lose ends and maintain his cover i am intrigued by one of scorseses additions in making the mob boss a corrupt informant himself eric tsang plays the triad leader in and is unfortunately miscast as he is a primarily comedic actor too short and too jovial to really be menacing although the breaking of the cast was a great moment which also served as a red herring of sorts when lau executes his former boss here its the culmination of his continued undercover life and realising that perhaps this act will lead to a promotion and a more comfortable life henceforth when damon does so in departed its because he discovers that the man he is working for is in turn crooked and his entire lifes work and philosophy collapses onto itself both work just as well as do their respective fates although nicholson proves to be the difference we feel saddened by the tragic end of chan and the various ways in which his identity breaks down bit by bit there is a flashback again as he discovers that lau is the mole but this one is integral and provides us with even more tension script is a great one and an original one even if its direction and visualisation is not entirely subtle i am reminded of some better scenes in the film which utilise secondary characters that are not laus placeholder girlfriend to reinforce those themes of identity morality and agency as well as those buddhist sentiments of rejecting destiny and fate introduced in the beginning are we really who we are if we cease to act in that way chan runs into an ex girlfriend while going for a massage an inexplicable encounter but her face shows only hints of recognition she comforts her young daughter and talks of her marriage things that are infinitely out of reach for chan later he is the sole person who witnesses the other moles death keung in a dramatic scene where the actors face is visibly melting with condensation and he speaks on edge it might be clich to have someone utter such a confession before they die but its emotionally moving because of the effective performance of that monologue the yearning for a normal life that is mirrored in chans expression in that penultimate meeting in the office we agonise over the simple press of a button that erases a mans entire life we know that chans life is over a fact that he never is confronted with perhaps it is better that waythese moments are frustrating because they point to what could have been a great film if not for those overdramatic death scenes blatantly unsubtle exposition and unnecessary black and white flashbacks that connect the dots for the viewer as if they were a child at that policemans funeral a teary sumyee whispers to no one but the audience that she will dream of chan just as he dreamt of her in those therapy sessions where they fell in love is this really necessary but in saying that we feel the same way for this fallen policeman,intelligence
the inspiration behind scorseses oscarwinning the departed this hong kong original contains the core fabric of that story but few of its offshoots its strictly the tale of two doubleagents working both sides of the law in a desperate race to be the last man discovered as the stakes climb steep and swift rapid and concise it speeds impressively through some very tricky waters effectively ratcheting the tension to an almostunbearable level through both plot and cinematography as a nonmandarin speaker its often tough to keep pace with the lightningquick subtitles but strong performances from the two yinandyang leads saves the day on more than one occasion ballsy and coldhearted i wish the american adaptation hadnt spoiled so many of the twists for me i have a hunch the ending wouldve been twice as jolting if it hadnt,intelligence

is one of those rare movies that grips you from the start to finish the tightfocused story and a fantastic background score make for an exhilarating moviewatching experience and the tension on the screen is almost palpable the romantic plotline with the psychiatrist was probably the weakest link in an otherwise extraordinary film to me personally this movie surpasses the departed its american remake in that there is a much stronger emotional connection with the two lead characters played superbly by andy lau and tony leung chiu wai here unlike departed whose execution while felt clinical was nevertheless cold and detached while laus character is the obvious bad guy i still could not help but root for him too and this speaks volumes about the level of humanness that lau brings to the role of such a flawed character overall this ranks among the very best hk films and indeed among the greatest crimethrillers ever made,intelligence

for years i was told by a mate you watch foreign films i think he actually said anything you need to check out then of course not long after the american remake was announced which i went and watched and enjoyed as the departed  much to the distress of said friendanyway i was actually looking for a better tomorrow in the asian film section of the video shop nowhere to be found as usual so when i came across this i thought why not the verdict speaking frankly is that if youve seen either the departed or you dont really need to see the other they are so similar in plot that i knew exactly what was coming up most of the time and both are quite good filmsi can only compare it to a musician releasing an album of original work and another equally talented taking the album and faithfully remaking it just with their instruments and voice there was no real point but most consumers would likely embrace the first version they heard put briefly the departed is very far removed from the shot for shot psycho remakebut this isnt a the departed reviewis set in hong kong and opens with an induction of sorts a group of police cadets are briefly introduced and then almost immediately we cut to about 10 years later when one of the more promising cadets yan has been expelled from the force and works in the chinese underground crime world we know it is 10 years later because he has grown a mustache the best remaining cadet has enjoyed a solid and decorated career and has advanced to the rank of inspector his name is launow heres the hook and without this there really isnt a film the criminal guy yan is actually a good guy who is working undercover for the police and answers to only one member of the force the expulsion was just to cover his exit and justify him turning to crime and inspector lau is actually a crooked cop who filters information to a local gangland boss called sam who happens to be yans employer of sortsso there we have it dueling rats one of them a goodbad guy and the other a badgood guy it is an intriguing concept and the filmmakers utilise it well so that frequently we feel that they will finally meet or one will catch the other but it is never kept that simplethe crisis point is when an international drug deal goes bad as both stoolies try to inform their respective links and understandably things get very confusing for both the police and the criminals both who feel they should have the inside scoop but are continually being second guessed by the enemy it becomes evident to both bosses that there is a mole working for them and as they each know that they already have a man on the inside they sic their respective rat to find their counterpartconfused yet it is actually paced well so that you can track the action pretty wellbut it goes further inspector lau is actually called in to work for the internal affairs department in essence to look for himself all the while as he is trying to use his contacts to track down yan for gangland boss samin an attempt to catch yan in a rendezvous with the police chief things go wrong and the chief is killed as he was the only link between yan and the police yan is now in the unenviable position of extricating himself from a situation that noone knows he is in but himself as all the while the nets close indoes he do it well youll have to shill your 2 for the weekly i will say it is worth the ride there are strong visuals the director has a pretty striking style and of course given the explanation above there are ingenious plot twists throughouti was actually surprised as to how complete this film was  not that i am prejudiced against foreign films  far from it but the departed was frequently described as being a success due to scorceses vision not because it was a remake of an equally intricate workas far as the differences between this and the departed there are subtle differences but more because the departed was a 150 minute beast and is a lean mean 90 odd the departed took what i would argue were minor subplots in the hk original and expanded them so that they became more a part of the remake but from memory none of them added greatly to the finished film there were some more memorable characters in the departed aside from the gang boss sam noone stands out from yan as a solid character but that could be as much about me having to read their dialogue on the screen as a foreign viewer and not really getting any difference or power in their performancethis was followed by a couple of sequels that i am yet to see but i may look up in coming months i would be interested in seeing how they could incorporate the final scenes into any follow upfinal rating  75  10 if you love the departed this is so similar that it is unlikely to sway you but if have seen neither and like foreign films this is a solid one with an intricate but worthwhile plot patience and attention will be rewardedif you liked this review or even if you didnt check out oneguyramblingcom,intelligence
ive watched many undercover cop movies in recent times and this is the best ive seen its 2010 and its the first time ive seen this movie which should be a sin i love the way everything ties into the buddhist saying about the 8th hell the ending was just amazing and well thought out truly made a very good movie outstanding the performances are amazing and even the smallest roles like the psychologist are really memorable the police inspector wong is also played brilliantly not overplayed but very believable and really gets a very emotional response from the audience tony leung and andy lau are amazing actors they are extremely believable in their roles andy laus girlfriend is also great and also evokes a very emotional response from the audience all in all the best undercover cop movie ive seen such a breath of fresh air and if you havent watched it yet please do yourself a favour and do so,intelligence
and im not just talking about asian movies but worldwide this is my cup of tea a good amount of action a noncheesy story and stellar actingnot to mention the eyecandies that are tony leung and andy lau what really standsout in this movie for me is the death scenes i know anyone who has watched this movie will agree with me it has oneor make that two of the best death scenes youve seen in a film very welldone you see an awardwinning acting with the facial expression you cant help but go awww lol a good angle of the scene a sentimental background music some flashbacks in black and white and wooh there goes an excellent movie baby i cant even decide which one brought me closer to tears tony leungs or anthony wongs death scene both are highlights of the film something that will leave your mind blank i have to admit i didnt get the story at first but as the story goes i have come to understand it i gave this movie a 1010 having said that this movie is much better than the departed imho wellwritten welldirected i cant highly recommend it more,intelligence
is a movie not to be missedit has everything loyalty of a cophonor of a cop  a betrayal of a copthis movies about finding an informer in each the mafia as well as the policeeach have their own informer in the oppositethe main crux is that who finds out that who is the betrayerthe casting is quite good though i am not aware of who were the actors and allbut i saw this movie with subtitlesthis ones very goodeven better than the departedthis is a great cop thrillernot to be missed for surethe ending is just so fascinatingtakes you back to the time where you could have taken the right decisionsafter letters from iwo jima  the heroboth being foreign filmsthis is the best i have seenoscar worthy,intelligence
a brilliant asian extreme film in my view the franchise is known for its titles being based around subjects in the world that are dark these being crime murder cold calculated violence and just chaotic death this film is one of the titles of this franchise that is good and not overly action or violent the plot is easy to understand so for all you action junkies you still get your daily dose but what is good about this film is that it is the same material that influenced the making of the departed so it is a great piece of asian dramaactionthere is some great acting from the part of the cast action setpieces are also well done and of course the pace is well set do not push this aside simply because you have seen the departed this is what started it all both the future ia 2 and 3 as well as the departed,intelligence
by now the story is famous thanks in america to scorseses adaptation the departed the premise is so simple and so effective that its amazing that they havent been making movies like this for years or maybe they have but definitely none have been as well done as thisthe story involves a brilliant mirror image in the crime and law enforcement world  the police force assigns a promising new recruit to enter the crime world and live there for years as a mole meanwhile a crime boss has assigned a young gangster to join the police academy and become a legitimate cop living inside the force for years as a molei watched at the same time as i was reading a thick biography of chairman mao and while living in china so ive been reading a lot about undercover moles and their seemingly endless use throughout modern chinese history and this movie gives a brilliant on screen example the development of the plot and story are by far the most interesting thing about the movie lau is the mobster living as a police officer and chan is the police recruit living undercover as a criminal lau is flourishing as a policeman while chan is growing increasingly desperate as a criminal since as the years pass he finds that he is more and more simply becoming the role he is playing and he grows increasingly desperate to get out unfortunately the force has invested years in him as a criminal so they refuse to let him outbefore long a mole is suspected in the force and sure enough lau the mole himself is assigned to find it this puts him in a curious position he can either continue to fail to find the mole or he can frame one of his colleagues soon both characters are aware of each other but not each others identity and there is a lengthy use of cellphones to create a complex web of tension as each is on the verge of discovering the identity of the other or get discovered himself a more thorough and effective recipe for genuine tension is difficult to come bythen there is the issue of each man playing a different identity for so long there is a deeper emotional and moral complexity to this film than most crime films american chinese or otherwise its a brilliant composition of dichotomies and contradictions mirror images and switches personalities and makes for a hell of a ride,intelligence
was the first hong kong movie i have ever watched and is simply better then most american copgangster moviesa triad soldier is placed into the police force by his boss and begins to rise through the ranks at the same time a police cadet is placed into the chinese tiads as a undercoverand so it beginsthe undercover triad must be one step ahead of the police and inform his triad boss on any evidence or possible witnesses basically keep him safe while the undercover cop must find evidence to bring down the triad bossandy lau shines in this film as the cunning and clever triadcop while tony leung plays the frustrated and confused coptriadthe film keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and keeps them watching it has a few ironic moments when both meet at the stereo storea great film for a first time viewer of hong kong cinema,intelligence
one cannot relate all the superlatives of this film without the risk of missing something this is the film the departed wanted to be when they tried to duplicate it  they didnt come closefelix chong and siu fai mak wrote this incredible story of and undercover cop in the mob and an undercover mobster on the police force andy lau directors wai keung lau and siu fai mak again did not waste one second of the hour and a half that this story runsthe sound was superlative the art direction cinematography music visual effects and editing were top notch and the action choreography was the equal of any chinese action film  just breathtaking and then there is tony leung jet lis hero hard boiled as yan and anthony wong as sp wong what could you possibly say that hasnt been said in the over 100 reviews of their performances if you liked the departed then check out the original you will not be disappointed,intelligence
internal affairs is a riveting and unpredictable cop drama from directors wai keung lau and siu fai mak that grips the viewer from its unconventional start and doesnt let go until the end titles have rolleda mole in the police force is mirrored by an undercover cop who has successfully infiltrated the local mafia the two characters will soon find themselves on a deadly collision course as they discover each others identitiesstylish wellwritten beautifully shot and directed this thriller is unmissable the cast are excellent and the female stars are stunning9 out of 10 a genuine treat,intelligence
a triad mole andy lau in who has infiltrated the police department has to find a undercover cop tony leung whos deep in the triad and vice versa in this superb film from wai keung lau and siu fai mak of course now that the american remake is out its impossible not to compare the two but i feel that they each can pretty much stand on their own merits the actings great in both while the remake clearly wins in the violence and glossy shine departments it also leaves out a lot of the emotional layers and complexities of this one i love both movies equally and am hard pressed to pick one over the other however i will say that this original has the better ending absolutely followed by a prequel and sequel neither of which ive seen as of yet but i have part 2 geared up in the dvd player as i write thismy grade a,intelligence
this is the first time i have rented a film that was an action film that was foreign i expected it to be good thriller to watch while on the treadmill what distinguishes this story about two adversaries one a mole working for the mob the other a mole working for the police is the soulful acting and underlying theme of the story the writing and direction is excellent and you forget very quickly your watching something from another culture and in a different language the suspense is wound tight throughout the film and is totally credible thanks to the excellent acting the music is very effective as well and gave a very western feel to this movie this is one movie i would rate as a must see and ranks among the best cop thrillers i have ever seen,intelligence
i will not review this film as such but i will advise you to watch it is a film that incorporates clever story telling character development and a complete plot the story itself is very original which is why brad pitt bought the rights for this film at cannes when it was 1st viewed the film itself is delivered with immense execution the sense of realism and intensity is perfectly portrayed and clustered into an outstanding movie this is the type of film that makes reading subtitles worth it as agreed by non chinese friends at first i thought that hk would be biased towards this film as the cast is all alist however this is also an emotional and tense epic feature it contains themes of loyalty and sets on an edge of your seat pace its has a very cool and sophisticated atmosphere that remains consistent until the credits appear truly superb triad drama,intelligence
us one of the best crime dramas not only out of asia but anywhere in the world with great star performances by andy lau and tony leung this is the story of two men one a cop who is a mole in the gang of a drug lord and the other a mole in the police working for the drug lord it shows the toll that takes place on these two guys as both sides are trying to find the moles i also like the fact that even though these two actors are stars in hong kong they are not afraid to play the bad guy and get a little dirty you will never see harrison ford in a role like this for example i will not give away the ending but it did surprise me that it ended the way it did this film is definitely worth watching,intelligence
this movie ranks as one of the best hong kong movie ive ever seen and trust me ive seen a lotthese days it is not rare for hk movies to have a reasonably big budget and this ones no exception big budgets doesnt necessarily mean good movie though a recent example  just look at huadu chronicles or twin effect ii where a lot of hk movies fail miserably is a weak plot sometimes its a cookie cutter from a certain hollywood or japanese movie sometimes its just plain weak and thats exactly where this movie excels a strong and a very smart plot its not easily to outsmart the movie audience these days but this movies got one of the smartest plot ive ever seen since running out of time aau chin 1999where this movie does even better than aau chin is the plot brings a severe crash of characters among the good and evil within every character theres no black and white in this movie almost every character has a good side and a dark side the entire movie evolves around crashing of good and evil and the good among the bads and the bad among the goods the setting of the plot is kindda a doublespy movie where the cops got an undercover cop in the triad and the triads got an undercover guy inside the police both sides are trying to find out who that undercover guy is while the cops try to arrest one of the biggest triads in hkthe plot is not without flaw  spoiler many question why inspector chan tony leung didnt disclose laus andy lau identity after laus reactivated his policeman identity i have the same questionbut the acting you get in this movie is amazing tony leung gives you the usual superb acting and theres no doubt he gets the character with the most conflicting personality in this movie its too bad andy lau had to go head to head against tony leung in this movie cos it easily shows whos the better actor between the 2 lau delivers a surprisingly good performance in this movie though i still think lau suffers from the showcasing im a superstar syndrome in this movie but its a lot more subtle than how he performs in some other movies other than the 2 main casts you also get superb acting performance from wong chausung and tsang chiwai to wrap it up this is one of the best hk movies ive ever seen if you havent seen it yet dont miss it as for the sequels  i think ii is a decent follow up to this movie while the iii is a waste of time compared to the first movie,intelligence
great movie in the same league as michael manns heat but it does not outheat him as the tagline on the dvdbox suggests on the other hand this movie brings back the exciting and exotic feeling of the first john woo films a word of advice to martin scorsese whos named as the director to make an american remake forget about matt damon one of americas worst and most boring actors and leonardo dicaprio a fat hasbeen these days it would be an offence to the great original movie to cast actors like them in the main roles forget about the boxoffice marty just make a good movie i suggest actors like edward norton ant tim roth for the main roles and for example al pacino as the police captain or the main hood,intelligence
enjoyed this well paced crime thriller but two elements irritated me first when chan the undercover cop  goes to meet sp wong on top of the building we learn after this shocking scene that wong was captured on the cctv  why did they not catch chan as he entered the building in the same way second irritant concerned the motivation of lau who is the gang mole among the cops  without giving anything away there is little we learn during the movie that might lead him to reconsider to which side his loyalties might lie for me this lack of psychological development weakened the overall story  would welcome other viewers comments on this aspect recommend this movie but not going to rush to see the hollywood remakerating 8 out of 10owen sheffield uk,intelligence
there are themes resonant of heat and donnie braso but this is in no way derivative it is a tightly paced reflection on role and identity and the existential pain of concealmentthe acting is excellent and the photography more so if there is a problem it is that the symmetries of the plot are a bit too neat and the use of the female characters to underline the situation of the leads rather too facilehowever that said i was gripped for the whole of my trip to the cinema and although i suspect that this film would lose less that some in viewing on tv screen the use of exteriors is good enough to justify a walk in the coldi see that hollywood want to remake it sad  people should go and see the original,intelligence
i think this is such a fantastic film from hong kong its probably the best of the movies about the triad theres nothing simple about the plot its suspense all the way its just like this whole cat and mouse tension that has you so intrigued,intelligence
i was drawn into this movie as soon as it started until the ending in the beginning two lead characters appear by different actors and soon change to andy lau and tony leung but after that the plot is simple and strongandy laus acting is most impressive the expression on his face gives this movie a tension and color the process laus internal struggle grows through coping with yan could be described much deeper if the lines are more carefully elaborated there were two points i could not understand well 1 what is the role of yans former girlfriend who knew her in the police when yan was honored as a police hero was she recorded as his wife 2 in the beginning sam brings his freshmen to a temple where he gives them instruction is it only lau who was ordered to infiltrate to the police b says he was sent by sam almost the same time didnt lau know it,intelligence
this is one good show that kept me awake the whole time  not only good casting decisions were made andy lau vs tony leung it just simply had the right amount of edge to it  for most cantoncrime dramas they usually end up having a lot of cheese and bad sex scenes  but here i thought it is just simply elegant  another reason why i enjoyed it so much is because it is just 90 min  just the fact that it is so concise made it exciting  which is what crime movies should be  fast pace to keep the viewer thinking fast with the exception of several great crime movieshows namely the godfather howeverwhat really bugs me is its intro credits thingyfor awhile i thought i was going to watch a scifi flick  whats with that,intelligence
the very first time i heard about the plot is was like whoa it is one of those cleaver twist that i havent seen make into movie since faceoffan undercover cop in triad and an undercover triad as a cop tony leung play the rookie cop send to join hk triad as an undercover and the supposedly short assignment turns into a lifetime work while andy lau was the gangster sent to the police academy and gradually becomes a high rating officeracting wise it is very satisfying considered this is not art house and not wong kar wai movie i know anthony wong and eric tsang make lots of crap  as tons of other talented hk actors but i always believe they are the real deal in this movie they just prove it all a solid performance in all department maybe sammy chen is a misscast but she only appear about 10min so it do no harm to this masterpiece this is in no doubt the smartest movie come out of hk since running out of time,intelligence
is a decent hong kong film i havent really enjoyed a good hong kong film for sometime i had found them to be distasteful for a period of time and this film returned my confidence in hong kong filmsthe story isnt very original but nowadays its very hard to find an original crime drama the actors gave solid performances though i wouldnt really say its their best i cant really tell you know andy lau always seems to be the same and tony leung well i am just too familiar with this guy the music is all right but not very impressive and the cinematography seems average to me but its good entertainment if youve got two hours to spare and are a fan of hong kong films or at least want to see a hong kong film 8 out of 10,intelligence
i was genuinely surprised the story was fantastic the plot twists were very unexpected but certain leung chia wai wong chau sau and  tsiang chi wai are good as always but lau takwah was exceptional this has to be one of his best recent performance he did with experience grace and emotion my only complaints are there unusual plot holes and the usage of the actresses otherwise a fantastic movie9910,intelligence
the perfect example of the resurrection of hong kong cinema as the innovative and exciting way of making movies we used to love in the 80s and early 90sis a thrilling combination of the style and guts of those days with the best spirit of american 40s noir and 60s70s french polar as a matter of fact andy laus and tony leungs chemistry on screen reminded me the performances of unforgettable duos such us alain delon and gian maria volont in le cercle rouge,intelligence
the acting is superb  i give this movie 910there are actually two released versions of this movie  one is hk cantonese the other in mandarinfrom reading the comments most people have seen the hk version  i have seen both  and in my opinion i like the ending in the mandarin version better,intelligence
with the recent popularity of the martial arts movie is a refreshing slice of police drama that deserves more attention gangster films of old the better tommorrows or the young and dangerous series seem to be distant memory and the eastern cinema that prolifrates our market in the west is the kung fu flick layden with bile enducing special effects or the recent spate of eerie horrors waiting in the wings for their predestined hollywood remake which will ultimately tarnish their otherwise impecable repetations but now hollywood is turning its sights on to the respected output of the east its crime thrillers is not an untouchable work of genius it has holes like any narrative but it is a superb example of what the east can produce with a modecome of self restraint no special effects no slowmo gunplay in fact most of the violence is played out of scene but still within earshot these people live in the information era they have lifes and lies deception is the game this is just solid drama played out by solid performances anthony wong is understated and coolat times you still want to see him explode as in beast cops or bunman tony leung is his usual mean and moody self and but it is andy laus performance that really shines a powerhouse performance underneath such a cool exterior youll be lucky to see him flinch yet he protrays such intensity constantly he plays his cards close to his chest caught up and confused losing himself in the facade he has created truly excellent so we hear of a remake in the offering brad pitts name attached may be okay then again well if they destroy this like they did to john woo tsui hark chow yun fat that horrorible ring remake jackie chan jet li and countless others there may be an undercover agent infiltrating hollywood out to whack a few head honchos,intelligence
what a twist what a cast what a conflictthis is one of the best andrew laus pieces a culmination of the whole young and dangerous seriesits no bangbangbang flick but thinkthinkthinkits no lookatmeimhandsome show but lookatmeimindilemmaandy laus acting is surprisingly mature while tony leungs as fantastic as usual i love the idea to cast young stars edison chen and shawn yu as the juniors of the two megastars with no doubt they are the next big things in hong kong film industryalso its cool to cast the funnyfaced eric tsang as the godfather while bad guy anthony wong as the cop leader with a fatherly heart this strengthen the concept of the whole movie that is blackvswhite with the confusion which is black and which is whitebig fans of hong kong action flicks will die rotten in hell if they miss this one,intelligence
it is in my opinion that what makes this aboveaverage film the more watchable one among other hong kong flicks is that there were 2 instead of 1 director i would say good acting is involved on both andy and tony the same goes with the other actors there is a fair amount of character development story line is cohesive flows well and easy to comprehend the conclusion of the film may come as a sort of twist to viewers and that is what makes the film a higher rating it deserves definitely worth watching,intelligence
its really a once in a blue moon these days when you get to see a hong kong movie that has two topbilling heartthrob actors who have been and still gracing the hong kong silver screen thats what you would be expecting in or in chinese  wu jian dao which boasts a starstudded cast that includes sammi cheng kelly chan edison chan eric tsang shawn yu and anthony wong chau sang however the two whom i mentioned earlier are of course andy lau and tony leung chiu wai who are the main story line builders of this moviethe movie is about yan tony leung chiu wai who is a police undercover in the triads while ming andy lau is in the reversal of a triad undercover in the police department leading parallel but opposite lives both feel the tremendous pressure as well as stressfully trapped in their false and increasing dangerous surroundings both have been walking on the thin fatal line until on one fateful evening they finally meet each other on the other hand both the police and the triads have knowledge that theres an undercover amongst them and the chase is on as they compete who would dig out their mole firstif you felt a similarity sort of characters plot in this movie then you would have to recall an early 90s release called dont fool me which incidentally also starred both andy lau and tony leung chiu wai as well as anthony wong too in dont both also switched and reversed their character roles too however dont get me wrong as both movies have totally no connections somehow or rather i just feel peculiar as why the two actors cant have a totally fresh movie story line to perform whenever they are cast together anyway provided an opportunity for a happy reunion of the 2 heartthrob actors cum oldtime buddies for their fans and viewers to catch a glimpse of how much they have matured since the video days of the duke of mount deerthe realistic of the movie aside overall the story of the movie is quite unusual as well as unexpected too well these days movie buffs just cant expect for total perfection so what else to ask for when you have such a heavyweight load of casts in a single movie for this coming seasons greetings,intelligence

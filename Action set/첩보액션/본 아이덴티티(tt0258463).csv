i have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like bond or the juvenile stunt exhibition triple x there have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candybesides ronin is the only other recent spy movie i can think of that didnt feature skydiving bungie jumping skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys laser pens cars with ejection seats or silicone breasted women with names youd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowdwhile bourne does not have a particularly deep plot it is consistent and focused the focus is entirely upon bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past being hunted without knowing why some people have complained about being confused by the movie i for one do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information if you cant handle a little of that you probably should stick to disney films or tvs scooby doo where everything is explained in the end we never find out about what is in the case in ronin and i can live without some information being filled in about bournes pastto those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie seek help there are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences as i remember i liked the book and i definitely like this movie i view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anywayas for realism most of the action scenes are believable no supergadgets are to be seen no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with bourne and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance as someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve the fights in bourne are fast nasty and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman and yes taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable though i had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years agowhile not being perfect is simply put several grades above the typical spy film being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale the mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for bourne than us and i think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends the implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre,intelligence
james bond and ethan hunt take notice is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers  gone or almost gone are the special effects that james and ethan rely on all too heavily hell in those franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters has a very straightforward story to tell a mystery that slowly unravels spycraft is not all about technical gizmos but requires human brains and human brawn and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases set in various locales in switzerland and france during the winter much of the visuals for are gray and damp thats a plus monte carlo and like locales can get boring mat damon is great as jason bourne fished from the mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds a total amnesiac he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a welltrained assassin and that someone is out to kill him franka potente is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run with him run or be killedi cant say enough good things about this movie doug limon thanks you did a great job,intelligence
what if you had lost your memory and learned the cia is out to terminate you because you know too much thats the question matt damons superspy jason bourne wants to know and it could cost him his life in the starring role matt damon is perfectly cast as the charming and lethal secret agent on the hunt to find out who he is mastering different martial arts styles and weapons training in addition to several foreign languages damon is a force when he takes the screen as bourne the films action is endless as bourne is chased around europe by assassins of the secret he is out to discover from car chases in snowy germany to hiding out in the lovely european countryside and ending finally in the city of lights paris france the films fight scene are just engrossing as bourne gains the upper hand each time due to his special combat skills he rarely uses a weapon unless its needed to finish the job and incapacitate his opponentthe storyline is solid though it heavily deviates from author robert ludlums novel however the premise is intact as the film covers jason bournes start on the path to find out who he is,intelligence
i was pleasantly surprised with very rarely do i get to watch a movie that surpasses my expectationsfirst of all can i say that there are so many films out there that have the same regurgitated ideas and plot linesnot many of which have any originalitythis however is one of the exceptions thankfully and pleasantlycentred around a man who gets washed ashore and with no memory ok so this has been done before  but this movie was originala selection box of mystery action and great acting by all concernedhavent seen much of mr damion i have to admit but he was impressivethe photography  can i use that term without sounding like a theatre studies student  was very goodin fact watching this movie was like watching one of those middle of the night foreign movies in a funny sort of wayhowever this was much morein a word this film was originalwell directed and well acted good to see a film that doesnt have to rely on spectacular special effects and painted backdropsthis film worked because it worked without any of that now i am waffling,intelligence
this story has been done several times in the past most recently in a long kiss goodnight its also true that doug liman and the producers created their own jason bourne mythologysince this movie is different in many ways to the book but the truth is liman takes an old story and puts a new fast paced spin on itmatt damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out who he is as he travels from city to city hes followed by cia agents who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs hes helped along the way by marie played by the brilliant franka potente together they come face to face with the people that want them deadthe cast is great and so is the story this film should be on everyones top ten list,intelligence
next to ronin this is one of the best action  spy movies that ive ever seen i heard a lot of good critics but didnt know what to think about it i only saw it 2 years after it first appeared and im a little disappointed that i didnt go watch it in the cinemaim not too keen on movies like james bond and other stuff in this genre but this one is a lot better normally you see the super hero using all kinds of weird gadgets driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal womenjason bourne however doesnt have all this things which makes this movie a lot more realistic the fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining the action scenes are believable no supergadgets no incredibly willing women sharing his bed our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence in the meanwhile he has to deal with amnesia while being hunted without knowing why in the end this is still a man which you can identify yourself withi would say go watch it when you are a fan of movies like ronin dont watch it if you think james bond is a person who you can bump into on the streets when going out personally i would award this movie with an 810,intelligence
jason bourne matt damon is a highly trained assassin found left for dead at sea he wakes to find he has no memory of who he is and he needs answers fast if he is to survive the attempts to erase his existenceis excellently paced and brings a great deal of realism to the spy genre the fight sequences are fast and believable the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of jason bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify withmatt damon plays the role with apparent ease he simply slips into the character and brings him to life as spy thrillers go one of the best around810,intelligence
maybe its me but it gives me a familiar feeling when i see a guy in a turtleneck sweater an overcoat and a rifle  i know its a cliche but why would this movie reinvent the medium anyway i also like car chases through foreign cities passports and accents  so with all that intact i liked very much  it has all the elements of the genre  you know what youre getting and you get what you want there is no point in going over the plot  it gets confusing about 34 in but it does not matter that much  its fun for two hours and thats iti have been a huge fan of franka potente since becoming mildly obsessed with run lola run and she does not disappoint  she has some real chemistry with matt damon and has a very sweet inviting way about her  she is not traditional leading actress material thank god and i credit the producers for hiring her  even more so when you realize that julia stiles has a small part in this movie  i am sure someone wanted a bigger name to be matts female lead and it might have occured to more than one exec to switch franka and julia but obviously i am glad that did not happenclive owen adds another strong performance to his resume  he has only one big scene really but makes the most of it  chris cooper and brian cox are known for their sturdy work and they also deliver hereexcellent summertime entertainment  810,intelligence
i can sympathize with reviewers who had read the book and were disappointed by this film and the liberties it apparently took with the story ive had that happen with books ive enjoyed and it can spoil a film you might otherwise have liked i never read the book so i was able to appreciate this film on its own merits  slick tough fastpaced and refreshingly devoid of the kind of nonsense that has made the bond films harder and harder to sit through im especially impressed by the fights which as other reviewers have pointed out are among the most believable martialartsbased fight scenes ever seen no big grand gestures or olympian kicks  just fast nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effortthe cast is uniformly good  even damon who is no fave of mine comes across believably as a man whos trained to hold it all in but isnt sure what it all is that hes holding in cooper cox and owen shine in their alltoobrief screen time potente is attractive in a real person sort of way sigh of relief for this genre and possesses an inner strength that makes her characters actions and reactions ring truer than what wed get from the traditional hollywood eyecandy girlfriend these films normally featurefrom the gritty bowels of the trawler where damon awakens to his situation to the field where he confronts his most deadly assailant the locations are the antithesis of the travel poster hotspots that bond so frequently visits despite its breakneck pace handled so well by liman and so poorly in the sequel by his protg the film manages to convey a sense of melancholy that lifts it a bit above the average action thriller sorry book fans  it may not be your cup of ludlum but its still a damn fine little action flick,intelligence
this is a great movie unfortunately one reviewer has no knowledge towards the field of psychology one reviewer states its a good movie based on a completely false occurrence that being amnesia in general they say it doesnt exist and nobody loses their memory of their identity while retaining knowledge of everything else this is untrue i am currently studying to become a psychologist its called dissociative amnesia dissociative amnesia  formerly psychogenic amnesia is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal information this disorder is characterized by a blocking out of critical personal information dissociative amnesia unlike other types of amnesia does not result from other medical trauma such as a blow to the head the predominant disturbance is one or more episodes of inability to recall important personal information usually of a traumatic or stressful nature that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness  just to prove its true and does happen so this movie is not based on something made up similar losses of memory do happen to people especially people in a job such as that so concluding this is a great action film i truly enjoyed this movie along with the sequel the bourne supremacy both are i think going to be a couple of the best movies we will see this decade 20002010,intelligence
while the action genre is as believable and formulaic as an nsync song takes a much needed step to the side to watch oncoming traffic subtle yet still holding true to multiple action formulas lots of fighting cool weaponry and chase scenes this film presents a new era of action film making which could be all the wave matt damon who has the unfortunate nature of watching his less talented friend ben affleck gain notoriety for trash movies is an excellent choice as the cia operative turned amnesiac jason bourne his presence is both believable and realistic like he is some guy who looks like a bookworm while the films cinematography was rather average there are moments in the film which presents actual anxiety the viewer knows something is coming yet the genuine far exhibited by the characters makes those moments so interesting i thought this would be some average action but i walked away amazed franka potente played the role of marie perfectly even though some prettier and less talented actress could have been placed in this film kudos to the producers for the casting choice 7410,intelligence

loved it especially the pursuit through europei think matt damon is a strong actor with an as usual compelling performance you know he is an assassin but you want him to succeed due to the way the story is set up i loved the solitary feel you have for damons character despite him nearly always being surrounded by random people i also liked the down to earth fighting style used throughout the movie made it feel real and more grounded having watched the tvm original i thought this would have to go some to enhance the story but it does it very welli recommend this as the solution to the incredulity of bond films,intelligence
matt damon plays jason bourne a highly trained us spy whose wounded body is found floating in an ocean by a fishing boat with no memory of who he is and what happened to him he has to piece together how he came to be shot in the back and left for dead and most importantly who and what he is but damon must do it fast as time is running out and the ones he worked for are sending assassins to find him is topnotch spy movie filled with action suspense and a mystery that is slowly explained as the movie goes on matt damon is well suited for the role and with the help of fancy editing he comes off as a martial arts expert who can quickly dispatch multiple foes in a few seconds the movie moves along very fast making the near two hour running time feel like its thirty minutes shorter than it is fast pacing and a likable hero damon are two big strengths of this movie that fans of spythrillersuspense movies should not miss my most memorable movie moment of is the scene when damon evades the police with an original mini car hey its not the car its the driver that countsmannysmemorablemoviemoment,intelligence
i enjoy the great special effects of movies such as the star wars series and other action packed movies such as the die hard and james bond films but the special effects are just as much a part of the plot and story lines as the writing it is refreshing to watch a film that does not rely on excessive special effects to tell its story 2002 is one such film stars matt damon as jason bourne a man found shot and lying in the ocean by fisherman who has lost his memory he struggles to regain his strength on the ship and he tries to piece his life back together he hits a dead end and finds that he must leave the boat bourne has a bank account number that leads him to a safety deposit box filled with money and fake passports bourne realizes that he must be a secret agent for some country he hooks up with marie played by franka potente as it turns out jason bourne was a secret agent who was shot because he did not fulfill his mission to assassinate wombasi an african leader played by adewale akinnouyeabaje there were agents who planned to kill bourne because he has now been considered a rogue agent one familiar face julia stiles plays nicolette an agent in an operator type position there was also the agent played by clive owen the professor who was one of the agents sent to hunt borne down and kill him packed with action and suspense this film is wonderfully shot there were flash cuts in certain action packed parts of the film also during the action there was minimal music playing in the background to add to the realistic feel to the film i can say that i enjoyed watching a film that did not need to blast techno or other type of music to express the action of the film the use of less sound made the film enjoyable you can concentrate on the action on the screen and not worry about who made the song and other things that can be distracting when watching a film these flash cuts and the use of less music added a dramatic feel to the film because borne can be a real person this can happen to any agent who defies the government and choose not to follow orders they can be hunted down,intelligence
always seen the books but never read them  now i will this is a great cloak and dagger spy story that really works in this format matt damon is not the perfect jason bourne as he just seems a bit young to forfill the role of bond like superspy however is acting skills are classy enough that he carries it off well the story is very fluid and the action is wellpaced easy to follow and yet never boring it really shows how a great story is the best place to start with a movie done in a very tasteful manner that makes it believable and engaging i consider myself a fussy movie viewer but this really was entertaining even the second and third times,intelligence
is the beginning of a series of movies that should set the bar for all thriller to comeit has a more than decent plot about an agents experience in the cia its action scenes are also excellent and are not too unrealistic the romance is also proficient and is kept to a minimumi personally dont see that often in thrillers so it keeps me more engaged in the filmthe cast and soundtrack are beyond excellence at first glancepost good will hunting matt damon doesnt seen like a person that is suitable to play jason bourne but proved us wrong now i cant watch a bourne movie without him the soundtrack was made by john powell which did a good job its no hans zimmer but it is better than most other thrillersoverall this movie was extremely good i highly recommend it,intelligence
having been a fan of the book i was very impressed with matt damon as jason bourne in fact the whole film was with great pace brilliant camera work and directingi love films that are more than about the casting and the way they get made this had a gripping approach throughout that aims to please the audience not many films have this these days so its refreshingi know a good film is really good when i have to go back and watch it again and again i saw this 4 times in 1 week the only other film to do this with me was peter jacksons the two towersits an outstanding film that will hold you to your seats until the end credits role,intelligence
this is a drama it is not midnight in paris the scenes could be the background for any american visitorthe right bank hotel looks like the ritz you just pass through you dont stay there  the strange phones  crossing pont neuf the gare du nord and its statues resembling a cathedral  the backgrounds along the seine  la samaritaine department store  lhotel des invalides and le tour eiffel in the background  driving on the quais on sidewalks and down a set of steps this movie is better than the sequels in the bourne series due to the romantic interest between jason and marie and the humanity expressed in the script vs the action in the sequels the script has some special lines such as jasons just keep on talking its relaxing and how do i know that and maries i said i was your personal assistant i just asked for it and nobody does the right thing and the dying agents line we always work alone the story raises issues about organizations which tend to eliminate their own members in the end truth and justice win out on an individual level if not a societal level which it seems was the authors message,intelligence
is a spy thriller which on the surface is strikingly similar in premise to the james bond series however as the movie commences and gathers momentum it becomes strikingly clear that the filmmakers have strived to make this movie a lot more focused on the characters and the plot even though there is enough action to satisfy the genre fans the intelligent way in which the story is presented gives us a unique perspective on the life of the lead characterjason bourne played by matt damon is a cia agent who was sent to perform a certain task in europe at the beginning of the movie bourne is unable to recall his identity or the purpose of his mission as the viewers are also unaware of this it allows us to see the world from his point of view i believe that this generates a much greater impact than knowing beforehand the identity of jason bournefor the majority of the movie jason bourne struggles to remember anything about his past which is well executed by matt damons acting the cia plan to capture him and the whole movie is essentially a battle between jason bourne and the ciatechnically all aspects of the movie is quite impressive a car chase sequence in particular is pulled off with consummate skill due to a runtime of just over two hours the movie keeps you hooked and the strong writing enables the film to never lose tractioni would highly recommend watching this movie as it is not a mere caricature of some other wellknown spy thrillers instead it is a unique story told by a talented director which has all the elements that are necessary for a timeless classic,intelligence
realistic thrilling fastpaced deadly but on top of all he needed luck to be on his side in order to solve his own puzzle whoever wrote the script deserves praise just as much as matt damonthis filmseries should have its own genre call it realistic thriller if youd like because it just doesnt do it justice by putting it in the same category as films like james bond theres no unneeded characters in the whole series no unneeded love scenes  which is the most unnecessary thing in a thrillerspy moviethe thing i love the most about this filmseries is that the background music is absolutely flawless to maintain the same level of excitementif not more with that same tune in the theme music for 3 movies is simply brilliant it brings the movie to the next levelpeople who are lazy to think lazy to listen to every word or simply just trying to watch some stuns or cool computer effects will be disappointed because this movie is nothing like that so dont watch it and call it bad just because you are not good enough for a movie that is a class above all the rest youve ever seen,intelligence
as a fan of james bond but acknowledging its campiness clichs and formulas it was extremely refreshing to see a true spyaction movie with a movie star i already respected but never thought could pull it off matt damon damon did a superb job as jason bourne in as did the rest of the cast you rooted for him sympathized with him and despite the past you soon learn to question you still wanted him to succeed bourne is found without a memory in the ocean by fishermen who attempt to help the young man by dropping him off with a little bit of cash near a place switzerland where he might regain his identity there he learns of extraordinary fighting skills he was unaware of and meets the soontobe and obvious love of his life marie both try and piece his past together while formulating a future together albeit on the run from a mysterious treadstone organization the action when shown is intense the intrigue storyline is not only plausible but ontheedge of your seat exciting and the cinematography is stunning  i must visit paris france soon the only flaws i can find though i didnt look for them was the obvious pairing of marie and bourne their inevitable sex scene and maries accent and languages that jumped from one culture to the next other than those minor defects this was a wonderful suspenseful and crafty movie i absolutely loved them reverting as they did with the asgood sequels from cgi and made me believe in action again and not the green screen also despite knowing there was more than one book this was based upon and knowing sequels were in the works i loved this was a completely stand alone feature and is absolutely recommended,intelligence

2002 directed by doug liman written by troy gilroy and w blake herron and starring matt damon as jason bourne franka potene as marie and chris cooper as conklin was originally a novel written by robert ludlum that was published in 1980 there was also a made for television revision of the novel that starred jacklyn smith and richard chamberlain in 1988 however the most successful of the three would be the movie starring matt damon this movie was about a young man who was recruited to work for the american government as an assassin during one of his missions he was shot and thought to be dead in the middle of the ocean and found by a foreign ship of some sort and nursed back to health once he was aware he realized he did not know who he was and thus he was unaware of his identity except that he was jason bourne jason soon sets out on a mission to discover who he is and why he is able to do incredible things like running extreme fast for a long distance without losing his breath or being able to speak several languages without remembering how he learned them and even his expertise in fighting and shooting jason begins to have flashbacks of people place and things that hes been or been involved with and starts to piece them together he remembers a bank account and locker number where he finds passports and money and is able to travel to some of the places in his memory and with the help of marie they realize who and what he wasthe lighting and the cinematography captured in the movie was impeccable doug liman the director did a wonderful job with the flashbacks and the locations that the film was set in the flashbacks that jason was having were made to feel like you were actually having the flashback yourself the color tone was a black and white with a small amount of color to make it true to real life flashbacks a memory the actual locations were set up so that you could imagine the action taking place would take place in the location i believe this movie would be an all time favorite like those of james bond was film with the perfect characters lighting and location to make it a box office hit if anyone else were to play jason bourne i dont think this movie would have turned out so great i recommend if you are a lover of action packed movies that you see this movie and you will agree with me and other movie goers believe that this is a must see film,intelligence

sick of all those recent spy flicks i dont need to name them you know what im talking about where plot and characters are buried by hundreds of visual effects and everything is the same movie after movie after movie then try which brings new life to the genre its got everything youre after intelligent story believable and likable characters and yes action too but its realistic action not some matrixstyle kickingthe most intriguing aspect is arguably that the hero is a vulnerable human being in fact at the beginning of the movie he is found halfdead in the french sea once he recovers this stranger matt damon is stunned to realize he can speak five or six languages fluently but doesnt remember where he learned them or anything that happened prior to his awakening for that matter the only clue he has is a bank account number in switzerland which reveals his name is jason bourne and he s involved in some kind of classified activity unfortunately he doesnt have much time to sort things out as his superiors chris cooper and brian cox think he has deserted and decide to take him down with only a german student named marie franka potente willing to help him bourne must put all the pieces together and find out exactly who he is before it is too late director doug liman and screenwriter tony gilroy have made their own version of robert ludlums novel is almost completely different but who cares as long as the movie works its one of the best spy stories ever made and it looks like something that could actually happen all of bournes weapons can be purchased by an average citizen this is the antibond a man who actually gets hurt and would rather be left alone and his vulnerability is grippingly conveyed through damons powerful performance if there is a defect it has to be the fact that the films focus is almost entirely on the protagonist overshadowing a fine supporting cast especially cooper and clive owen whose turn as the professor manages to be much more than a stereotyped silent killer pantomimeprobably the most interesting action movie of 2002 with an even better sequel continuing in the same direction,intelligence
this is a solid suspensespy film with an agentontherun scenario people who like a paranoid theme where everyone is after you i plead guilty will love this the good  the amount of violence in here was just about right not too much and not too little i also enjoyed the paris scenery both the streetlevel shots and the aerial photography ovrall the cinematography is very good in this film its an involving story that once youre hooked you stay that way the two hours go by pretty quickly the cast is interesting i was familiar with franke potente after seeing her in run lola run potente has a different and intriguing look to her the action scenes in here are very good including an excellent car chasethe bad  i get tired of american filmmakers trashing their own government all the time in here its them trying to kill one of their own agents also there are too many usages of the lords name in vain mainly said by chris coopers character it also took a bit to accept matt damon as some physicallyrough spy since his image was not that prior to this filmoverall  a good movie that is part of my collection i liked the sequel even better although part of the reason was that i was now familiar with the main characters after watching this film anyway i highly recommend both movies for fans of suspense crime intrigue good locales etc,intelligence
when i first heard what this film was about from a friend of mine who had just seen it i liked the sound of it  when he told me that matt damon was playing the lead part as a covertclandestine cia operative with amnesia  martial arts skills etc i must admit  i just couldnt picture it  i guess because i hadnt seen him in that type of role before   but when i watched this film  all my doubts were banished i already thought of matt damon as a good actor before this film  but his performance in this  and all of the bourne films  elevates him  to one of the truly great actors its the fact that he is so convincing in the role and that you can really sympathise with the character as it turns out  casting matt damon for this role is pure genius i simply cant imagine anyone else in the role one of the many aspects of his performance which impressed me was the attention to detail for example the effort he put into the pronunciation of the different languages he speaks in the film which without a doubt contributed to the character being more believableim glad the film didnt go down the route of getting the actors to speak all in english regardless of which country they were in  as so any other us films do  the excellent franka potente was equally impressive  and was the perfect match up with damon her character adds a different dimension to the story and works well giving the bourne character more depth and allows viewers to see bourne in a different light the action sequences in this film are superb finally an actionthriller with fight sequences that are as realistic as they are complex this is what all actionthrillers should be like this sets the benchmark 1010 ,intelligence
not that there is any bias intended against the spy film genre far from it nor with films that contain a good deal or a lot of action there are some good very good even ones out there there are also however ones that are too derivative are basically style over substance a few not even executing the style particularly well and favour canseeitcoming thrills and twists and bombastic action over telling a good storywhat a pleasant surprise that turned out to be had heard next to nothing but good things about the bourne films and had been meaning to check them out for a while while worrying as to whether theyd be my cup of tea or not not only does what it set out to do very well with lots of fun and intrigue but it is also a film that has a brain and respects its audience it clearly knew what it wanted to be and who to aim it atsure the basic story is not exactly original occasionally there is a little routineness this doesnt really matter all that much though because succeeded in giving the genre a considerable freshness on the whole it does lose its way a little towards the end when things do become a little too clich and some things could have been explained better and felt less confused while still doing a good job clive owen did deserve more to do than what he got a come and go character that disappears too quickly and earlyhowever visually is very slick and stylish special effects very wisely kept at minimum am not always a fan of the camera technique used here but here it added to the intensity and didnt feel that excessive or abused certainly didnt look amateurish either a reasonably dynamic soundtrack and authentic sound quality helps too as does astute direction that keeps everything moving along with confidencecontains a sharp and well written script that provokes thought with nothing being confused rambling or cheesy the story for much of the length is exciting and has a considerable freshness that is really refreshing the pacing is relentless while avoiding the traps of being too hectic or being dull neither of which it ever is the action is very well choreographed confidently performed and keeps one on the edge of their seatmatt damon carries the title role with ease and franka potente provides gutsy support their chemistry to me was believable chris cooper is fun and while a little too briefly utilised clive owen and brian cox both do very good jobsin summary surprisingly good and entertaining and a very good start to the bourne films 810 bethany cox,intelligence
the only reason why im giving this movie a 9 is because the next bourne movies are even better this is the best secret agent movie i ever seen much better than that stupid movie jack ryan shadow recruit the action in this movie is unbelievable if you dont watch this movie you are missing out on a lot definitely a bang for the buck and spoilers alert you do see a lot of julia stiles ass for a good portion of the movie so that is also a plus and matt daemon if you swing the other way other than that you got to see it and i want to end my review right here but imdb is making me write more so i will write enough to make it to the next line there we go,intelligence

i remember seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters in 2002 back then it was so fresh and so goodit was a unique story that kept you on the edge of your seat indeed in 2002 i probably would have given this movie 1010 starsthat said watching this movie on blu ray recently i felt like its still a great filmbut one that loses a bit of its charm on a successive viewing this movie is full of suspense and cliffhanger scenes that make you wonder whats coming next but its also a story that once youve seen it once you more or less know whats going to happen and so the thrill factor deteriorates significantly thus making the movie not as fun to watch time and againanother thing that the movie has going against it is the picture quality that the movie is filmed in the movie has a clarity that at many times makes it look more like the set of a sitcom than a spy movie this is especially true for indoor scenesit may very well have been exceptionally good lighting rather than the type of film itself that was used whatever the case the movie at times looks too polished and too crispstill overall this is a fantastic movie matt damon plays an amnesiac who slowly but surely uncovers bits and pieces about who he actually is that knowledge is more obvious more quickly to the audience than it is to damons characterbut throughout the film we learn more and more about the fascinating back story of this man without a memory and the story is engaging and full of thrills all that said im giving this movie 810 stars its a great movie but one that there are a few flaws to nitpick,intelligence

in 1962 hollywood introduced british spy james bond who made an iconic name in the action genre and the legacy of this household action hero continues today through the longest running film franchise in the 1980s we were introduced to bruce willis john mcclane a new york cop who served justice as he took a dozen of german terrorists at the nakatomi plaza one by one and his astonishing charisma has lead to a spawn of a few sequels matt damon as jason bourne is what some describe as just a modern day james bond but with a powerful portrayal by damon he feels more like an original character a spy agent with a highly trained set of fighting skills in both gun and handto hand combat in this spy action thrilled directed by doug liman matt damon steps into what is arguably his most charismatic role aside from his oscarnominated performance in good will hunting damon plays the title character jason bourne a cia agent who wakes up on a boy after being rescued by a group of fisherman suffering from amnesia and covered in bullet wounds he travels to switzerland where he uses his old bank account to put together the puzzle pieces of his identity he is soon assisted by german woman marie played by franka potente to search for his identity but soon find himself by hunted down by ruthless assassins by black ops agent alexander conklin played by chris cooper bourne must escape from the vicious criminals while searching for answers to what they want him for not very many action flicks offer a spectacular mix of tense action and mystery like this action thriller from the hyperkinetic action sequences to its slick editing to the highly compelling plot to the overall likability of the lead character this film stops at almost nothing to deliver the strong visceral experience viewers come to root for in an age where many films of the action genre struggle to find a solid balance of both action and coherent plot development this one manages to stand out the plot moves through the title characters search of his identity and the conspiracy that surrounds and what ensues is a nice array of tension and unpredictable scenes the fiercest moments show jason bourne engaging in brutal martial arts combat against the baddies complete with stunning choreography and camerawork that while a bit shaky successfully express the intensity of the scenes one of the most intense moments lies in a beautifully shot staircase shootouts scene the film definitely has a sweet taste in action and it delivers quite well especially with matt damon whos quite energizing vibrant in the lead role franka potente is also very strong as her character who makes a competent supporting character rather than a typical damselindistress praise can also be given to chris cooper as the main villain he may not serve as a memorable antagonist but thats not the point as the lead characters primary goal is not to capture or kill the villain but to search for the reason why he the antagonist trying to take him downis tense thrilling and purely entertaining experience for action fans everywhere this film is easily a household name in matt damons career as well as the action genre of the 2000s for all looking for a great popcorn flick this one is worth checking out,intelligence
its hard to believe the bourne franchise is over 14 years old with 4 successful films under its belt to this point and one more on the way jason bourne has become one of hollywoods most enduring protagonists luckily after so long and many repeated viewings still holds upbefore paul greengrass came on board and gave us a few heart stopping thrill rides doug liman directed the first entry in the series while there are a few dated stylistic choices by liman he did a great job kicking off the series it was released in 2002 but it definitely has a 90s actionthriller vibe from its look and feel its also far less cinematic than its successors and in turn makes for a great cable watch which is probably why ive seen this film north of 10 timesas i understand the films budget spiraled after several reshoots and push backs so john powell had little to work with in terms of a natural score i feel like that helped him create a more grounded sound and tone to the series as he has gone on to score 3 more bourne films powells score along with the great end credits moby tag make for one good listen doesnt nearly have the scope that the greengrass films do but it has a surprisingly amount of awareness for an action film the entire series is more cerebral than it gets credit foraccompanying matt damon as bourne himself is an impressive cast that consists of german star franka potente chris cooper brian cox and clive owen potente serves a great counter to damon in that they both play lost souls searching for answers she also essentially plays the audience who is going along with bourne as he ventures deep into his past owen cooper and cox are all great as different levels of cia agents particularly clive owen who does so much with so little amount of dialogueim of the belief that besides legacy the bourne films get better as the series goes on with a charismatic performance from damon in a somewhat unlikable role its all the more impressive just how successful these films have become hopefully that continues moving forwarddamons commitmentsupporting castpowells grounded scoregood action but better characterssome dated stylistic choices9010,intelligence
when i saw to the theater in 2002 i was skeptical about because i havent seen the trailers nor heard of it on tv but figure it was better than staying at home so why not go see it turns out to be a wise choice because this film is worth the time to check it outit features a creative story that is better to watch to appreciate because you will need to pay close attention to otherwise youll be lost in the woodsdoes a real original take of the spy movie genre which i like the way the film starts get you wondering the crew and cast must have did a lot of research in psychology because they really dig into the psychological of the human mind for a spy film the cast of matt damon franka potente chris cooper clive owen adewale akinnuoyeagbaje brian cox made the film really interesting along with other cast members like julia stiles their performances in the film help makes the characters important without a good cast you cant make a film serious and believe me this film is more than serious enough to hold your interestingplus the action and stunts in the film really get you on the edge of your seat it did for everyone in the theater and still does on dvd which i owned its just amazing how well they dig into the psychology of the human mind this film takes a departure from the bond films nothing wrong with them but bourne does a lot more than just be an action movie which it is still but it more to itis unlike many spy movies as this one make for a good mix of psychology and action which makes it quite the filmwith a good cast tense action and a character driven story this is a movie you should check out i give an 9 out of 10,intelligence

jason bourne has no idea who he is or what happened anytime before 2 weeks ago all he knows is he was rescued from the middle of the ocean by fishermen with two bullets in his back when he gets to europe he realizes that almost everyone wants him dead he learns that he can speak many languages and is skilled in fighting and killing but he has no idea how he teams with a young gypsy to travel across france trying to learn who he is and why this is all happening this movie balances action and mystery very well we only learn what jason bourne does and actually piece the story together as he does a pretty good action movie with a spy anyone can relate tosoundtrack 8 not a perfect soundtrack but it did capture the art of the film and helped establish bournes feelingsscript 9 excellent pacing and for the most part great character development the average joe angle with a spy angle underneath played out welloriginality 10 spies have been seen before but never like this great jobcinematography 9 the director captured a gritty action style while also giving the feel of standing alongside bourne as he goes through his challenges himselfcasting 8 most of the actors fit the roles they were given few did not matt damon was the correct casting choiceacting 8 the actors did a good job excluding a select fewoverall 86,intelligence

is a tense thrillride anchored by matt damons strong central performance as a amnesiac assassin in search of who he is it also kickstarted the bourne series which raised the bar for intelligent action films theres not too much need to go into plot details except that jason bourne is a former ciatrained assassin who is nearly killed when a job goes south he wakes up with no memory of what happened before and sets off on a mission to find out who he is and why he is being hunted one aspect i really liked was the balance between action and drama the action scenes are quite relentless but the film also allows a relationship to be developed between matt damons bourne and marie franka potente a woman he meets practically by chance they each have their own somewhat similar problems and they work together to try and fix them normally these types of movies just focus on the protagonist but here the audience is also exposed and given insight into the other side the people who are trying to bring bourne back in although some suspension of disbelief is required the movie does feel grounded in reality especially considering the recent glut of leaks regarding the nsa in my opinion it was nice to see the inner workings of intelligence agencies and to top it off a smattering of government intrigue as well i thought the plotting was very solid and the performances across the board were very good the only weak link i found was julia stiles as nicolette a parisbased cia asset who runs a safe house i thought her role was slightly underwritten and her performance wasnt as good as the rest of the cast moving on the technical aspects of the film were all excellent i thought that the action sequences were wellfilmed and easy to follow in a geographical sense the fights were quite intense and wellchoreographed as well matt damon makes for a good action star and this movie is proof of that the score was also quite good and helped maintain tension throughout the nearly twohour running time all in all i thought that this was an excellent action film that can hold its own against similar series like james bond which this clearly was intended as highly recommended for fans of action films and thrillers you wont be disappointed,intelligence
this is the best secret services agent type movie i have ever seen i mean come on after james bond or ethan hunt in mi what better performance you can expect than this d matts acting is so freakishly real and his expression are just what the viewers need when they are staring at the screen and wondering whats gonna happen next and the story is expandable and concise at the same time i dont know what else to say about this movie except its awesomebourne identity is very much real than the other spy work movies and the mysteries they left about the character bourne  oh man next parts are plotted perfectly to continue the thrill and concealing the whole story about the bournes pastthe dialogues been used between pamelajoan allen and bourne are amazing and well written i really loved the way the seems to communicate overall thats it i mean if you have passion for this kinda movies take my advise and sit down to watch the bourne series you will be amazed how it works out in the whole scenario  you are gonna love this movie and all the characters in itgood luck,intelligence

there are a lot of movies where the cia is its principal theme but this one is the best ive ever seen about it so far i didnt know about this trilogy until 2010 i said whatever people is talking very well about this one lets give it a shot what can i say it was not a waste of time the first time i saw it couldnt wait for the part 2 i just became a big fan of matt damon the movie has everything drama action good acting and a great history damon is the only one who can be a jason bourne in my opinion his character is so smart but not so brilliant like a jet li you will see a realistic movie in all its senses even the fights have realism but remember this is not all about fighting shooting enemies or killing people like a crazy man this is a different movie you will enjoy for sure if you are looking for a man who kills everyone just because he wants to i recommend you to not watch this movie strongly recommended to everyone nothing more to say,intelligence
is the first film in the hit spy trilogy starring matt damon as an apparent ex cia assassin it comes off as a slick and smart film avoiding the usual action clichs and having very intelligent ideas that work the film is high octane stuff mainly thanks to the interesting premise excellent performances and superb action set piecesthe plot sees fishermen recover a mans body out at sea with two bullet holes in his back he is suffering from amnesia and doesnt remember who he was later discovering his name to be jason bourne a laser device planted in his hip shows him his bank account which is full of money and a gun bourne then finds himself hunted by the police and with the help of a woman named marie he searches for answers in paris which lead all the way to the cia the story flows extremely well and has a lot of twists that help in making things more interesting the general story about bourne is just an interesting one and you can never really tell where the film is going to end up which makes it all the more grippingthe cast is exceptional matt damon is excellent as bourne perfectly portraying him as confused and conflicted but still very clever he does a great job of handling the action intense and emotional scenes with astuteness franka potente is equally good as marie she comes off as likable and her normality gives her a realistic edge she makes for a sensitive and courageous companion for bourne chris cooper does an incredibly solid job as the cia man who is tracking bournes every move he shows him as a cold calculating figure without removing all of his humanity brian cox is great as always as the intense abbott coxs sheer presence shows intellect and cunning julia stiles is very good as informer nicky clive owen is very good too as the stoic assassin the professorthe action scenes are brilliant the fights scenes are a lot more realistic than most films which makes them fast exciting and surprisingly brutal the fight with the wouldbe assassin and the climax in particular are excellently shot the car chase is a highlight it just feels naturally gritty while still being a thrilling and entertaining set piece the characters are well fleshed out which is something most action films miss out on bourne is an interesting person and as he finds out more so do the audience he eventually does feel like a real spy and thanks to damons intense portrayal he does appear to be fighting for his life the same goes for the realism as the characters do come across as somewhat vulnerable the film itself is shot really well it captures paris very beautifully and espionage atmosphere is nicely heavy its surprising how well paced it is it seemingly moves quickly but still has time to add hints of melancholy and emotion to the story itself it is a brilliant style of relying on story and characters with bursts of action and energy which harken back to older action films the score by john powell is great as it is both nicely moody and rather exhilarating when it needs to be is tense thrilling and emotive in equal doses as its one of the finest spy films around,intelligence
to describe in just one word it is  fascinating there is not a moment in the movie when you will idle out i had no idea that matt damon was such a talented and famous actor after watching this movie i quickly ran to nearby stores and rented the next 2 installments of the bannerit is much more pleasing to watch than any other action or spy film i have watched involves the least bit of violence or blood shed much better than mi movies or bond moviesvery mysterious simple to understand and catches your attention fantastic background music well scripted well directed and well made,intelligence
a bold and intense suspense trip that doesnt let up until the final scene it successfully blends noir spy thriller suspense and action styles while maintaining incredible pacing and heart beating intensity the minimalist score does a great job capturing the essence of what is occurring in the film and the level of intrigue that this world creates leaves us begging for more while damon is excellent other sub characters are weak and poorly introduced and written there are one or two bothersome plot holes that always drive me crazy when watching but other than those minor issues is a aaa thriller with suspense and thrillers to spare,intelligence
made a splash when it came out and quickly became a reference the action tries to stay realistic while giving a powerful adrenaline ride to the audience what makes this spy flick interesting is that the main character is hyperprecise an unstoppable machine the settings are unglamorous and the protagonists and their motivation simple to understandthat being said the story itself is not simple its very captivating and the main idea extremely interesting the characters have a certain depth to them and even though their psychological profile is not complex it is well done the camera work is incredible the theme song is good the action and editing are tight and the details all work out logicallymatt damon definitely plays one of his best role and gets you right into bournes skin franka potente is just right as his lead female you want to slap chris coopers character almost from the very start julia stiles has a small role but at the time it was a mature one for her and brian cox wraps it up quite nicely while the rest of the crew doesnt disappoint a single timenow the few little points i found that did work for me the night sea shots look like a set terrible fortunately you only see a few the dictator is a bit over the top and finally the car would never have made it down those steps in driving condition but thats a common movie mistake the cars in chases continue to run whatever happens to them bottom line those are all minor problems that you see only after watching the film many timesthis is one of the great action flicks dont miss it,intelligence
i really enjoyed the first outing of bourne i think it was a coming of age film for matt damon and although it isnt his best performance he did prove the doubters wrong personally my favourite of the trilogy as the web unfolds and the plot thickens the pace of this action packed thriller just goes from strength to strength i enjoyed watching the original tv series and thought the movie did a good oh of transferring it to the big screen i enjoyed how the character unfolds and his balance of emotion and anger are ignited through his confusion enough is covered in this opening movie to give you the taste for wanting more but not leaving you bemused the supporting cast do a decent enough job of carrying damon through the scenes and even a heavyweight pitches in clive owento lend a supporting hand damon almost reminds me of an insomniac 007but maybe with less suave about him all in all a good effort and full marks for keeping me entertained damon proving himself and making sure that the likes of good will hunting were not just a fluke the other two movies fit in perfectly and make the whole 3 parts one it satisfying meal of a movie,intelligence
i got my moneys worth after choosing this on the back of a jonathan ross comment on the cover i left my now closed thankfully what a dump video shop with something i hoped would remove me from reality and give the fiver i had just parted with the respect it deservedtraining day was the same price and was recommended to me by a friend who has similar taste but i couldnt bring myself to argue with a film nut who for me had been on the money a lot of the timeboth films had been out long enough to be discounted vhs promos both are great and worth the 9 stars ive givenone ive seen twice one ive seen 15 times and countingits not a perfect film but its brilliant as is the 1988 mini series on which this is in my view based upon jason bournes journeyadventure was cool very cool and my fiver wherever it is got maxed out long ago and i take my hat off to it,intelligence
this is a great film which i would recommend to anyone who loves action films and the spy type of film this is not like the normal type of spy film it is very different to most of the others this makes it a must see one thing that let it down was the car action which you could tell was fake but apart from that the film was spotless you didnt actually see him doing his job and his task instead you got him running away from the people he work for that are trying to kill him the actors in the film are great they play the roles really good and that the thing seem real like you are in the actual film and part of the people in the film it is gripping near the end and you just want to know what happens and if he is going to die,intelligence
previously filmed as a tv miniseries in the 1980s robert ludlums spy thriller gets reimagined for the movie audiences of the 21st century and its a refreshingly more human look at a well worn genre giving us a hero whos believable at all times he may become a standard action hero in some scenes yet has the appeal of an average joe matt damon delivers a creditable performance in this role at the start of this story hes fished out of the mediterranean sea with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is soon hes forced to take it on the lam as his cia superiors back home are determined to put closure on his botched mission fortunately he manages to hook up with a young woman marie franka potente of run lola run who is able to provide him with some all important transportation the action scenes are stylishly staged but never overwhelm the meaty story which gets a respectful adaptation thanks to screenwriters tony gilroy  w blake herron director doug liman and a talented cast and crew they just hook you right in with an impressive atmospheric opening and slowly but surely begin to crank up the tension fine use is made of various international locations and the widescreen cinematography by oliver wood is excellent damon is fun to watch in the lead even though his character may be in the dark for the balance of the movie he always shows himself able to adapt to different situations and to sense when danger is near he shares a good chemistry with german star potente whos very appealing and as sexy as any bond girl in the james bond franchise also in the excellent cast are chris cooper brian cox adewale akinnuoyeagbaje walton goggins and julia stiles although clive owen is kind of wasted as a professional assassin dubbed the professor his is an intriguing character who disappears from the story a little too soon many riveting scenes including one where bourne is kind of making like spiderman during an escape attempt and a lively car chase sequence even at 119 minutes this never feels as long as it is as damon liman and company keep you watching and engrossed the entire time all in all this can stand up very well against any james bond series entry or other spy film of old its got enough vitality and solid story telling to make it pleasant viewing executive produced by ludlum and followed by the bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatum eight out of 10,intelligence
this movie is simply greatspoilers were immediately thrown into the story and the water as bourne wakes up on a fishing trawler with no memory of who he is or what he does or just about anything really his only lead being a code that takes him to a bank in zurich quickly though he learns that hes an outstanding fighter able to respond quickly to any threat on pure instinct he also quickly learns that someone wants him dead for reasons he of course knows nothing about so as he learns more and more so do we and were thrown into the life of an amnesiac that finds out that hes a killer one of many trained to kill without hesitation or emotion all of them a part of the treadstone operationand the life is hardly a flashy one its straight to the point you do the job and get out and more importantly you dont fail or youre likely to end up dead matt damon is great as the amnesiac jason bourne playing the character with 30 confusion 30 frustration and 40 determination to survive franka potente is just as great as marie kreutz a woman swept along with the ride on a 10000 whim thrown into the chaos giving bourne a supporting shoulder when he needs it the most and shes got a smile to die for but thats neither here or there she becomes the anchor and though she at one point really doubts what shes gotten herself into or who bourne really is in the end her reluctance to leave and disappointment when bourne finally gets her into the car is visible and well played by the actressthe movie pretty much sets its pace early and it keeps to it giving bourne little to no time to find out whats going on without someone hunting for him or anyone that might come between them he has no clever gadgets no agency that protects his actions he has only himself his skills and every now and then marie to help him survive the hunt for information if you like action movies with a realistic touch to them the bourne series will hopefully not leave you disappointedat least it didnt to me 910,intelligence
i am a fan matt damon and of spy thrillers and mystery genre in general however i am always wary of hollywood clich movies that leave you unsatisfied if not aggravated this film is a refreshing and enjoyable exception the cast is picked masterfully and plays great together strong performances from matt damon and franka potente leave you breathless what i was on a look out for is a shallow dialogue thinking the movie will focus primarily on action scenes and chase sequences i was pleasantly surprised by the delicate balance of both you do have moments where you wonder if the script could have been improved a little bit because of the improbability of events i am talking about the obvious stupidity of certain agents that chase jason and gaps and holes in cia surveillance in general you have numerous questions and concerns as to could that really have happened but once you get over that little obstacle be prepared to be entertained go watch the dvd you wont regret it,intelligence
matt damon had a huge splash on the hollywood scene in 1997 with good will hunting but his followup movies like the talented mr ripley all the pretty horses and the legend of bagger vance failed to captivate both audiences and critics alike it was this movie that not only made damon an action movie start but a bankable star in general who started to get offered much better projects afterwardsthe story is about a highly trained cia assassin who while on a mission gets amnesia and then subsequently betrayed by his handlersafter damon the stunts and the action scenes are the reasons this movie worked so well along with a great supporting cast with chris cooper julia stiles franka potente and brian cox,intelligence

is a 2002 film directed by doug limon and starring matt damon the film follows the story of jason bourne damon an amnesiac desperately attempting to discover more about his true identity while simultaneously embedding himself in a convoluted conspiracy involving the cia now when i had first heard s fairly original and intriguing premise i was already expecting this movie to be great did it disappoint no no it did not this is one of those movies that just cannot fail  it has a rock solid story crafted by one of the most intelligent authors of our time a brilliant screenplay written by one of hollywoods most sought after screenwriters and an intensely entertaining lead performance and its sequels are often credited with setting the par for most spy thrillers of the past decade  does it deserve that credit i believe so for i have seen a multitude of films with similar concepts that have come out since s release however most if not all of the movies that have tried to replicate what the bourne movies have done cannot reach the level of intrigue that each of the bourne movies have reached  and they promptly fall flat in comparison that being said everything about this film beit its fighting sequences its car chase or its intense cinematography has made an impact on the spy thriller genre and the modern film industry as a whole all in all i felt that was an intensely entertaining thriller with a large amount of intelligence clearly woven it,intelligence
while this movie purports to be an adaptation of robert ludlums classic action novel it actually borrows some of the main plot points and nothing more which actually is a quite good decision this new 2000supdated version of a story in which a man found floating unconsciously in the mediterranean sea and suffering from a total amnesia slowly starts picking up pieces of his forgotten past as a undercover agent actually works is a decent action flick with lots of highspeed chases and handtohand combat scenes matt damon is very believable and natural as the title character and franka potente as his love interest shows why she could be regarded as the modern cinemas overlooked gem chris cooper also shines as the bad guy although he is unlucky to share many scenes with the late brian cox and cox always had the ability to steal the scene whenever he appears on screen and this movie is no exception a good action flick 810,intelligence
what makes an action movie good is it the special effects the explosions the exotic women the fancy gadgets the bourne series puts these questions to the test there are almost no special effects in this movie there are no explosions in this movie there are no particularly sexy women in this movie there are no gadgets in the movie on the contrary the computers used by the cia look like computers that were around in 2004 but i would like to put it out there that is one of the best spythrillers ever releasedthe bourne series is really a blatant winning movie its gripping its confusing just to the perfect level where the audience has to keep watching to understand the plot at the end of the movie we want to know who this man weve come to know as jason bourne isi think we as an audience should challenge ourselves to challenge hollywood to make more movies like this movies that dont rely on that woah factor movies that can make it and be great movies without sex gore and violencefor you action junkies out there dont let this review fool you there is still action in this movie the multiple fight scenes while not filling the movie are interesting and facedpaced i firmly recommend this as a mustsee movie and a mustsee series for anyone who enjoys action movies,intelligence
those of you who have ever read any of the great novels written by robert ludlum know he is a superb writer having read the book which is the basis for  i found that director doug liman did not adhere very closely to the book instead he allowed the main character to float to the top of his demise like a dangerous water mine and allowed the ticking to get louder as the movie progresses our hero is found floating in the waters off the coast of marseilles dead to the world yet within weeks jason bourne is out to learn what is that ringing in his head what was he doing before he was shot but most important of all who is he the film begins with a watery mystery followed by a trail of bread crumbs which then explodes with a high powered surge of pure adrenalin action scenes follows bourne wherever he goes and so too his adversaries who are just as lethal as he is excitement awaits movie audiences as our hero encounters both the heavies as well as his fellow treadstone agents false identities are as plentiful as the bullets which try to kill him but for any ludlum fan what awaits us at the end of the film is usually not what we expect for that we need to read the book exceptional acting by the fine cast and a great way to spend an evening with matt damon ,intelligence
again last paragraph for serious reviewfrom france to switzerland and the czech republic does a wonderful job of using the scenery in creating dynamic eye popping action this is definitely one end of the spectrum in action movies the other end of the spectrum would be around negative 65 and with that number would be the new release of the hit action movie unknownthis is mainly because unknown is in berlin and as eventful an action movie as watching an american womens basketball game however bourne is a masterpiece in which i enjoyed the entire movie where as in unknown i enjoyed booing the last scenes and applauding the end creditswell its about time to fix my roof because of those damn kiwi birds keep crapping and clogging my gutters so lets get to the endpoint of my movie summary the movie is great the action is great and damon is breathtaking this is a great series to watch and hopefully you wont make the same mistake that i did and spend your hard earned dollar on neeson or edward the vampire thingwith warm fuzzy pleasure al da juice grapeps i only use my bathtub for homebrewed booze,intelligence
this is one of these films that i always catch up with later post the hype but totally enjoyable the european locations totally work for me and the public in general ludlum knew that europe provides the most cultural and evocative of settings the slightly less credible amnesiac was apparently born of the writers vietnam experiences so perhaps is more of a reference to ptsdbut he does not linger on it above all else ludlum was an entertainer and this shows in the plot development sneaky cia type organisations departments of dirty tricks and enigmatic assassins which are plentiful along with excellent car chases and sophisticated weaponry this is part of a very well made spy trilogy and must be applauded especially when you consider these films as a good substitute for the presently awful daniel craig bond fayre and like bond you are tempted to rush out and buy jasons tag heuerand spruce up that old mini of yours an american in europe absolutely and totally enjoyable,intelligence
as you can tell i am a huge fan of the bourne series because of the fact that matt damon is my favorite actor and that i own the movies on dvd and blu ray now on with the review allot of people thought at first that this was going to be a rip off of james bond but they were sadly mistaken it turned out to be one of the greatest films of 2002 it was rated 8 out of the top 10 films of 2002 this was a great movie to say the least every opportunity was taken which made it very successful i say that this film made matt damons career not to say he didnt have great movies before that but this movie was his best in my eyes him playing the character jason bourne made his careerthe story was brilliant too because it had not been used so far in any other movie that i know of i am not going to spoil the movie but i will just give a little summary jason bourne matt damon is highly trained spy who loses his memory but just because his memory is lost doesnt mean the agency that hired him forgot about him so he is put through many obstacles because his agency tries to terminate him because of a failed mission this movie is filled with action and adventure it also had a great cast besides matt damon they had chris cooper brian cox and julia stilesmy favorite scene in the entire film would have to be the mini cooper chase i thought it was well edited and well directed by doug liman the action was perfect in this scene when i was younger i would constantly watch that scene i would fast forward all the way to that scene and just watch that scene it completely obvious how many stars i give this film and that would be 10 out of 10 stars,intelligence
this movie was everything its case said it would be an explosive actionpacked hit with incredible fight sequences a supercharged thrillaminute spectacular loaded with nonstop action these are words you seem to find on just about every moviecase these days but in this case you can believe them it had me fully enthralled from start to finish the tempo seemed to ebb and flow from fullout action to dramatic character interaction and development flawlessly the carchase and handtohand fighting scenes might be the best ever put to film and matt damon who has sounded like hes trying a little too hard in some of his other efforts is 100 believable everything about this movie draws you in and forces you to want moreim not sure why its only a 77 in the eyes of the imdb world but in my opinion its worth much more easily a 9 this is what action movies should aspire tobut thats just my two scents ,intelligence
is the first movie of a very successful trilogy the movie begins with a body floating in water off the coast of france pulled into a boat soon we learn he is not an ordinary person there is something mysterious about him he is suffering from memory loss and doesnt remember anything about his own identity on top of that there are dark characters lurking at every corner that are chasing after him as the story unfolds we get to find out more about him but there is still a good amount of unknown facts that maintain the suspense and mystery this is a very wellmade movie with a very well written screenplay amazing action scenes the car chase scene is just amazing that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end jason bourne like james bond is a spy and this is a spy movie but in many ways there are major differences which make quiet special most james bond movies are onedimensional in the sense that james bond is the good guy and everybody he is eliminating are the bad guys jason bourne on the other hand is multidimensional because he is constantly redefining himself and that goes throughout the entire trilogy and the movie is not really drawing a clear picture if he is the bad guy or the good guy this ambiguity is possible due to his amnesiac condition for all we know he may have been a bad guy before his accident but now he is defining himself with his current actions this ambiguity creates a mystery around him and the mystery is thickened through the identity of the people who are trying to eliminate him mainly conklin chris cooper who is running the treadstone project more about treadstone in later movies the conflict between jason bourne and conklin and bournes turning against the people who gave him the assignment adds a whole another dimension to the movie which is not seen in james bond movies i must say that is probably the best movie of its kind it doesnt fall into known clichs unrealistic action scenes explosions hero doesnt display any super powers no special effects no silly plot twists and turns or plot holes all of which we are accustomed to see in average hollywood production highly recommended,intelligence
the strength of is that the audience is in exactly the same position as matt damons jason bourne throughout the movie  in complete ignorance as to exactly who bourne is but quietly desperate to find out we however are given more information than he is because we are given occasional glimpses into the operations of the shadowy organisation for which bourne works in the persons of chris cooper brian cox and julia stylesthis film powers along delivering exposition paranoia action and excitement for its entire running length matt damn is an excellent lead he has a powerful physical presence in the action sequences but he also conveys the low key distress of someone who is disturbed at discovering what he is capable of franka potente is a believable companion sucked into circumstances beyond her comprehensionthe script is good making a simple story into something highly textured and the film as a whole is two hours of gripping fastpaced entertainment a cut above the usual standard for this type of movie,intelligence
robert ludlum has given the public a series of eventful books which have captivated the reader audience for over twenty years his books that reach the screen also captivates and this film is no exception matt damon plays a secret black ops agent named jason bourne a one man killing machine with abilities that even the most present military divisions can envy using tactical hand to hand combat with precise moves just flabbergast the audience yet his ability to discern possible outcomes to a scenario to achieve his goals also keep the people riveted to their seats he loses his memory in a job which backfires because of a glimpse of guilt from trying to assassinate a brutal dictator in doing so he is shot in the back and falls into the sea to be rescued by a local fishing boat but his path has gaps and he needs to find who is responsible for his memory loss and why he was shot but his path will soon be revealed in small clues which lead him back to the source of all his misery and when that happens the people had better run because when jason bourne comes running nothing can stop him excellent film dedicated to an excellent author robert ludlum,intelligence
reviewbot jason bourne matt damon is a man of mystery he is found floating adrift in the ocean at the start of the movie with no memories and no identity all he has to go on are two bullet wounds in his back and an implanted device which displays a swiss bank account number i have something not unlike this so needless to say i was already intrigued he soon discovers he has a knack for beating people up and escaping tricky situations as different cia agents are trying to kill him along his way he hitches a ride with a young german woman marie franka potente who gets caught up in the chase and helps bourne try to rediscover his unknown pastis a sleek film with an array of interesting locations throughout europe to keep you entertained the action sequences are fast paced with plenty of interesting fight scenes and car chases without reliance on hefty special effects it has often been compared with james bond however i find this irrelevant bourne is a grittier action hero and not dissimilar to a robot which i find pleasing matt damon portrays the character well a man obviously trained to kill but with a sense of vulnerability franka potente as the quirky marie has good chemistry with damon and also puts in a good performanceoverall this is an action packed movie and a worthy contender for your dvd collection reviewbot score 45,intelligence
is a neat thriller that isnt always 100 realistic but its wellmade with an interesting storyline and a underrated performance from matt damon the story begins with damons character in the water with two bullet holes in his back how did he get in the ocean who shot him why was he shot who is he it asks many questions and the mystery of the storyline keeps you invested in whats going on on screen you really get to the roots of the jason bourne character here which is the whole point of the identity part of the title you get down in his skin and he learns who he is as you do its a terrific actionthriller 85  9,intelligence
this movie is very good the story goes well and matt damon deserved to be jason bourne the movie is filled with action and a lot of car chases when jayson has 2 bullets on his back he cant remember anything about the violent past jason bourne sees that he is a very dangerous man who is very skilled he needs to find the truth and his identity the truth is that hes an elite government agent when you watch this movie its gonna have nonstop action go see it now you will be very entertained and will keep you on the edge of your seat i recommend this to everyone have fun with this action packed movie d ill give this movie a 910,intelligence
looking back now is an alluring string of pearls i can watch once a year wo getting bored which is no mean feat for a flick in 2002 i joyfully assumed that any sequel would keep the level of excellency but bourne ii and iii are pitiful hells of devaluing pukeevoking rapid cuts only sedated oafs may acclaim which abbreviates percosoma a popular but rather quirky cinematic infestation with the potential to ruin any otherwise watchable film the trivia of the bourne supremacy proudly states that the average length of a shot is 19 seconds overdose of percosoma but the bourne ultimatum even tops it by the numbers anyway i seriously wonder why this newmillennium classic is not among the imdb top 100 with memento rightfully ranking 29 and the last and imho worst of the trilogy the bourne ultimatum on 154 by todays date this chart certainly suffers from its own peculiar sort of mental flawall this must be langley again trying to alter the publics view on the bourne case ,intelligence
this is based on the extended explosive edition dvd release i have not read the novel myselfso i cannot make many comparisons nor comment on the quality of either as a different version of the same tale but i know enough about it to realize that a lot of it was abandoned when making this if you want a retelling that stays closer to the book watch the 1988 miniseries with that out of the way this is a very smart highly realistic and entertaining spy film not to mention one of the best of them mainstream audiences will be able to follow it and piece it together and the wellwritten plot is not overly convoluted the pacing is marvelous this is never boring and it lets you breathe acting is strong and convincing damon captures the expert knowledge and the vulnerable nature of the role and has us believing in both aspects the characters are wellwritten and credible this is welltold concise without requiring a second viewing to understand it the dialog is wellwritten and delivered impeccably the handtohand fighting is awesome the shootouts are cool and this is frankly exciting throughout the sequences are fresh and unpredictable its fast intense engaging wellchoreographed and stylish without being excessively so there is good suspense in this it keeps you interested throughout there are few clichs in this this has a little strong language and mild violence the disc comes with several concise featurettes covering the vital areas the music video for mobys extreme ways a van helsing theatrical trailer a few deleted scenes and the bookends an alternate opening and ending with introductory interviews i recommend this to fans of those who were involved in making the movie cia flicks andor storydriven actionthrillers 810,intelligence

its been 7 years since its original release i regret for not watching this on cinema since this movie is very good and worth to spend some bucks for but i was only 14 when it was released p the photography was nice the story line is unpredictablei havent read the novel yet but i believe this movie was really well made from the novel ill read the novel later ill continue on watching the second movie as i believe that will be exactly as cool as this onei highly recommend this movie even though it has been 7 years since the release no recent movie that have the same impression as this one i think,intelligence
what i have to say about this movie is that i have really enjoyed watching it for various reasons first of all there is that interesting plot about his past which now seems to forgotten and for some reason he is wanted dead however with intense action and thrill moments he makes it out alive  how originalthe good points about this movie is that it was well executed good plot and scripts overall with quite some intensive action moments the soundtracks also went quite well with the movie  some of the points which i did not like include the fact that his past is not quite well evolved with various holes about his past remaining unfilled however you can get a good idea of what is going on one more thing about the ending is that it seems that he was left to live scotchfree for no apparent reason in the end one more thing is that how could such a trained professional fail to achieve his mission just because because hes seen kids well that is not really a reason for a professional to fail and if he failed why is he wanted dead so badly otherwise i have quite enjoyed the movie and am glad that such a story is set on a trilogy rather than just one movie i recommend this movie to anyone looking for some action with a compelling and thrilling plot overall great,intelligence
is a solid spy movie with exceptional performances by the cast especially matt damon as the lead jason bourne a former government trained assassin recovering from amnesia who tries to unlock the secrets behind his mysterious past director doug liman is admirable in making this giving audiences nearly everything they could except from one of the type of films matt damon is terrific as bourne and he proves himself to be a talented actor especially in the actionfight sequences the rest of the cast including franka potente chris cooper brian cox julia stiles and clive owen in a small role as one of the assassins after bourne are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time the action sequences are intense and somewhat realistic others not so much but thats okay the chases between mostly bourne and people are him are also well executed there is some suspense and a little romance for the women which balances well between the action despite some flaws overall was much better than expected this movie has just enough action some suspense chases thrills and great performances by the cast especially damon who makes worth the time to watch,intelligence
the reason why the bond series had to change and for that bourne needs to be respected i was hostile to this film when it first came out thinking it was going to be no more then the american trying to make their own version of bond much like xxx released in the same year but i so wronghas a simple premise an american assassin jason bourne matt damon has been shot and has amnesia he is found by french fishermen and he goes on a quest to discover his identity his bosses at the cia believed he had died and thought his mission was a failure they were are shocked to see he shows up in zurich and they try to hunt bourne down bourne is shocked to see he has a number of passports thousands of dollars in cash and a gun in a swiss bank security box he discovery he has a nack for language fluent in german and french physically fit and can fight without even thinking he acts like a spy without him knowing it also checking for exits and threats in switzerland he befriends a gypsy marie franka potente he takes him to paris where he lived there the hunt hots up with local police and cia top agents after them they have to hide and work together to solve the mysterythey are a lot of positives in this film it has an excellent cast its matt damons first blockbuster and he is good as the spy who is both cold and emotion and also one high alert their is franka potente a very good actress and is a woman caught in the middle of this chase chris cooper is good as the villain and there are other excellent supporting actors brain cox clive owen adewale akinnuoyeagbaje and julia stiles is the directors doug liman first blockbuster and he shows he is a excellent action director there also some excellent action scene such as the car chase in the mini with ready steady go as the backing song to the fight scenes to the final fight also he doesnt use shaky cam like paul greengrass did in the sequels it also a part of the trend that xmen started out getting an indie director to direct action film and bring strong story to a film there is a fantastic script by tony gilroy and william blake herron they wrote a very intelligence thoughtful script that makes you thing there are themes of memory nature vs nurture the all seeing eye of the cia and their willingness to be ruthless it is also unusual for a blockbuster because it makes out that the americans or at least the cia as the bad guys it has a leftwing political stance which greengrass continuesits an excellent film and needs multipal viewings to truly understand it,intelligence

jason bourne damon is suffering from amnesia he finds a bullet in his back with a bank code and sets on a journey to find his identitywhen you see a body lying in the middle of the sea completely motionless you know youre in for something special this opening shot uses a great mix of colour and direction with a sweet silence to create a sombre mood that will instantly engross youmatt damon the departed is jason bourne the man lying in the middle of the sea as a boat picks bourne up we feel his memory loss and what follows is a flowing narrative filled with an intensity and interestdamons depiction of robert ludlums character is wonderful silent and professional everything that was intendedthere have been many debates over bourne and bond the british franchise is light hearted has gadgets and has an overwhelming use of action encoded bourne however is more serious professional and realistic this first instalment of the series for example has realism down to the ground there are consequences to actions there isnt much action and there are no clichs not to mention this 2002 hit climaxes with so many unanswered questions you will be ripping the bourne supremacy out of its case without a second thought recent bonds casino royale and quantum of solace have been compared to the bourne series as they are darker and more serious but these 3 films are much more sophisticated than bond will ever bethis is by far more realistic than any bond though the bond films are funnier and have cool gadgets the bournes have more realism carefully choosing the action sequences and giving a highly intriguing portrayal of the american government and ciathe narrative is consistent and justifies the genre beautifully the film dives into genres of mystery crime thriller and drama giving a wide perspective of realism of its ownthe whole concept of finding his true identity invites viewers into the narrative and will leave you shocked come the chilling end the dealings with the police fall into the crime area and the dramatic turn of events involving beautifully directed memory flashbacks give this film a high dramatic turnthe music score is wonderful playing softly in the background it gives the film a strong intensity feeling and mobys extreme ways finishes the film off beautifully,intelligence
this film is exciting from the start where a man who has lost his memory is pulled from the mediterranean until the end where he confronts his erstwhile employersmatt damon plays jason bourne an assassin with amnesia who must piece together who he is from the contents of a safety deposit box in a swiss bank unfortunately for him he is spotted and his cia bosses assume something is wrong with him and attempt to arrest him when he visits the us consulate he escapes and pays a german girl franka potente to drive him to paris they realise just how much danger they are in when an assassin attacks them in bournes apartment from then on he must play cat and mouse with the cia and the french police until he can finally identify and confront his former employers at the endthe acting is solid throughout both from the two main characters and from secondary characters especially clive owen in a small roll as another assassin sent after borne it is also nice to have a leading lady who while pretty isnt an exotic unrealistic beauty like we tend to get in another spy franchise the action never really lets up we have plenty of fights and an exciting car chase where bourne must evade the paris police while driving a clapped out old mini if you enjoy spy thrillers id certainly recommend this as well as the other two films in the trilogy it is good to see that a really exciting film doesnt need to resort the excessive swearing or violence which would have taken it above the 12 certificate,intelligence
bourne identity has got to be one of the most excitingly gripping movies ive ever seen though ive never been a top fan of extremely plain action movies this one has got to be an exception bourne identity as played by a rising brilliant actor matt damon who played jason bourne an extremely trained assassin whose affiliation is a clandestine even among cia offices the story begins with jason bourne matt damon of course whom he abandoned a mission due to unexpected psychological disturbances in his brain however his desertion lead to his lifes danger as his target manage to kill him instead but he narrowly escaped as the story progresses we learn how jason came into being and went to search for pieces of his past those who manage treadstone a secret operative section of cia where jason bourne belongs manage to track him down for two slightly unsure reasons one to hold him custody and bring him into questioning about his failure to complete his recent mission or second to eliminate him because of the threat he brought which was tantamount to their suspicion of bourne betraying them for he recently abandoned a missioni must admit that this movie is one decent project and i never expect matt damon to excel very well and appear to perfectly fit the character of jason bourne superb certainly for his uncanny character makes the story successful and effectively eyecatching for actionconnoisseur viewers this indeed deserve a neat sequel,intelligence
jason bourne movies really represents the action movie of this decade great character and plot linesi hope they can keep making it and put out a new bourne movie every 2 years i believe this movie about espionage is as real as it gets the incorporation of technological advancements clear truthful character personality the movie is really greatto think of it bourne is not like bond who is always invincible surrounded by girls the only inconsistent plot is about marie who died and disappeared from the series so suddenly but it didnt stop me from enjoying the movies all in all bourne is the only movie that i really enjoyed and bought dvds of the past 3 years,intelligence
this is perhaps one of the best crimethrillers  itself a remake of a miniseries in the early 80s with at that time one of the most popular actors r chamberlain and j smith  both again  based upon the eponymous novel by rludlum  in the movie  we can spot similarities with bond movies and the other like the heat  collateral  except that bourne has perhaps introduced the genre of almost completely real storyline and fastpaced  nonstop action set in european capitals  here paris   the main idea is to discover the identity of bourne  who is in the beginning found floating in the sea  what follows is breath  taking action  claustrophobic chases  elements that are coming together slowly like in a jigsaw  and the final  nightmarish realization of ones life and mission  you are nothing but a 30 million  government property     acting by everyone is topnotch  from mr m  damon  to mr c cooper to  in my modest opinion  mme f potente  who is  perhaps  one of the most underrated acting talents in the world cinema  recommend elementary particles  not to mention her girlnextdoor magnetism  the movie was a big surprise hit  understandably followed by two sequels of a lower  but still acceptable  quality  why did his heartthrob have to die  no    briefly  the movie brought back the good old storytelling  where shocks happen all of a sudden  and before you know it  here comes another surprise  it would be interesting to see some more ludlums novels turned into movies  like matarese countdown  ,intelligence
i have read the book and i enjoyed it very much it was a great book worth reading for everyone who is a fan of spy books and like this the movie is good for fans of spy movies as this is one of the best it was great to see the great storyline unfold and they do it with so much care that it really serves the book one hefty tributethe movie starts off well written and the action scenes are very well done you can see at parts just how good ofa movie it is with every scene the directing can be seen trying to reach a little further and makes the movies fight scenes worth while every timedont get me wrong this is not the ultimate movie but it is definitely one of the best action films for sure and the bourne supremacy was extremely good as well third was ok but lacked the charisma this one hadoverall action and spy fans will love this version of the classic spy book and they will also love the sequels that come after it i cant wait to see the 4th one come to the big screen the bourne leagcy,intelligence
i think 2002 was a year for great action films spiderman the lord of the rings the two towers and of course its one of the few action films in the last decade or so to really make you think its got twists its got turns its got matt damon what it doesnt have is a shaky cameranow bare with me im saying that in a more scornful tone than you might imagine a lot of people dont like supremacy or ultimatum because of the shaky camera work i however like to down identity for not having shaky camera work why there are several reasonsfirst the bourne series is one that should make you think while having your heart pounding to nearexplosion at the same time it should push both of your most valuable organs to boilingpoint without a camera that moves around as if you were struggling to run just like the characters i doubt your heart will race very farsecond bourne is like an animal he moves on instinct alone because thats all he was left with now i dont know about you but the normal camera work in identity makes the film and the character seem too tame too solitary despite the violence a camera can change more than most people realize in a filmthirdly the shaky cam is definitive of the bourne series at least in the last two every action series has something another doesnt and what the bourne series has is a an excellent storyline b realistic character development c believable government action and d shaky camera workso in that i find that identity is just too tame to really capture the true bourne in other words the identity is lost until it is found in supremacy it feels just like the italian job with the tame camera maybe its because bourne is still a whiteknight good guy in this one he wants to be tameotherwise is the fantastic beginning to an excellent and enthralling trilogy its got the best romance story in any of them and quite possibly the most believable characters in any action film im glad the helm was passed to paul greengrass from doug liman who went on to do decent work with mr and mrs smith and jumperits fantastic and that ending song extreme ways by moby is just too damn catchy to miss,intelligence
is a tight gripping spy thriller that is loosely based on the novel by robert ludlum and efficiently directed by doug liman the story involves a jettisoned and almost dead man floating in the mediterranean sea and is scooped up by fisherman after an onboat quick surgery and recovery the man who wakes up on the boat matt damon has but a single clue to who he is a capsule implanted in his body that displays a swiss bank account number he travels to zurich to check it out and discovers not only an american passport that tells him hes jason bourne but also a veritable collection of multinational passports in other identities there are also wads of cash and a gunwe briskly learn through the cia some background detail about jason bourne is a top notch cia assassin part of a hushhush project called treadstone the cia led by ted conklin chris cooper and ward abbott brian cox are onto him for a mission gone awry that jason did that was compromised the cia unleashes a band of assassins that chase him throughout europejason bourne who now has amnesia has no idea why he is being chased and hunted down during his gambit of staying a step ahead of the cia from being captured he accidentally runs into marie kreutz franka potente a young vagabond who eventually gets intertwined with him through an incident and becomes his only trusted allymatt damon is excellent in a role that requires him to be simultaneously smart but baffled competent but confused lethal but compassionate franka potente is an inspired choice here as bournes eventual loveinterest and adds warmth to her earthy sexual appeal whilst on the run bourne discovers his hidden talent and whenever caught in an imbroglio he uses his impressive martialarts skills combined with superior fighting skills and a natural ability to size up a room  ability to quickly adapt to a situation and make astute observations of the surroundings the script is brazenly written and works well with the pacing and effective storytelling doug limans direction is fantastic and has a great eye for detail with some great oldstyle action on display is a refreshing change for a spy thriller,intelligence
this was the best matt damon movie i have seen for a long time this was such a great movie i want to buy twenty copies of it theres not too much action but theres enough to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie after you plug the dvd in you dvd player youll not stop till its over matt damon was in a lot of great movies starting off with the departed which was great experience too all in all if you dont have this movie get it it is definitely worth watching over and over this is definitely matt damon at his best the suspense was the thing that kept me watching if you look away for a moment you will miss something important great movie,intelligence
i enjoyed this it had been one of those movies i had heard about but had never gotten around to there are times when it seems that matt damon is such a cold fish ala the good shepherd that one has trouble getting connected to him in this film he is really believable as a man who has all the training of a killing machine but a soft side that bears exploring the character is put into situations he cant understand but can only react to he has compassion but little understanding what an interesting role if theres a shortcoming its that the motivations of the bad folks arent all that clear its still a delight to watch his relationship with his ionly needaride partner develop there is a level of subtlety that most films of this type dont have the car chases are spectacular but for once they backed down on the pyrotechnics i appreciated this,intelligence
it really takes the espionage thriller to a new and much superior level instead of ridiculously over the top action with whatever the highest form of special effects are available at the time bourne is very lowkey with natural and realistic action and no visual effects thats one of the main reasons why i love it so much it feels authentic sure the backplot is a little farfetched but the way everything plays out from it is so natural and realistic that im just blown away damon is brilliant as usual and plays the most convincing amnesiac ive ever seen on film eat it memento fanboys franka potente is gorgeous and also very natural chris cooper and brian cox are easily two of the best and possibly the two most commanding actors working right now and putting them together on screen was just an explosion waiting to happen the casting of this film was brilliant the car chase is possibly the greatest of all time only supremacys can top it and i always admire the use of paul oakenfolds ready steady go in a film although collateral did use it better my only big complaint about the film is the complete change in the story from the novel although i do understand why it was done they had to translate the cold war era of the novel to modern times and it loses a lot of its details in the process but they replaced them nice and neatly they keep the central plot the same just change around a bulk of the details if you hadnt read the novels you wouldnt notice the flaw at all and think that it was very properly handled very entertaining and very authentic one of the best films of the weak 2002 for sure,intelligence
thank you doug liman for making the movie and thank you matt damon for this flawless actioni read critics that hate the movie and their main point of criticism is that movie does not follow the original novels story i have not read the book and therefore i really happy with the moviei understand who read and loved the book they normally expect the movie to be like the book but obviously director and damon has chanced things i mention damon because he took part in fighting with the studio when they wanted the cut some of the scenes but the director and damon insisted keeping this scenes farmhouse scenes so both the director and damon believed in the movie and those changes created a easy to follow always keeping your attention up movie but it also gives the plot and its messages so cleari always like american movies that are shot in europe the director used very nice views of roads buildings streets and so on movie flows like a nice stream and its logic never failsmatt damon is brilliant as always hes playing his role in great confidence fight scenes are very real chase scene was nice and it reminds italian job in a smart wayso as a whole this movie is really good sequels proofed to be better though,intelligence
one of the best thrillers ever made it has the reflective quality of le carres earlier postwar spy flicks like the spy who came in from the cold and the tv dramas with george smiley but with plenty of shootemups and car chases the downbeat mini trashing the massed cops of paris is so much more impressive than bond with all his gadgetry pulling the same stunt great setpieces but the best of all is the body surfing down the stairwell unbelievable matt damon has a brooding presence which fits in well with the storyline and franka potente makes a sexy and believable sidekick and im glad they got together in the end leaving a suitably open ending for the sequel the story neatly turns the usual spy shtick on its head with the bad guys as his own side we all know now how true that is now should have been called he doesnt know hes bourne but id go a million miles for a lousy pun,intelligence
a very worthy addition to the bourne series  provided that you like the breakneck pace we found it very thrilling form beginning to end  really gripping  and a decent amount of thinking to balance some very good chase and fight scenesthe art is in the details and here the details are well thought through it looks and feels right and just makes the time fly byvery exciting and very watchable  just concentrate for the first 15 minutes and youll be up and running the plot is complicated enough to get you involved and the action is mainly feasible given bournes traininghighly watchable,intelligence
much has been said about this 1st series of bourne trilogy where i am also now a participant is the story of an excia assassin turned amnesiac who failed in his mission and shot up with two bullets when he was treated by a doctor in the ship he recovered from his unconsciousness but with a problem of amnesia as he completely forgot his own every identity then here is the beginning of his travel from one city to another for recovering his identity he starts from zurich then paris really this should be ranked among the top 50 suspensethriller movies of the present decade of behavior from 20002010 due to its nonstop serious plot actions and character roles i personally did not notice any similarities with james bonds movies as both are made in their own ways except that both these are spy thriller but many differences are there like this bourne is much based on reality and innocence while bond possesses many special powers and orders from the head he meets many new girls in new places surprisingly both their names are with j and b james bond and jason bourne matt damons portrayal as jason bourne is simply superb and he perfectly matched with robert ludlums evergreen character his childish cute look with serious expressions pulled the audiences into better prospects it was in 1996 when i noticed one of my school teachers borrowed a book of the bourne series from a public library i was innocent then about novels and stories except comics who could imagine that one day i would be one of this bournes fans the movie has no much nonsense romance and love scenes which were also only in need to clarify bournes identity yeah franka potente must be appreciated for her newly presence in american hollywood community and perhaps this made the movie more acceptable to the audiences she looks matured and normal in her role and ignites the proceeding of the story julia stiles as a cia operative agent in paris also satisfies with her side and significant role casting on the lead actors was an excellent work of doug liman i found the most turning on dialogue was from conklin when he says to bournei send you because you dont exist this sentence thrills on the importance and the quality of a spy assassin jason bourne along these clive owens short but interesting presence also need to be mentioned he clearly proved that he is fit for james bond,intelligence

in many ways revolutionized the expectations of people that love spy films how is it different from the runofthemill action films i dont think youll find another action film let alone action series that is as story driven as the bourne films and in particular a mystery begins to unfold right from the first scene and youre caught up in this world of jason bourne and youre discovering everything as he is discovering everything making you feel like youre right there with him and feeling empathy for his character while being shocked and riveted by his realization of what he is is exotic and brilliantly filmed in such incredible european locations as france spain czech republic and italy and if you think that doesnt make a differencewatch because the locations are something that really makes what it is add all this espionage and action together and they still find time to establish a meaningful and very powerful romance between bourne and a woman he randomly meets and its a relationship so significant that it remains a driving force in bournes life right up through the trilogymatt damon has had some good roles and has proved himself a very versatile actor but his role as jason bourne may stick with him forever because he does an incredible job capturing this cold blooded assassin with actual empathy and this strong silent deadly and yet compassionate person his performance is amazing and bourne is movie history franka potente plays the girl in the wrong place at the wrong time marie kreutz who becomes romantically involved with bourne i dont find potente beautiful in the typical hollywood sense and in fact shes almost kind of plain compared to some starlets and yet thats what makes her and damon have incredible chemistry and a very real romance together she also blends in with her surroundings and has this very unique and exotic european look she is german by heritage chris cooper is brilliant as the angry and forceful cia villain alexander conklin who is desperate to get rid of bourne before it uncovers his involvement with an undercover assassin project equally as brilliant is brian cox as conklins coconspirator julia stiles makes a small cameo entrance into the series as logistics expert nicky and although she doesnt have a big role she becomes significant to the cast and is often tied to the series also watch for clive owen in a small role as assassin sent to kill bourne in the english country sidetells its story and doesnt apologize for not being the typical blow everything up non stop action type of film but it certainly has its share of action and some incredibly choreographed fight scenes damons bourne is a far more brilliant hero and doesnt resort to simply using a gun but rather is always a step or two or five ahead of his foes and is so well trained its just thrilling to watch him get out of every situation when it comes down to it he can kick some serious ass and the fight scenes are incredible and his abilities are unparalleled making this just an incredible action spy thriller with an intense story that starts a great mystery that spans three films with each installment of the bourne films they get better and better but this is where it all starts and its a stone cold classic and a must see for anyone who thinks they know the spy genre because this revolutionized it 8510,intelligence

is one of the better films ive lately seen i just finished watching it cause i didnt got to see it in theatre and i was really surprised theres no overload of effects like in a lot other movies of our time the movie is basically exciting because of the plot and the characters matt damon and franka potente make a harmonizing couple the tension is always on a very high level because you just know what jason bourne knows and that makes the beauty of the film im really looking forward for the bourne supremacy which opens in germany on october 21st,intelligence
note i havent read the book so i have no idea how the film comparesminor spoilers aheadbased on robert ludlums bestselling novel tells the story of jason bourne a blackops agent working off the map for the united states government when a mission goes awry bourne matt damon is left with a blank memory as he follows the clues to reclaim hisuhidentity bourne runs into trouble with the authorities and teams up with maria franka potente a transient young woman in whom he finds his only friend as the two race around europe bourne slowly rediscovers himself while his supervisors in the us attempt to track him downthe premise of bourne identity is ideal to use a classic narrative technique placing the audience in the shoes of a character a la the matrix the protagonist here is completely ignorant therefore the world and story of the movie can be unfolded and explained without slowing the pace because information new to the audience is also new to bourne when a second confused character maria is introduced that factor is doubled permitting bourne himself to introduce both parties to his knowledge of the espionage world this method sucks the viewer into the story and creates a greater attachment than in a standard flick adding to the attraction of the film is matt damons everyman appeal damon has never been an action hero nor does he look a stereotypical beefy action star along the lines of schwarzenegger but in this case the casting is perfect because bourne himself is uncomfortable in his own body damon nails the part by maintaining a paranoid state of mind with perpetually moving eyes and nervous gestures the germanborn potente is another casting coup as her unique appearance is a breath of fresh air eschewing cookiecutter american beauty for an earthier healthier doeeyed look that is refreshingly effective with a supporting cast completed by such reliables as chris cooper clive owen and brian cox the movies acting is scarcely noticeable which creates a believable world of espionagethat world is a paranoid world one that director doug liman swingers cinematographer oliver wood die hard 2 and crew represent on screen very well wood utilizes constantly moving often handheld cameras and the editing team of saar kline the thin red line  christopher rouse the italian job features jumpy nervous editing all of which brilliantly emulate bournes fragile yet kinetic mental state speaking of the italian job thats a decent comparison for bourne identity although the latter is edgier and more complex both have a european feel with bournes obviously stemming from the entirely european setting the oldfashioned yet physically beautiful locations are complemented by a rhythmic soundtrack that never soars but frequently hangs and lingers as the story proceeds bourne identity is classified as an action flick but the action is decidedly different than that in other movies of the same genre containing very few special effects or cgi the action centers on motion and pursuit endowing the film with a edgier more physical tone that is highlighted by a stellar car chase set in the middle of the movie the sequence featuring a beatup mg racing through the streets and alleys of paris is the best cinematic chase since at least the rock if not long before that the catandmouse concept of the entire film is encapsulated in this quality set piece which is more than just eye candy serving also as a key turning point in the plot with surprisingly little facetoface conflict present scenes like this one must infuse the story with suspense and that they do very well while developmental parts are naturally but enjoyably slower an underlying tension drives the entire story because it often spontaneously explodes to life early that possibility persists throughout moving it along like a peoplemover at a slow and steady pace that doesnt seem dangerous until something goes wrong bottom line rarely does an actionbased movie feature such a compelling story and human characters 8 of 10 for one of the most underrated and best action movies in recent years,intelligence
having read the book i felt the movie was going to be a serious letdown  it was just the opposite for me  it was engrossing from the very start and held your interest the whole way through and i cannot envisage missing the sequel the bourne supremacy   the scenery was spectacular at all locations while the performance of matt damon was really good  he was excellent in the talented mr ripley and he followed that up extremely well here  the supporting cast of all relative unknowns did firstclass jobs  this is a classic case of where it was better to see the film after having read the book  i have just read some of the goofs printed about this movie which in hindsight was a mistake as one tends to watch out for them rather than enjoying the entertainment for what it is,intelligence
at first when i glimpsed at this i wasnt so sure about seeing matt damon in this kind of role  but when i finally saw the film i realized i was just paranoid as its a very good action film that uses the european car chase formula and does it in a respectable fashion  and theres a fight scene that was cleared for a pg13 movie when it possibly passes for an r i see how this even resembles the italian job in a sense but i am aware that this came out first  but anyway its not like its a bad thing matt damon does surprisingly well in his fight scenes which are shot from many angles to take the burden off of the choreographer  matter fact he pulls it off so well that i tend to forget hes not even a martial artist as he had to gone through serious training for this role  for a pg13 film it is relatively graphic at times910,intelligence
like others i missed this in the theater i have to say im glad i finally caught it i had read the book once in my early teens 198085 time takes its toll so i only remembered the broad strokes of the book never did see the tv version so i cant compare themi really did enjoy the movie as a whole damon did a good job with bournes confusion and sense of loss hes no anthony hopkins but he was effective the action scenes were well done the guy coming through the glass at bournes paris place really surprised me good build up the scene with clive owen gave both characters a little humanity to empathize withi do have to say the bournemarie romance could have used a little more development but oh well its an action flick right and julia stiles character seemed very superfluous i think they missed an opportunity for a good subplot but maybe shell show in the sequel all in all id say a solid 4 out 5,intelligence
is based on a robert ludlum book and manages to represent the essence of the story without being too literal while also managing that rather more difficult task of being a good screen adaptationthe emphasis here is on the action the whole who am i question only serves as a plot movement to kickstart some great sequences its not going to come as any shock to you that mr bourne is a cia operative or that he knows exactly how to take care of himself or anyone unfortunate to get in his waythe action scenes themselves are nothing new yet they are handled with such skill by the director that you never feel like youve been here beforeanother of the films strong points is its performance from the main star matt damon breaks very nicely from type and leaves you feeling that he very well could kill you with just his little finger a good supporting cast also adds credibility with franka potente of run lola run fame and chris cooper who recently won an oscar for best supporting actor in adaptationif youre looking for some good solid spy action than look no further proves to be a very satisfying fare into familiar territory with good performances great direction and a particularly good car chase through the streets of paris,intelligence
is a superb spy film gritty realistic suspenseful and surprisingly actionpacked bourne is the kind of spy movie a bond movie should be but never is at least in its entirety nearly as convoluted as spy game another great spy film bourne surpasses it managing to remain both coherent and interesting throughout lushly photographedterrifically photographed and choreographed superbly acted and beautifully scored bourne is a big success in no small part to matt damon  damon is incredibly convincing as an emotional automaton who one minute oozes schoolboy looks and personal humanity while in the next effortlessly kills or disables scores of adversaries  during one such dispatching damon utilizes the most incredible stunt ive ever seen and makes us believe he could do it the only improvement i could see could have been made to bourne would be a little more explanation regarding the treadstone programming  what little explanation is provided gets lost in the action and suspense  otherwise this movie is darn near perfecti can hardly wait to see damon reprise this role i just wonder what producers kennedymarshall and director doug liman could do to match much less top this i hope imdb members who read my review enjoy this movie as much as i did,intelligence
far superior to the 1988 tv miniseries this current offering improved on the original quite successfully i personally wish the story would have continued for at least another halfhour if not a full hour more matt damon is much more believable than richard chamberlain and franka potente completely outshines jaclyn smithbecause of how spy dramas suspense thrillers have evolved over the past several years nowadays youre never quite sure whether or not our hero will survive this allows for a heightened sense of suspensedoug liman directed a great thriller which i will watch again and again and i thank him for the lovely tour of paristhe cinemaphotography was superbone minor disappointment was that there was not enough of clive owen who is a truly great actor and deserves more screen time,intelligence
if you actually read the book by robert ludlum enjoy it then take a step back from it consider two things1 thia book was written years ago in 19802carlos ilyich ramirez aka carlos the jackal  was still at large in 1980  he is not now as he was jailed by french authorities once again many years agoyou cannot take a theme that was resolved in real life and superimpose it into fiction and expect your audience to respect the work  as carlos was the central theme of all three booksthe bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatumall excellent by the way it is both painfully obvious and decididly necessary to change the central theme of the film to reflect the secondary theme of the book ie what national secrets could this rogue agentcia assasin impart to the wrong peoplegovernment if coersed bribed or whatevermy opinion is aside from the obvious and necessary meandering from the carlos angle the film is a decent and effective attempt at bringing the thrust of bournes struggle to find who and what he is whilst avoiding shadowy hitmen at every junctureyou simply cannot take a 500600 page book written in 1980as a technoespionage thriller leave it entirely intact and have it still appeal to a mass marketi went into this movie with an open mind as i usually do and whilst i would have liked to see more depth to clive owens and the other assains characters and more explaination behind the purpose of treadstone 71 i feel this is still a movie to enjoy so i recommend you give it a shot,intelligence
when i first heard of this movie i thought it was just another action film and when i heard it had matt damon in the lead i thought the film producers had gone bonkers to cast matt damon as an action hero besides i never liked his acting but boy did my opinion change after watching this film matt damon isnt only good hes terrific as the former cia assassin on the run from his boss the movie too gives in a solid punch what makes this movie really click is that it doesnt try to prove it is different from the regular action flicks in fact it shows that it is just that it is its terrific execution which makes it worth watching over and over again doug limans perfect direction takes this film to great heights and the action sequences are too be seen to be believed theyre just beautiful terrific and the car chases are really awesome the only really negative point in this film is frank potente as the gypsy girl who gives jason bournematt damon a ride to paris and as you would expect become his love angle she just isnt upto the mark infact she looks like sleepwalking through the entire film the strategy of casting a lesser known actress opposite matt damon wasnt bad but the director should have thought about casting a lesser knowngood actress and not just the former opposite the extremely superb matt damon she looks like a drag another positive point in this movie is its cinematography the lush locations of paris and switzerlnd have been captured beautifully all in all this is one action movie you wont want to miss terrific from start to finish this is undoubtedly the action movie of the year,intelligence
there arent too many spy movies like this in which the hero is not the james bond type whos going to save the world from the ultimate supervillainmatt damon portrays jason bourne one of his many identities a regular guy who lost his memory and is about to discover hes a genuine lethal weapon he fights not to prevent the villain to take over the world but to regain his memory to find out his true identity and in the process change his previous way of life all he has to do now is avoid the other agents trained like himself trying to eliminate himi liked this movie very much the addition of franka potente to it was a really nice plus and seeing the whole story staged in europe was a very nice change from la and new york but the main reason i liked it so much is matt damons performance hes one the rightful heirs of future hollywood hes shown that he can play any character convincingly even when the role is a van damme type of characterthe action is good the suspense is good the chasings are good the performances are good just go see it,intelligence
when i first saw the trailer on the cinema i thought it was going to be another crappy film based on a book  but as there was nothing else on i went to see it  i was so pleased that i didthe film is a cross between mission impossible 1 but without any of the ludicrous plot twistsmasks etc ronin the way in which it is filmed and frantic but with all the good action bits of james bondthe female lead is believable without being the usual dozy token femalematt damon is great as the action hero with a consciencebut perhaps the best bit of the film is the car chase that is just sooo cool with an obvious nod to the italian job  it is just the best car chase since that film or perhaps the french connectionso just go and see it  but dont ask too many questions or youll see how ridiculous the premise actually is,intelligence
is an intelligent actionpacked edgeofyourseat thriller i dont think its nearly as vacuous as some critics have indicated the story behind the action isnt deep but it is interesting and engaging and it is complex enough to offer some real surprises and characters that are not what they seem as for the action its some of the best ive seen a long time  i like the handheld camera work that gives a jumpy tense feel to the action without making the audience seasickmatt damons jason bourne is in many ways an antibond and his sidekick marie played by the german actress franka potente is an antibondgirl bourne suffering from amnesia and trying to figure out who he is while protecting himself and marie from assassins is too busy for double entendres and marie always appears fully dressed instead of a classy astin martin with missiles and ejection seats our heroes have a small red box on wheels instead of saving the world from a sinister plot while all the while remaining suave and sexy they are nervously trying to save their lives in truly tense situations marie even unromantically vomits when she sees a dead woman the romance between bourne and marie develops slowly and believably and it is marie that gets things going minor spoiler when they arrive at bournes paris apartment marie gives bourne a look that says id like to stay wow a movie with a character that can speak with good acting and expression rather than through obvious dialogue and bourne awkwardly invites her to come up to the apartment with him when marie says that maybe she should just leave because bourne will forget her anyway he responds by saying how can i forget you youre the only person i know aw you cant get any more romantic than that  end spoilerthe villains including cia bureaucrats and assassins are realistic and creepy the always good chris cooper and clive owen as the professor do especially well all of the characters even the minor ones are carefully portrayed and it seemed to me that there was sympathy in the audience for all of the characters this and other elements give the movie a realistic feel  director doug liman who speaks french fluently used only local crews while filming in prague and paris to help create a real european atmosphere real us marines play the soldiers that go after bourne in the american embassy there are no gratuitous explosions that ring false or silly action sequences theres only one explosion and in that scene bourne uses it as a clever advantage over his opponent  some complain and nitpick about plot holes but i think identity is much more realistic throughout than sum of all fears iswatch for some fun details in the film at the end when two characters are having a conversation look to the right of the screen over one of the characters left shoulder to see what has become of the red bag that is prominent throughout the film and enjoy the great score by composer john powellthis is matt damons first role as an actionthriller leading man and he proves to be more than up to the task while jack ryan is busy entangling himself in clichs jason bourne is kicking some serious patootie  if youre looking for a good thriller skip sum of all fears and check out ,intelligence
in one of the more anticipated thrillers released this year matt damon takes on the role of a cia assassin who has failed an assassination mission only to wake up and find himself on a strange fishing boat with no memory of who or where he is or how he even got there it starts off under this immediately interesting premise with damons character progressively educating himself about his identity through the gradual realization of his own ignorance to the true reality of who he is the more he learns the more he realizes that he doesnt know as the saying goes and we are more than willing to tag along and make all of these thrilling discoveries with himthe movie has a remarkable amount of strong points but almost as many weak points it grows a little frustrating after a while as we learn how much marie is willing to put up with in order to stay with this guy its kind of important that shes there because as he said in the most amusing line in the film shes the only person he knows on the other hand its hard to imagine that someone as goodlooking as franka potente has been having such a hard time finding a boyfriend that she is willing to go through the car chases and gunfights and explosions that are involved with her new friend who hasnt told her his name because he didnt even know it himself and why did he pay her 20000 for the ride to paris did that serve any purpose in the film other than illustrating the massive amount of money that he has at his disposal  on the one hand its easy to see how weak the scriptwriting is when we consider the real logistics of marie deciding to stay by jasons side if that is his real name through all of this mess but on the other hand we are willing to forgive things like that because the rest of the movie is so good some of the action scenes are a little extensive but even most of those are forgivable there is a scene for example where bourne pushes a mans body off of a flight of stairs and over a drop of four or five stories is able to concentrate enough to shoot a guy a couple of flights down and then uses the body as a sort of cushion to break his fall this is something that ive always wondered about i cant remember why but ive wondered why i havent seen someone do this in an action movie before maybe now i know why now if bourne is capable of doing half the things that weve seen him do in this movie im more than willing to believe that he could pull something like this off although the landing didnt look real at all now all i need is to see more people simply shooting the guy whos holding a gun to a hostages head demanding escape im sick and tired of seeing cops put their guns down and let the bad guy go instead of just shooting him in the head when they had him in their crosshairs i saw charlie sheen do it in navy seals i just wish more action films would catch on and quit with the weak scripts remember that scene in snatch when mickey oneil threw that first punch and knocked that huge guy out something similar happened in when bourne is sleeping on a bench in a snowcovered park and two police officers come to tell him to move along and he ends up beating them both to the ground before he even really realizes what hes doing this is what makes the movie fun sure its not the most intellectually involved screenplay and its even been done before in almost exactly the same form but its fun to go along with this character as he discovers all of these skills that he has especially since he doesnt even know why he has them spoilers there are times during the film when there are so many possible identities that may each be the real one if there is a real one that it gets confusing as to which identity he is investigating or which one is thought dead by his enemies however whenever this does happen it only serves to concentrate more attention on the action and the physical aspect of the film which is clearly its strongest asset we eventually learn that jason bourne is a 30 million government weapon and if i remember correctly there was nothing in the film to suggest for certain that jason was not some sort of cyborg including that first kiss scene when marie put that first peck on his lips he stood there staring at her for a few moments too long like he was consulting his memory banks trying to figure out how to react in this sort of situation besides if he were a cyborg it would explain his bulletproof shoulder blades  heres a guy that has survived floating for an unknown period of time unconscious in the ocean okay that hints that hes not a cyborg two bullet wounds to the back that would have punctured both lungs and probably his heart if it werent for the abovementioned bulletproof shoulder blades and who can pull all sorts of fight moves that make neo and morpheus look like kids and we are taken along with him as he desperately tries to figure out who he is its not exactly clear who the bad guys is or are in this film which only serves to add to the suspense and fun created within it its an interesting and refreshing change to see the kind of character development that we see in this film where we grow to like and to root for this guy with amnesia only to later learn that he was pretty much the mastermind of the botched assassination attempt given that he cant really be seen as the good guy but i guess that since he only wants to forget all that and start a new life with marie were meant to see him that wayand speaking of which this is the first element of the film where it starts to falter this guy is a trained government assassin yet he is completely derailed by a couple of kids at the crucial point in his mission sure it would not be a pleasant thing to see an african leader murdered in a film in front of his kids but you have to wonder where that 30 million went if he is so easily weakened but if you can look past the questionable female presence in the film questionable only because no woman on earth would go through all this for a good looking guy and the obligatory ending i remember watching the conclusion of all of bournes troubles and just waiting for the impending reunion scene you will get a quality action film there are some scenes where the movie knows its messing up such as when bourne amazingly knows exaclty where the shotgun is in a house that he has only spent one night in but it is always sure to correct itself sometime during the film in this case in the scene where he explains to marie that he knows that the best place to find a gun right now is in the cab of the gray pickup truck out front  of course we cant understand how he could know this but thats beside the point because we arent meant to discover a full understanding of who he was before the assassination attempt is not about who jason bourne was before he lost his memory its about who he is as a human being underneath all of the training that he was given by the government and the purpose of which he no longer understands or believes in he doesnt want to be an assassin he wants a normal life with marie were just here to see the conflict involved in getting rid of one life and starting the other these are very different themes for one movie to deal with which is why it falters at some points but the action and the acting and sheer fastpaced excitement overshadow the lesser elements making a very worthy action thriller,intelligence
i just saw this movie and it will definitely be on my top 10 list for awhile i initially went to see the film because i had heard many good things about it and i wanted to judge the car chase scene for myself i never expected it to be as good as it was matt damon shows that he can hold his own in an action flick franka potente was amazing as marie her real accent could only be heard in certain spots and clive owen who i didnt even know was in the movie was as usual wonderful i would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to spend their 10 on something entertaining,intelligence
got to see this film today and i have to say that i liked it very much  it is not the best spy film ever made and the material seemed like i had seen something like it before  but having said that the thing i really liked about it was that i cared for the characters and how often can you say that these days attack of the clonescase in point matt damon and franka potente were great  i never liked matt damon before maybe because he is a red sox fan and i am from ny but in this movie he was very good even all the supporting players were good but very under used like julia stiles and clive owen clive owen is great why this guy cant get some good roles is beyond me but the thing that topped it all off for me was the great action shots all over europe  that was great  the movie had the feel of the professional but shot in europe  if you like that kind of stuff you will have a good time,intelligence
jason bourne based on the symptoms presenting is having a conflict unconsciously hes instructed to go and kill somebody in the movie he is given the diagnosis of selective dissociative amnesiawhat they did is they had him forget who he was but they allowed him to continue to remember all the training and the things that he learned over timedamons character jason has been trained in selfdefense weapons handling highspeed driving disguise and secret writing communications he knows that hes very attentive and very observanti really enjoyed the scene in the diner when jason is telling marie he doesnt know who he is but he knows that he can name the license plates of all six cars outside and the clothing that people were wearingmaries character is very helpful to bournes character based on his unconscious clash of feelings and what he was doing and being a killer he wouldve made strenuous efforts to create a new identity if he didnt have a penchant for loveand it was his development and his journey into finding the power to feel that was a big part of this movie jason and maries love is a not a classic loveits definitely a relation of two people who walk next to each other interact and cross only several times but not all the timejason is definitely taken by her by her forcefulness and her vigor as shes very much alive where he isnt where he feels lacking any strong emotion at that point he was still struggling to try to get his memory back when you see the sequel or the two parts together it makes sense because evidently jason is still haunted he still has nightmares from things hed endured while on the contrary marie probably is more the active force trying to set up a home for themhes definitely the one who still feels on the run because he still is under constant restraint,intelligence
i saw last night 6402 at a special advanced screening in san francisco  matt damon was introduced at the end of the film and took questions from the audience for about a half hourive read ludlums book and the movie is very loosely based on it essentially this is about a man found floating in the sea near death from gunshot wounds  as the man wakes he has no memory and eventually he finds himself on the run with the aid of a woman he barely knows  unlike the book there is no carlos marie is a gypsy not a banker and the movie is set almost entirely in parisi thought the movies was less of a spy thriller than a movie about two people on the run  there were several lighter moments in the film with damon and franka potente on the run  potente is really good and very funny chris cooper a great character actor doesnt have the greatest lines but delivers them quite well  julia stiles is also in this movie but her role is rather small  clive owen is in the movie as well not driving a bmw though and while his role is small he performs well especially as he talks about his life and sacrificesi thought this film was good entertainment but not greatmatt damon said that he studied martial arts and had weapons training for five months  he did do most of his own stunts  some of the fights scenes were great with an almost matrixlike supersoldier type attitude  there is a great stunt near the end of the movie as bourne makes a move to get down the staircasethe film was shot in paris and the czech republic,intelligence

i didnt really know anything about the character jason bourne other than in general he was some type of modern day james bond type of hero from the novel i knew that they did a tv movie back in the late 80s of the same name and that richard chamberlain played the hero but based on what i did know in no way did i think that matt damon was right for the part of an international superspy i thought he was too young too short too nonathletic looking etc let me just say that i was 100 dead solid wrong damon is exceptional as jason bourne in and it is one of my pleasant surprises in film so far the decade of the 2000s while it is not currently in my very top films of the decade the way the decade is going it could very easily end up in the top 10 because there are about only 2 or 3 other big hollywood films this decade that i think are true modern classics collateral and kill bill vol1 among themis actually a surprisingly simple tale of cia agent jason bourne who loses his memory during a mission gone wrong bourne works for a secret subsection of the cia only known as the treadstone operation this group is led by conklin played by the fine actor chris cooper in a confident performance treadstone seems to specialize in the assassination game doing the cias dirty work by snuffing out potential threats to the us bourne goes missing after the failed mission and conklin at first thinks he may be dead but just to be safe he orders cia moles around the world to be on the lookout for mr bourne in case he pops upbourne does pop up at a bank in zurich where he apparently has a safety deposit box full of fake passports a lot of cash and an automatic weapon this is where he realizes his name is jason bourne and that his home is in paris which is really just a temporary place that bourne was staying while on the assignment that went wrong leading him to lose his memory in the first place while in zurich the mole contacts conklin that bourne showed up and this is when the fun begins he goes to the american embassy in zurich to escape capture but conklin has a mole in there too and the soldiers there try to take him into custody during the confrontation bourne learns that he has all these amazing physical and mental skills as he methodically takes out his victims one by one sometimes in bunches and thinks his way out of danger as much as he brutes himself outbourne hitches ride with marie well played by the alluring franka potente who is in a bind herself because of inability to get a student visa to get into the us initially she helps bourne for money but eventually you guessed it she falls for bourne and vice versa she also seems to be thrilled by the excitement of it all so she tries to help him figure out who he is meanwhile conklin puts out contracts all around the world to hit bourne as he cant very well have a secret cia operative running around with all of treadstones dirty secrets the most memorable assassin out to get bourne is played by clive owen and he and bourne have an exchange that is one of the best scenes in the film the irony is that conklin doesnt know bourne is an amnesiac so he is really out to get a man with no memory of treadstone or its operations bourne just wants to start fresh and be freeis a very fastpaced exciting film i find it much better than any james bond film it is a surprisingly simple story told with great flair imagination and humanity as stated before damon is excellent in the role and does brilliant job carrying this film the supporting cast is very good as well and the action is crisp lean and mean its really a good oldfashioned action movie that everyone can appreciate modern and oldschool audiences alike because todays advanced technology factors into the film internet surveillance weaponry yet it is infused with a real humanity that makes you care about the central character and his predicament and wonder how hes going to get himself out of it great film,intelligence
i was really excited to hear one of my favorite books was being made into a film  i was surprised at the beginning whenn they didnt say based on the book after watching it i can see why  the only thing it has in common with the book are the characters and some of the first 5 minutes  the plot is completely different  the book is exciting because jason bourne damon is up against the deadliest assasin of all time carlos the jackal and his origins are a mystery until the very end  carlos is nowhere in this film and the secrets of the organization bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 minsanother thing that i havent seen in over a decade is a very anticlimatic ending no real final showdown with the bad guy no incredible revelations just an action scene thats less exciting than the first fight bourne hasas a standalone film its entertaining  as a book adaptation its horrible,intelligence
its hard to believe that back in 2002 would rewrite the rule book for actionspy movies and set a new benchmark theres plenty of thrilling action sequences and theres also the addition of brains to counterbalance the brawn matt damon who was an unlikely choice as the spy jason bourne completely redefined the movie spy for the millennium and made himself and his character a household name based on the best selling novel of the same name by robert ludlum was one of the most successful movies of 2002 which spawned several successful sequelsthe movie begins with jason bourne matt damon good will hunting being rescued by italian fishermen after being found in the middle of the mediterranean sea with two gunshots in his back while being nursed back to full health bourne wakes up with no memory of who he is and how he was found but is fluent in several languages and highly proficient in unarmed combat finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages the only lead bourne can act on is a tiny laser projector under his hip which gives a number of a safe deposit box in zurich after he visits the bank in zurich he finds a large sum of money various passports and a handgun the visit to the bank alerts black ops cia director alexander conklin chris cooper adaptation who is in charge of operation treadstone as conklin and deputy director ward abbott brian cox manhunter spearhead the operation to take down bourne who is believed to have gone rogue bourne enlists the help of german woman marie kreutz franka potente run lola run to initially drive him to paris with a sum of money but finds herself being caught up in the middle of the secretive plot while bourne slowly uncovers how he found himself in his current situation and who he really is he also uncovers the conspiracy to see through that he is not to be taken alivematt damon won critical acclaim for he previous roles in good will hunting 1997 and saving private ryan 1998 here in his career kicks into another gear as super spy jason bourne who also has cemented a well deserved spot as one of the greatest characters amongst such names as james bond rambo terminator and john mcclane to name a few its hard to believe matt damon was an unlikely casting choice but now jason bourne is one of matt damons best rolesthe rest of the supporting cast round out the movie well such as franka potente chris cooper brian cox clive owen julia stiles another unlikely casting choice and adewale akinnuoyeagbaje keep an eye out for walton goggins the shield gabriel mann revenge and josh hamilton american horror storydirector doug liman was also an unlikely choice as director following his work in indie movies such as swingers 1996 and go 1999 but here his work has worked wondersspawned several blockbusting sequels however giving credit where its due was the movie that started it all and made its permanent mark putting a lot of no brainer action movies to shame is more of a thinking mans action movie with spectacular stunts and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride even after mobys extreme ways plays during the end credits you still find yourself glued to your seat is still an entertaining action movie from start to finish910,intelligence
the first in the successful bourne franchise set the bar higher for future entries it has to be said matt damon reinvented himself here as an action hero in the form of the title character the first sight of whom we get is floating face down in a dark stormy sea hes not dead of course and recovers remarkably quickly from being shot so many times in the back but once he does he methodically works his way back to filling in his amnesiac memory as he finds out hes a brokendown killing machine whos now a liability to his employersalong the way inevitably of course he joins forces with a girl theres always a girl of the feisty and rootless type naturally who although only taking bourne on initially as the most expensive taxihire in history naturally develops feelings for him even as all hell seems to break loose around him from there to the end the race is on for bourne to get his memory and identity back before the badgood guys get him considering the number of sequels spawned to date you can guess our guy doesnt exactly lose although rather the same cant be said of some of his most ardent pursuerswhat immediately set bourne apart from other spyactionhero types is that there are no gimmicks about him the way that he comes across as an ordinaryaverage sort of guy until you press his buttons gets us on his side from the very start our faith in him to come through as a goodguy in the end vindicated by the humanity he shows in his first wouldbe assassination mission more than that the fastcut action sequences are quite superb especially the expertly choreographed fightscenes the movie never slackens as it moves as relentlessly forward much like our heros own mission to find himselfdamon is terrific in the title part and dominates the film the direction keeps the tension going right to the end interspersing the dynamic stylised action sequences with just enough charactersetting to fill in the backgrounds without slowing the film to a halteven better was to come in the series but this excellent opener is more than just a curtainsup on one of recent cinemas best characters its an excellent espionage thriller in its own right,intelligence
okay so i decided to watch this because i looked at it and thought it may appeal to me so i decided to sit down and watch what people consider to be the great spy movies of this generation i guess you can call james bond the greatest in the 20th century and i thought it was a very worthwhile watchso a the movie begins with fishermen finding a man in the water with 2 bullets in his back and a device in his hip that says a bank account that he owns when he wakes up he has no memory of who he is and tries to uncover his past but somehow not forgetting the skills he had im no amnesia expert so i dont know if thats how it works or not but he finds out soon thereafter that a lot of people want to kill or apprehend him and when that happens who knows whatll happen next so he has to uncover the mystery of who he is while running with someone that just happened to get in the way all across europebasically i think if there are any complaints there are two one of them is that bourne is a lot like a modern james bond in the sense that he has some kind of super brain that can process all the number plates outside a gas station who owns each car and all this other kind of stuff of which i think to an extent kind of hurts the realistic spy action they were going for i mean the whole he can dodge 50 bullets fired at him in the same second kind of goes with the genre but this nothe other thing i didnt like is the action itself probably the only time it felt tense is at the beginning of one of the first fights in the movie where that guy jumps through the window although id call that more startling and although shaky cam and fast editing in action scenes are the norm and believe me when i say this movie does do things better namely i can tell whats going on but i just feel no tension or weight to it that maybe just me thoughaside from that there really isnt that much to complain about i didnt feel like how bourne got out of the situations warranted a facepalm like other action movies made recently and although i said there isnt that much weight or tension to the action there kind of is to almost everything else and a little bit of character development shines through in places theres also the cinematography and some of the actingso if what youre looking for is a semirealistic spy thriller where it manages to probably be one of the better action movies of the last 15 years then i would recommend this movie i will watch its sequels maybe even the one starring jeremy renner and maybe if i like them the future movies in this series and possibly the books so if this sounds like your thing then go see it if you havent already,intelligence
this review for latecomers to the movie most likely younger viewers who consider anything prior to 2010 to be dark ages wrong within its niche loosely actionspyamnesia it may end up being one of the greatest ever watchable and entertaining over and overi think i have seen this more than 10 times putting it up there with fistful of dollars and godfather the pedigree is astonishing ludlum was not respected in his lifetime but he sure sold a lot of books interestingly bourne had already emerged as the most popular of his works long before the film adaption was attempted while not breakthrough  amnesia stories have been done to death especially in the 1940s  the combination of the memory issue and the assassin twist essentially put the story over the top there were written sequels rare for ludlum and posthumous attempts to revive the character in new novels very rarethis 2002 film was serendipity gilroy a veteran did one of the leanest adaptations ever his writing is genius the film moves through progressive action arcs so eloquently the viewer does not even realize what is happening consider the arc where the bourne character takes out clive owens counterassassin its almost brusque on the news that the dog is not responding bourne goes into action like a tiny terminator not a second of screen time is wasted how many films can make the same claim damon is an excellent actor but the argument can be made that he did too good a job with bourne hence his refusal to appear in the last film arguably he was too young for the part as written but props to director liman for going with him anyway that decision made film historythe supporting cast is brilliant cooper and cox as supporting characters r u kidding me wowthe criticism can be made not by me but it can be made that potente does not inject enough feminine energy she mainly reacts never acts which probably explains the overemphasis on the pam landy character in the two sequels which works well but the truth is this is a mans action film and one of the best ever so the director had latitudeand poor clive owen in of the great ironies of cinema his action scene became a metaphor for his alist career at the time the common wisdom was that he was the next big thing didnt happenhighly recommended the sequel is serviceable but not a standout the final part of the trilogy is satisfying but lacks magic any future films without damon are to be scrupulously avoided,intelligence
2002its a slightly ludicrous plot and not a very complex one but its so well done so fast and well acted it just takes off and never stops and works great you couldnt ask for a better action adventure espionage film without depth not only is matt damon well cast and doing his best but his lesser known female unwitting but not at all witless companion is terrific too and thats franke potente forever known best for run lola runthe fighting in slightly fast motion to give a comic book feel to it all even more than a martial arts style and the cia backroom stuff where they have to kill their own agent to protect their image on capitol hill is all good enough for any movie but for me the thing that lifts this just a bit higher is the relationship between the damon and potente characters the actors play it all very cool show normal fear and confusion and really demonstrate a deep trust in each other by the ending you are so happy for them you might be sad to hear there are two sequelsdirector doug liman seems to come out of nowhere for such a complex and well directed film though his two earlier features swinger and go are both very strong its interesting that both the sequels received similarly rave reviews among the mainstream press and both were directed by someone else paul greengrass which might point to the strength of the underlying story and cast on the other hand liman set the tone and style of the following two films and there is something superior about having done it first this is a good film and a great film of its typethe photography and effects are talked about here and director of photography oliver wood shoots all three films which shouldnt be overlooked since these are such visceral visual experiences guaranteed to not let you doze off good fun,intelligence
thanks to bourne bond was given that update makeover that was needed although a loose adaptation of robert ludlum novel its a far superior to closer rework 1988 tv movie starring richard chamberlain and angel jaclyn smithmatt damons does a surprisingly great job not just as jason bourne the character but against type cast convincing the viewer that hes a dangerous and physical spy while is action packed with some fantastic fight choreography and car chases it feels realistically grounded as an effective espionage thriller the captivating screenplay by tony gilroy and w blake herron gives the cast time to shine franka potente brian cox and chris cooper are all on fine form and theres also a small memorable role by clive owen as an assassinthe film has a great look and benefits from the real life european locations doug limans direction is exceptional utilising a hand held style that has become common place in mainstream films since the score is exciting and mobys theme tune is captivating for such a high concept film bourne identity is very convincing it avoids clichs has some twists and exudes atmosphereis must see,intelligence
is an actionpacked adaptation of renowned author robert ludlums international bestseller of the same name and it sure as hell isnt your average leaveyourbrains behind thriller which is sadly what many of the james bond films had become the plot is the primary focus of this film which the mindnumbing action scenes gloss and glamour taking only secondary precedence the film begins with the unconscious body of a man matt damon with two bullets in his back being hauled out of the mediterranean sea on a stormy night by the crew members of a fishing boat when the unknown man regains consciousness he realizes he has no memory of who he is or how he ended up in this predicament the only clues to his past are a swiss bank account number embedded in his hip and an indepth knowledge of various european languages the man embarks on a journey to discover his true identity but the more he leanrs the more questions arise who is jason bourne how did he become a living breathing fighting machine why is he being hunted at every turn by the authorities and a mysterious group of assassins jason must use every skill he has acquired in an unremembered life to survive answer these questions and uncover the secrets behind the film is in no way an accurate adaptation of the ludlum novel eliminating much of the novels complex multilayered plot and backstory nevertheless it remains fairly true to the spirit of the novel as far as the protagonist his motives and character are concerned is a character based drama unlike the book its a story of people adapting to nearimpossible circumstances rather than about uncovering conspiracies and schemes damons brilliant performance as bourne is supplemented by an excellent supporting cast of franke potente as marie kreutz the films female lead chris cooper as conklin a cia black ops strategist brian cox as ward abbott a highranking cia official and clive owen in a minor but fairly significant role as the silent killer known as the professor all in all a truly unforgettable film,intelligence
jason bourne is not james bond the name bears a remarkable similarity as does the world the superagent inhabits but the parallels end there bond investigates and spies for his government he possesses alluring charm perfect confidence detailed knowledge of his enemies premeditated plans and an ability to murder anybody without warning james bond seeks violence violence seeks bourne bourne has no desire to take others lives but wherever he hides the bloodshed finds him when it does he has no choice but to use his lethal skills i dont even know who im running from he laments he must devise his next moves quickly he is not charismatic and he has no swagger the two jbs are completely different but the brains and brawn behind prove both styles can succeeda fishing vessel off the coast of france rescues jason bourne matt damon unconscious and floating face up he has been shot twice and has a laser pointer imbedded in his hip when he awakes his biographical memory is gone the pointer provides the only clue to his identityan account number to a bank deposit box in zurich he uses extremely advanced martial arts to escape intense situations and what amazing skills they are he strikes with a superhuman combination of strength precision and awareness he seems to have eyes in the back of his head his environmental perception reaches extraordinary levels but he cannot understand why nor the reason somebody tries to kill him in parisa mysterious branch of the cia does know its leader alexander conklin chris cooper fears the implications of bourne being alive and causing commotion from his basement warroom he directs a team assigned to track bourne and put him in a body bag after marie franka potente drives jason to paris conklin adds her to the hit list for his specialized assassins clive owen nicky naudefew action movies work well without a powerful villain physically chris cooper is the perfect choice for conklin his perfectly slicked hair bass voice and face which looks like the faade to a vault of experience make the perfect image of a forceful leader cooper communicates a lot of information with his mannerisms mostly while issuing orders with fire in his speechthe great part is that we dont just see him give the orders we hear them explained we hear responses from team members we see the field agents receive their messages and prepare for action liman keeps us in the room when he hear his underlings report what they have discovered and how we see him update his superior brian cox and discuss with him the next course of action these scenes add a special flavor to the filmthe action appears at an unusual pace mostly during the first hour the best are the fistfight in paris and a car chase that soon follows liman follows the top rule for filming action do not try to manufacture tension with rapid fire cuts or fancy camera work let the quality of the production speak for itself just find a quality angle to let it speak it is sad that paul greengrass broke it for the two sequels only alex proyas has permission to thatwhat is on screen is indeed high quality it also reveals another difference between bond and bourne evasion is always his first option while being chased inside a building bourne throws away the gun he takes the third time in the movie he does that even in the climax he only kills the guards because he has no choice but fighting them acting wise damon plays bourne straightforward nothing fancy here damon is understated the correct approach for a character of that personality yet he remembers that even a hunted man can smilepotente is an attractive woman but that is not the point here maries function is companionship and transportation for bourne she is more than a sex partner in fact bourne chooses to sleep on the floor when they share a room potente also remains toned down brian cox and gabriel mann playing conklins top assistant both bring what their roles need cox has his best moment when he tells conklin you never made a mistake before most impressive among the supporting cast is clive owen who speaks volumes with his silencefrom russia with love is probably the only bond movie structured like both are heavily plot and subterfuge focused the payoff is far better in the former but bourne excels more in its slow areas by keeping a close eye on the details liman assures that no moment is boring there are no bondlike gadgets since bourne has no q to make them he uses standard equipment in innovative ways that is only one of the reasons why wins in all categories,intelligence
this is a fabulous movie an example of what hollywood can do  now and then  to keep us interested there is no point me summarising the plot as its a well known movie and the review does not need thatthis is an action thriller of an understated variety the character development is natural and the plot points unfold in an uncontrived fashion this engenders a much more riveting engagement that the ott xxx approach when action sequences occur they are filmed in a stark and realistic manner and they are all the more exciting for thisfocussing on a few key characters enables us to build a relationship with those people a relationship that really does make us care for them and their outcomes they are not mere stooges in a nonstop cavalcade of explosions and an anteupping pissing contest between special fx bodsthe location shooting is superb using the weather to great effect and really fostering a feel for those cities and their inhabitantsi am a latecomer to this series but am very much looking forward to viewing the other two filmsben,intelligence
is a historically important film for the popular spy thriller genre the story is character driven and this is what gives it the edge it needs the action and fight scenes are not gratuitous which you see in too many films in this genre and the action is realistic which adds to the plot rather than subtracting from itunlike many of the bond films especially the moore and brosnan movies the movie grasps the feel of what audiences yearn for in a spy thriller it is realistic and gritty without being so complex that it would be difficult for the layperson who never experienced being a secret agent to understandi must admit that i absolutely love the spy thrillers they are my favorite genre of film i would have to rank ronin from russia with love and casino royale the best of the genre all of these movies really capture the essence of what secret agents should be in film they are gritty packed with timely action and are realisticwhat sets bourne aside from the others is the unique story of a man who finds himself lost with amnesia and running from the people who trained him he is not on a mission for his government but instead is running for his own lifematt damons acting is superb and there is a great supporting cast notably franka potente and chris cooper the soundtrack is perfect as is the cinematography both capture the absolute correct moodwhether you are a fan or not of the spy thriller you may still like this movie because it is a great story with great characters rating 10 of 10,intelligence
if you keep pursuing me i will bring this fight to your door i remember that line from the character jason bourne like it was yesterday this was a tense and taught thriller with a solid connecting hit wow from the professional music score that rivets you into your seat and then the clash of action that comes down around you from gun fire to selfdefensive technique that is exacting and bone breaking jason is a trained professional in everything he does he is skilled in recon he is a tactician he is a warrior that is trained and molded to win to make good wherever he is and whatever the assignment may be until the little child that he saw on the yacht that one night that he was sent to take out wombosic he screwed up and it nearly cost him his life now with marie traveling with him things are about to changeagainbut now its changed and he is on the move with a team tracking his moves lead by ward abbott brian cox he is starting to feel someone on his path just behind him yet he is able to maneuver out of the way and give himself enough time to setup camp and wait for their arrival the best example being the professor he took him down in the wide open space of a field with a lot of cover grass then that chase scene with jason driving into oncoming traffic was edgy and a perfect get away its his war and he will bring it all out to them matt damon is on it all the wayi recommend for people who love a fantastic and enthralling action plot in a film with a superb cast ,intelligence
ive seen this movie on the shelves for a while i was planning to watch it one day you know when circumstances would bring it on my path no its true i didnt care much about it for obvious reasons first this movie didnt seemed very popular and nobody ever told me anything about it but second matt damon in the lead role left me somehow perplex probably due to his lack of charismawhatsoever now in early 2007 i took the time to enjoy this finally excellent production on the whole the movie shines by its precise realization its well balanced way to tell the story to establish characters relations and successions of events amazingly especially for this kind of moviethrilleractionstealth almost nothing is exaggerated or at least unrealistic and oversaturated to the extreme like the usual made in usa productions the pace is just right and leave us exactly the right time to taste and enjoy every details without relieving the needed tension so on the directing side this jewel is just wonderful the cast is another strong point it gave me another look to its main actor matt damon by showing his physical ability and by using his kind of average charisma as i said to enhance the natural behavior of his character chris cooper to my opinion is always welcome maybe not his most memorable performance ever but still excellent enigmatic clive owen was a good surprise to me few dialog for him but he astonishingly fits as an invisible sniper hitman i wouldnt ever have thought so the haircuts and clothes were maybe discrete but perfectly chosen franka potente was enjoyable too its the first time ive seen her on screen thoughsadly ive watched a 43 full screen version of the film so i cant fairly comment the photography but it seems to follow the whole thing being homogeneous and just right the sound was especially well mixed and didnt seemed to use typical audio fx samples for details like gunshots silenced gunshots or engines and it feels even more realistic that way lovely use of the surround sound even in calm or quiet momentsclean and brief but effective fighting scenes are something we cant miss the only car pursuit was delicious sharp dynamic and spectacular but still sober and realistic hard to believe isnt it the european settings were perfect and refreshing overall even funny for the pursuitobviously this movie was a great surprise and to my opinion stands above most bigger productions of the same genre sober and humble impeccable i hardly cant find anything wrong about it honestly three thumbs ups,intelligence
i was pleasantly surprised that a big budget hollywood action film was character driven the casting of mat damon was was inspired he brings a vulnerability to a character who could have been played in a stereotypical way from a lesser actor  not only did he bring a subtle angst to his portrayal he showed an amazing ability to portray the physical requirements of jason bournes characterthe script had minimal flaws which in lesser films can detract from the ability of the viewer to engage in escapism the director kept the action flowing and didnt dumb down scenes with obvious setups which can bring an audience back to reality,intelligence

this movie has become my favorite spyassassin movie of all time  the first time i saw it i thought it was very good but not great  wrong  this movie kicks so much a its ridiculous  i think you just have to watch it a few times before it sinks in  the acting was great car chases were killer plenty of shooting to keep you entertained and a cool storyline to follow and keep you in suspense  matt damon is jason bourne rescued by greek fishermen 30 miles off the coast of france with two bullets imbedded in his back he has no memory of his life or what happened to him  he soon discovers when he reaches land that a secret us government agency called treadstone knows he is alive and is trying to eliminate him  he must elude his pursuers across europe and discover his identity with the help of a woman he hardly knows franka potente before it is too late and they kill him and her  based on the best selling novel by the late robert ludlum i have heard that the writers took some liberties when they created the screenplay but since when is that bad thing when you do a good job  the casting was excellent and the locations fantastic one of the higher points often touched upon in other reviews  chris cooper and brian cox are poster boys for bureaucrats gone bad and julia stiles does well in her limited role  clive owen is devilish as the professor one of the hitmen assigned to kill jason bourne  i never would have considered matt damon of all people as a legitimate action star but he sure can surprise you time and time again  he has definitely eclipsed buddy ben affleck in terms of box office draw and acting  this one put him on the map as a leading man and sensational new star  engrossing from start to finish  followed by the sequel the bourne supremacy,intelligence
for starters let me say that i have partially read the novel that this movie is based on published in the 1980s and found it a sometimes tough boring slog the only reason i picked it up to begin with is because i saw the tv movie in 1988 with richard chamberlain it was the beginning of my understanding that books and movies by their very natures are completely different animals as for this version of well i wasnt expecting much though i was intrigued by certain ivorytower critics who gave this film a second look when it hit dvd and decided that maybe it wasnt so bad if i was moderately entertained id have called it a success but i was suprisedfor all its occassional hitech trappings this film reminded me more than anything of 1975s three days of the condor with robert redford and max von sydow anyone who liked needs to see it immediately if they havent already its geared to entertaining the over18 crowd as opposed to the usual adolescent thrillseekers most modern action films pander to theres gunplay but nothing so overblown as ten thousand bullets for one shootout the catandmouse game outside the farmhouse comes to mind theres martialarts a lesserknown style called kali but no wirefu for once and lest we forget theres one of the best carchase sequences in recent memory through paris whod have thunk that a yugo could make such a good getaway vehiclebut these are general elements specific details that brought back condor memories are as followsmatt damon as jason bourne like redfords lowlevel researcher he plays a man stuck in a situation that he has no idea how he got into and even less of an idea of whos aiming the bullets at him but its not quite oneforone redford didnt have anything to fall back on aside from his experience in the army and ma bell his ignorance is based on his rank in the cia hiearchy bourne on the other hand speaks multiple languages has formidible fighting skills and is one of the brightest tacticians ive ever seen on the silver screen but he has absolutely no clue as to how he is able to do what he does its all just instinct and reaction the frustrating conundrum for him a fact that is made very clear in the initial sequences when his skills come into play is that in spite of these advantages the unknown past may have already doomed his futurefranka potente as marie kruetz potentes role is more of a bohemian version of faye dunaways character in condor than anything else but again there are key differences redford forced dunaway to cooperate at gunpoint only coming over to his side with great reluctance kruetz is made of sterner stuff as one would expect from a lifetime on the road bourne uses that other great persuader money to get what he needs from kruetz and actually gives her the option of getting out while the getting is still good their eventual sleeping together even feels a bit less forced than the similar setup in condor a particularly novel touch about the inevitable morning after scene is the fact that bourne is already up dressed and has wiped every surface in the room the relationship is really the heart of the movie without it most of the story is just not thereclive owen as the professor while im a trifle disappointed that owen didnt get more to do with this role unlike most folks who discovered his obvious talent in croupier i first saw him prove his acting chops in the video clips for the old adventure game privateer 2 the darkening his smoky grey presence brings to mind max von sydows cultured assasin in condoreven the professor moniker seems to hint at such a connection like bourne hes a killing machine as impersonal and scary as a fully loaded ak47 to the head the scene where he pops into pick up his info from julia stiles illustrates this beautifully the only real difference between him and bourne is the fact that he knows the answers to the questions bourne has been asking that he doesnt mind answering them after being bested calls to mind von sydows killing of redfords quarry and then politely suggesting an extended vacation in europe when they both walk outside a baddie who isnt really a baddiewhat a concept huhwithout giving too much away i thought that the final twist on what put bourne out in the middle of the mediterranean to be both logical and even believable given everything that came before this would seem to suggest the influence of john woo but only in the arena of character development something particularly stressed in the killer and the a better tomorrow films its basic plot logic set up the story in such a way that when the final suprise twist comes through it doesnt feel like a deus ex machina so much as a reasonable conclusioni honestly hope that this film is the start of a trend in the action genre just because most action movies are the cinematic equivalent of junk food doesnt mean they have to be whats wrong with a little fillet mignon,intelligence
matt damon comes off well as the celebrated jason bourne and franka potente is marvelous as marie while loosely based on the character created by robert ludlum the film keeps you drilled to the screen as it moves quickly from one scene to the next brian cox and chris cooper are superb character actors and a fine addition to the film as the two cia operatives in charge of treadstone julia stiles is particularly good in the role as nicki the operative who coordinates the assets excellent performances throughout the film are what makes this story so believable or is it the fact we as americans think our government is capable of doing this language and violence are the reasons for the r rating so they little ones need to be away from the screen when you are watching for the grownups this is an entertaining action film with lots of wow moments that led hollywood to make two more,intelligence
i give a strong 8 out of 10 its pretty good i have not read the books im not a big book reader anyway the movie has enough to keep you interested it has a good character that is jason bourne matt damon plays him well he is very believable as jason bourne you can really care for the main character he has no idea who he is what his name is or anything until he starts to beat people up he thinks there is something very suspicious about himself he was an assassin thats cool he was a killing machine that knows a lot about how to work with guns he knows some good fighting moves but he wants to know how he knows how to do all these things and who he was and who he worked for the movie is something you can really identify with and i really liked all the stuff between franka potente and matt damon pretty good chemistry and the movie is a good journey and adventure you keep learning the more it goes a lot of the action scenes were pretty cool im not much for the car chase but i like all the other action scenes the fight with the assassin in the hotel room the scene on the stairwell at the end of the movie the scene between clive owen and matt damon i like the embassy scene when matt damon climbs down the wall and the fights and stuff are pretty brutal and jason bourne uses anything for his disposal i like how a lot of bad guys are after bourne there is a lot to keep you interested and entertained there may be a few weaknesses maybe some of it kind of takes up time i guess there are some parts that dont seem to be needed or that are not really important a good action movie with a main character to care a lot for,intelligence

i figured this was a cant miss movie doug liman is a great director and it seemed like the cast was pretty strong however what a standard paint by the numbers average at best spy thriller do we really have to wait two hours for the happy ending that we all know is coming in the end the scenes of europe were nice but hardly enough added to the problems of this movie is the fact that matt damon is just not that strong of actor he seems to be void of any real charisma the guy is plastic and unless you are a 14 year old girl not worthy of your time in this movie we get to see him kind of interact with a romantic interest however it is tacked on and less than steamy talk about going through the motions the bad guys have no redeeming qualities the good guy is a saint yata yata what shocked me was why this movie was getting such high marks it was ronin without the action once again mediocrity is praised as good and good is praised as great well this movie was not great or even that good sadly lacking,intelligence
i cannot believe what has been made out of arguably ludlums finest not a shred has been left of the original suspensefilled story its unbelievable someone adapted a script from the book this badly robert must have turned in his grave at the premiere im sure hed never allowed this atrocity to happenthe film is just not compelling not gripping anywhere the audience never gets involved which is a very sad outcome for such a promising plot unfortunately the plots been mangled to a fraction of what could have been should have been i mean even the main antagonist from the book the absolute bad guy the other pivotal character next to bourne his nemesis the one who makes bourne what he is is blatantly omitted from the movie absolutely incredible a pure disgrace if you ask me its like deleting sauron from the lord of the rings trilogy or cutting darth vader from star wars believe me its that bad at best 10 is left of the original storyapart from some somewhat entertaining actionsequences that never get your blood boiling because youre never emotionally attached to the main characters its like watching a documentary in fast forward not that the acting of damon or lola potente is that bad it just seems that every other character was brought in from amateurnight and the script is even worse the whole production just screams out rushjob as ive read the book 6 times i came in to see this film with great expectations alas the movie shockingly bored the hell out of me utter disappointment and a total ripoffone advice read the phenomenal book cycle forget the awful movie theyre in no way related,intelligence
whoever wrote the review on the home page of this movie must be related to the director or matt damon he was wooden most of the time and his range of emotion is from ab and the blatant errors by the director were numerous why oh why would bourne continue to carry around that bloody red bank bag when he was on the run love car chasesyou will get your moneys worth here the beginning scenes were so dark and confusing that it did not set the stage for what was to come compare this to any bond movie and i mean any all the way back is a disgrace and ridiculous as an avid reader this belittles the ludlum book to me the only enjoyment was seeing a favorite actor clive owen even in this small and insignificant role had he been the bourne character i know the movie could have been better,intelligence
after reading robert ludlums excellent book i was filled with anticipation before watching this movie especially since matt damon is a very talented guy so what went wrong  the movie misses most of the plot from the book and doesnt manage to come up with one on its own so it ends up a mediocre action movie with no plot but some nice fight scenes that sums it all up for me for those of you who have read the books think of what this movie could have been and weep,intelligence
where is carlos this movie is nothing like the new york times bestselling book i read this movie is so far from the novel first of all main characters are missing second of all the plot is so different and third of all events that made jason bourne the assassin are not there this is not even a quarter as good as the movie is trust me if you think the movie was good read the novel and you will be amazed and if you havent watched it yet dont it will ruin the great novel for you this is a must read novel but definitely a must throw out movie take this advice from a jason bourne die hard fan you should read the novelits a bestseller for a reason the only reason i watched the movie was because i thought it was like the novel but its not it is far from it the novel will suck you in the first part might be a little boring but it only goes uphill from there this is a book you will not be able to put downthe late robert ludlum is the greatest author of all time and his character jason bourne proves me right and carlos is missing jason bournes biggest enemy and rival and reason for him being an assassin is nowhere to be found he is not in the story and on top of that his wife dies in the second what is that robert ludlum and jason bourne fans should be disappointed,intelligence
i found this version of markedly inferior to the 1988 tv version with richard chamberlain the latest bourne did not follow the book very closely and often left the viewerme wondering how anyone could at all perceive the logic of the plotand i found matt damon totally unconvincing as jason bourne who is supposed to be a man of sophistication and maturity compare the much more accurate 1988 bourne and chamberlain an actor far more suitable to the role,intelligence
so whats the film about well its about this guy who is a secret agent and he loses his memory so how are you going to establish his character and make people identify with him well have matt damon play him oh good well we wont worry about making him an actualy character thenand this sums up one of two major problems with this film one is that it is totally about it being matt damon jason bourne is not an individual he is matt damon now i dont have a probably with damon i think he can be a fine actor but there was no discernable writing in regards to his character i was left feeling more for one of the assasians who is sent after him and was only in the film for 5 minutes than i was for the two main characters it meant that one got to the end of the film and asked why followed by who cares the second problem was that the director seemed to be going for an old fashioned 70s spy film feel the kind were lots of talking happens and then there is a 5 second fight scene and we then cut back to exotic locales and lots of talking with exotic women and tough men except the director had no idea of how to achieve this so the film just dragged on interminably leaving the viewer wondering when something was actually going to happen it never did 1 out of 10 thouroughly average,intelligence
this movie bored me to tears hideous miscasting julia stiles what were you thinking the people you want to see more of are given bit parts brian cox clive owen and the wrong people die no explaination of jasons existance is given and the only bit of directorial style is the opening sequence and after that all is downhill its no more than an excuse for matt to be an action hero and attempt to convince us he can act by having some lines in foreign languages utterly without redeeming features,intelligence
there are only the most tenuous of connections between the plot of this movie and the book by robert ludlum on which it claims to be based bourne mightnt be the only whos suffering memory problemsmatt damon is earnest franka potente is confused and clive owens is a welcome addition  the story is less tense yet more surprising than the book perhaps as a result of us being allowed to see much less of whats happening inside the characters heads especially bournesso this isnt an update of  its not a retelling its a new story based on a one line description of the booki wonder if ludlum got to read the treatment before he died,intelligence
well six months of waiting for what i believed to be a very promising launchpadofanovel has exploded in a very distraught engineers face robert ludlums characters storyline  even the premise  are nowhere to be found in doug limans big screen adaptation  all i can surmise is that the screenwriter tony gilroy wrote a movie completely unrelated to ludlums masterpiece then changed the names and faces of those involved to besmirch the innocentgone is david webb from bournes pysche and all the delicious inner turmoil  cain is relegated to a mere name on a passport  gone is the brilliant and wonderful canadian economist marie st jacques  gone is the dynamic and repentant psychiatrist mo panov  and most notably gone is the master assassin himself  the inimitable carlos the jackalso whats left  a mediocre action flick about a bad guy with no memory and no direction  a screenplay so ambiguous and bland that it could easily be mistaken for a wayward james bond movie  lite  james bond lite  only one caloriei am ashamed for you mr liman mr gilroy  and i fear for the day that i will need to squeeze my eyes shut to avoid any glimpse of the sequeljw,intelligence
i have just finished watching this movie and felt i have wasted 2 hoursthey tog the best book ever been written ludlums bourne identity a book that has this great plot and suspense that made it impossible to let go and i cant believe that they altered the story and turned it into an low sized average transparent junk spy flickthe tv version is a lot better than this crab dont see the movie,intelligence
the one big problem with this movie the scriptwriter never read the book evidence you ask for simple the movie has nothing whatsoever to do with ludlums bookwhich was geniusbeyond the name of the main character where was carlos and his insidious farreaching organization where was dr washburn and ile de port noir what the hell is bourne doing sleeping on a park bench where the hell did that dictator come from marie greutz anyone with a passing knowledge of the book knows bournes lady love is marie st jacques an economist working for the canadian government and what the hell did they do to treadstone and the monkthis is bourne in name only and deserves none of the praise it is inexplicably receiving the awful animated lord of the rings was more faithful to source material than this monstrosity,intelligence
what a filthy stupid little movie matt damon provides a nice action role but the rest of the film is utterly pitiful imagine the writerdirector somehow getting it into his head that he could improve on ludlums novel my god what was he thinking this movie is so simplistic and so dumb that i could feel my iq getting lower and lower as i was watching it how could you possibly take ludlums complex and intricate storylines and turn it into a movie about a guy running around paris dodging dumb french cops thats an oxymoron isnt it and shooting dumb french people oy vey where is carlos the jackal where is the intricate web of deceit stupid stupid stupid its a good thing ludlum is dead or he might have a stroke after seeing thisthing,intelligence
this is one of the most hyped up pieces of junk ive ever seen i really dont understand what made people like this movie so much everything in the movie was extremely predictable with no twists in the movie at all i found the movie extremely pointless to watch i would only recommend it to someone who cant normally predict whats going to happen in the movie so it can make them feel better about themselves,intelligence
is superb movie with great action and suspense matt damon is really a action hero in this film and in my opinion he could be a new action starfranka potente was very good and she is a promising actress if she is the good roles chris cooper was very good brian cox was very good and he looked different than he did in earlier films adewale akinnuoyeagbaje was good but the role he was given didnt allow him to do much but he is becoming one of my favorite actors tbi is a very good film with some great action scenes that i never saw beforeif you like matt damon and spy films then go rent ,intelligence
this movie was made simply to get people in the movie theaters to see matt damon and things blow up  whats worse it has no redeeming qualities  the acting is atrocious everything about it reminded me of either spy game or the matrix  the whole idea of damon not knowing who he is and yet sensing everything thats going to happen is pretty nonsensical  dont look too deep in this movie youll get nothing  just be a passive sponge and wait for the box office to instill in you what a good movie is  and if you agree with me go watch spy game it at least has some fairly good acting,intelligence
doug liman is a fine director of thrillers as demonstrated here this is one of the fastest action films in a while the story is somewhat muddy with all the turns and twists some readers at imdb have compared it to spy games which pales in comparison to this film that other film had two actors that are an enigma brad pitt and robert redford gives us another wooden actor matt damon who is the best example of a bad actor with the right connections hes always in the right place at the right time mr damon keeps turning up like a bad penny in hollywood films when there are better actors who are having a hard time paying their billstake the case of the character actors of this film chris cooper clive owens and brian cox to name only 3 they dont have anything to do here it is a shame they are hired to be in the background of a nonactori wonder if anyone that saw this film could explain to me how is it that what the main character goes thru and doesnt even get a scratch to his face i guess the studio executives expect us to grin and bear it and justify what we see as a fantastic agent who is superhumanin the love sequences there are no chemistry between ms potente and damon run marie run from this sucker make better adult oriented films in germany or wherever but never pair against mr damon againsorry mr liman better luck next time and better actors too you certainly know the business of entertaining an audience,intelligence
in my opinion is the best out of the entire trilogy jason bourne is really cute in this movie and hes less angry or in his i need to kill anyone who follows me mode i love this movie to death it is my second favorite bourne film in the trilogy the first one will be the bourne supremacy the movie is the second adaptation of the robert ludlum novel of the same name the first being a 1988 television film starring richard chamberlain as bourne this is a mystery spy thriller that you keep guessing what happened with jason and it is so intense matt damon does a powerful performance and incredible job as jason bourne this movie is packed with curiosity romance and of course action it is not boring or over long and most the time it feels like the film is more realistic this is the real jason bourne and not the character matt damon was portraying today in the fifth installment jason bourne 2016 i hate that movie but i love this one plot a man is picked up by a fishing boat bulletriddled and suffering from amnesia before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory i did hear about this movie in 2002 or 2003 i always wanted to watch this movie after reading an article in the magazine about this film 10 years ago when i was in high school i watched this movie on tv and i loved it i turn on my computer and i went to see if there is any sequel and yes it was the bourne supremacy and at the time our network did not give the sequel on tv it took me 3 years till i download and watched the whole trilogy and i love the first two movies to death and i love the character jason bourne he is decent we find out more about treadstone that is assassin squad a topsecret black ops program of the central intelligence agency cia i absolutely love this film to death director doug liman did amazing job producing and directing this movie and he knew exactly what he has to do to make it right and it worked clive owen as the professor the cia hitman was a fantastic assassin and the villain i loved himi love the chemistry between jason and marie kreutz franka potente i love the fight scene between jason and cia assassin castel nicky naud in paris i love how jason becomes a fugitive and he doesnt kill trough entire film anyone except the bad guys on the end of the movie i love the showdown scene with jason bourne matt damon using a 12 gauge double barreled shotgun belonging to eamon tim duttin to search for the professor after the professor tracks him and marie to the farmhouse in the french countryside bourne shoots the professor twice with eamons shotgun mortally wounding him i love that scene to death in this movie julia styles has a lot to do in mostly sequels she was useless but in this movie she was brilliant and the star off the movie she was helping alexander conklin chris cooper cia really hunting bourne she was powerful joy able and intelligent field logistics coordinator and agent handler i love her to death in herebrian cox as ward abbott as head of operations was incredible villain and he was the mastermind behind treadstone operations chris cooper is fantastic as conklin field director of the treadstone he is the fantastic villain franka potente is sexy and really gorgeous likable i love her ascent because she is really german like her character marie isi never read a book or the novel and i have never hear about the movies or the character before but watching this movie i fall in love with it this movie become the hit in summer 2002 who would have thought that good will hunting himself could pull off a kickass balls to the walls secret agent character that would essentially change the way we see action movies for the 21st century matt damon does that very thing is filled with old school action and stunts that makes this film dare i say better then bond ever was of course that changed when casino royale came out however it was jason bourne that started the new look overall this movie is brilliant and intelligent i love this film to death it is my second favorite film in the series love the car chase scenes with bourne and marie siting in it i have fun watching the movie and i will always watch it over and over again it is my favorite spy mystery action film watch this one a few times and youll likely be quite moved each time ill be surprised if you give it less than what i gave it 1010 is a

as i said on my review title that i am new to the bourne series i recently bought the trilogy  loved watching all of the 3 but this is my review for 2002 starting matt damon as jason bourne a trained assassin who has lost his memoryjason doesnt know who he is  who he worked for now all this he have to figure it out on his own along with a girl named marie who dont have money  is traveling how they both figure things out plus there are a lot of bad guys out there to kill them  when i heard about the series i never was interested in watching any of itbut i am happy that i watched it recently  i loved itthis film spawned 2 more sequels overall this film is highly entertaining its got actionsuspense  great storymy rating is 1010 must see,intelligence
perfect spy movie matt damon is great could be improved by a terminator but nevertheless 1010,intelligence
just watched it again and oh boy does it make the sequels look pale and how could anybody sane think that franka potente could be replaced by julia stiles fcs,intelligence
as with most action and other type films now the first of the best that is absolutely true here the jason bourne series of films which is at 5 and counting now is quite good after the 3rd film i thought it was already wearing thin and had closure one thong you can count on is when a studio has a hit they will wear it out and that is proven here when the 4th and 5th versions came out it simply became a game of seeing how many different people can be roped into the same roles i just saw this film again on hbo of course its 17 years old now even though i have seen this at least a dozen times its the 1st time i noticed walton goggins in it who has been cast in a slew of films the past decade i had noticed gabriel mann before in several fims but the 1st time i noticrd goggins was in predators 2010 anyway i still like this film very much it launched a whole genre in my opinion soeaking of multiple films the extreme are the fast  furious films the film series should have stopped long before paul walker was killed in a high speed car wreck the true face of greed shone brightly when the studio and actors kept making them it is incredibly disrespectful to have done so pardon the digression this film is terrific i liked how doug liman handled the end with franka potente is found by matt damon and ultimately kindle a relationshipmy main problem is clive owen doesnt have a larger role he is truly a brilliant actor he made up for it hiwever over tge nrxt decade appearing in many excellent films like children of men the international which the big shootout in john wick 2 copied completely and not half as well etc,intelligence
this was a refreshing take on the spy action thriller movie that helped reset the genres standards for the following 2 decades matt damon was perfectly cast in the role,intelligence
this movie will always be the best of its kind if for some reason you havent seen it  please watch it you wont be disappointed,intelligence
matt damon really is a badass i could watch this movie again and again and again this is my all time favorite its just perfect and brilliant and thrilling the cast the acting the soundtrack the fight scenes the car chase scene and matt damon completely blows my mind every time if you havent watched it yet trust me do it now,intelligence
this espionage movie is the first in the series of jason bourne films based on the popular coterie of books of the same name they succeed where the current james bond films fail while daniel craigs sociopath bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy the emotional sub plot in the jason bourne films are direct focused and sensibleit makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move throughout the series he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so blazes a path toward redemption having read two of the originals books this series is based upon i can say that the jason bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor matt damon had a lot to do with that this is an excellent action espionage series of films,intelligence
its interesting to reflect on bourne i and how social media was in its infancy and then full blown by the time jason bourne was released in 2016 here there are no cia closeup shots of jason running through the streets of beautiful paris getting dressed utilizing his mobile and so on its sort of gumshoe surveillance for the times 2002theres full blown plot and action in bourne i and i was impressed big time if you need bourne to sort out a dispute for you he wont let you downbourne i was released in the era of bush ii and blair and by the time we get to jason bourne in 2016 trump is on the brink of being elected to the white house,intelligence
and more action acting and direction more than competent continuous pursuit and escape judo jujitsu karate kungfu what have you spectacular international travelogues interminable car chases bond rebourne but with a different objective in a sense a less sophisticated counterbond who turns in his license to kill not too easy to follow the plot but it eventually becomes clear that the bad guys are part of our side enjoyable good stuff not to be taken seriously in spite of the several deaths the three discs in the trilogy hang together the same review does for all three supremacy and ultimatum,intelligence
this is one of the best movies and things to ever exist in the history of the universe i love this movie so much and it is an absolute must see in my completely honest opinion i cant tell you how many times ive seen this movie but lets just say its a lot everything about this movie is incredibleand the soundtrack is just incredible by john powell here on imdb i can only give this movie a maximum of 10 out of 10 but my true rating is 1000 out of 10,intelligence
i imagine a lot of people forget the more humble stealthy experience that is the beginning of the bourne storywhen a man is found afloat in the ocean he finds he has no memory of who he is when a shadowy covert operation begins to send assassins after him and watch his every move terrible truths are revealed as he is on the runhaving enjoyed films like the fugitive was a natural progression for me it is probably a massively underrated film especially since its own series got so bombastic identity is such a moody quiet and real experience damon plays a very subtle character in jason bourne a man who has no identity to define himself with but has hard truths to find answers for the film is not exposition heavy even when it frequently bounces from our hero to the men hunting him it maintains a strong sense of tension and mystery without ruining it with blatancy or over explaining everything something action movies do far too often directed by doug liman not paul greengrass who would continue the series and scored by john powell the film is drenched in a great atmosphere of tension and puzzle solvingthe characters too are compellingly human everyone is performing extremely well here brian cox chris cooper and franka potente clive owen is even briefly in this well cast film no one feels out of place unnecessary or poorly writtenthe action sequences are great too from what i remember of greengrass followup supremacy there was a lot of shaky cam and i was surprised at the lack of shaky cam in this movie sequences are very well shot giving kinetic weight yet not loosing the audience in the process and this was after gladiator when everyone wanted to do shakycam theres an awesome car chase too involving bourne escaping in an old mini cooper very memorable stuffall in all is a superb and solid action thriller that took everyone by surprise propelling one of the biggest actionespionage franchises since bond forward,intelligence
matt damon is perfect in this movie but he may have grown too mature and experienced in the followups of this moviei know it is correct for a movie to be different from novels but these changes in movie which are different from the novel is convincingly good enough the followups supremacy and ultimatum had too many changes that went too far and would not beat this one but if the changes of both followups are considered reasonable then they should gotten a new good actor who is matt damon and not grown too mature and experienced like matt damon tbh imo,intelligence
when we talk about spy movies we always think first about james bond or mission impossible we think gadgets supermodel lovers lavish glamour and the top edged super car each one of us would love to get an hand ontobut the bourne saga is so much different we dont have any of these we just have a man jason bourne struck by amnesia after being found in the middle of the mediterranean sea shot and unconscious a man who tries to find out who he is and how he got there a man who is also trying to escape from a bunch of mysterious assassins relentlessly tracking him down to kill him and marie the woman whos helping him despite her in his quest showing his unsuspected unarmed combat skills to surviveand we have a lot of action too efficient and very enjoyable to see each of the combat scenes is really thrilling and so is that car chase throughout paris its so well executed and you dont need anything more to keep us entertainedthe story itself is thrilling as we follow jason and marie throughout their journey from zurich to paris watching them getting really close to each other while trying to stay alive facing those cia assassins of course there is no doubt that jason is a cia assassin himself but thats not what causes the thrill watching them trying to survive is what makes us so attached and completely inthe leading couple matt damon and franka potente are truly awesome in their respective parts matt is mysterious and cold hes not much more different from the killers he takes down but hes opening himself with franka who plays that ordinary woman coping with his own problem but whose life changes forever when she accepts to bring bourne to paris with her austin mini and help him in his quest we are so far from the supermodel and the super car for surebut thats something we should look for realism those gadgets and the glamour is cool but so superficial jason and marie are much more like us besides the lethal and instinctive skills of jason of course were feeling so much more attached to them and this is one of the movies strengths maybe thats what pushed the james bond creators to rethink their copy and deliver us casino royale,intelligence
jason bourne identity is not like the action films you are used to its different and has an impressive plotthe film starts with a man floating in the ocean seemingly dead after being rescued by a boat the ship doctor brings jason bourne back to life by removing bullets from his body bourne  whose identity is lost and doesnt remember anything  begins a journey trying to discover who he is and uncovers some mysteries along the wayas i mentioned before this movie isnt one of the clichs that involves lots of bungeejumping explosions women and no plotthe jason bourne series is also a book adaptation  which i havent read yet  such as james bond and sherlock holmesalthough i like the movie in general i wasnt convinced with the fighting scenes they didnt give me the feeling jason bourne is an agile fighter flawless in combat however at the back of my mind the fighting scenes seemed unrealistic and unconvincingoverall the movie has got a decent plot brilliant actors and neat cinematography you will probably like this movie if you are looking for a more realistic action movie to watch,intelligence
the movie reminds me of a hitchcock thriller of course hitch filmed during a period of much slower tempo and would likely have emphasized emotional psychology over slambang action still its a heckuva thriller bournes got more lives than a cat and hed better thats because a secret agency of the us govt has got him in their sights seems the poor guy was an assassin for them but on one assignment got shot thrown into the sea and lost his memory now hes trying to find out who he is but in the process is jeopardizing agency plans for something or other so now theyre using all their technowizardry to take him out its like banks and banks of blinking circuits on his trail from bournes standpoint its like hes up against an entire unseen universe good thing hes got as many tricks up his sleeve as the agents tracking himi guess you could say this isnt exactly a promotional for our covert agencies their bureaucrats appear ruthless and unforgiving especially headman conklin whose neck is on the line on the other hand i think we sympathize more with bourne than like him given the bloody trail he leaves behind still i like the way the screenplay eases him into the relationship with marie making it more credible what i do have reservations about is that overlong and incredible car chase seems to me that careful use of a less can ironically add up to a significant more a lesson this sequence needs to apply anyway damons persuasive despite his boyish looks while potente gets to show her chops and in fairly subtle fashion all in all the movies a whiteknuckle two hours it also registers a popular change in how audiences view our govts covert agencies plus the slimy politicians who pitch for them,intelligence
this contemporary cia film was something like the french version of pirates of the caribbean in the end our protagonist jason bourne matt damon really only wants some high adrenaline the girl and some gold and silverbut before he hits the jackpot weve got to rock out with this curious george he really does monkey climb his way toward selfidentity spiderman he is not but he does hang from high places reverse rock climb on the side of a building though more like a tree frog than a monkey thats ok it looked very scary hes not really a frog trying to shake off amnesia from his enemy captors aboard a stormy ship off the coast of france he makes land successfully for a 20000 payoff to a frustrated single girl named marie she quickly becomes his ally his x for thrills and chills meanwhile he retrieves a lockbox of his essentials numerous passports one by the name of kane that leads him to a luxurious paris flat from authorities he learns that kane is declared dead from a transportation accident in the newspaper jason reads that he is an assassin marie and jason return to the road arriving at eamons quaint countryside home along with his two small children who is eamon maries brother lover exhusband the superficial contrast between idyllic pastoral life and gun toting sniper chases only sours our identity for bourne his untimely home invasion at christmas to eamons is simply an annoying artifice he looks more bumbling than bourne all through out this film and that is being nice i could say that he looks like one of the witchs evil monkeys from the wizard of oz is he an ant bully or just simply a pirate in search of his booty cia director alexander conklin chris cooper is like the witchs chief monkey ready to pole dance at bada bings shrug maybe that is really the better gig chris at monkey command central conklin going ape over his astray monkey jason finally captures the bugger conklins assistant nicky julia stiles has placed her drive thru order one chicken patty extramakeup pickle onion hold the lettuce and the tomato fries and a carton of milk and like dr evil conklin finger to chin reminds jason that jason is really a 30 million dollar super spy for the cia whose been making way too many mistakes bourne cant stand pressures from chief monkey conklin goes ape and breaks away yet again a free monkey at last still bourne is chased by what alliance were just not sure anymore but we do know that bourne is running for his life not his death where in the wheel does he land this time another quaint scene in a tropical caf situated on a beautiful scenic blueskied european coast where marie now conveniently resides uhh ohh are you thinking what i am thinking its the bourne pastoral tipoff is he going to tell marie that shes run from danger flee the caf jump off the cliff into the ocean or instruct her to immediately head to the basement if there is one hes in her arms but for how long who is jason bourne a reverse rock climbing evil monkey a thorn in some lions side or is he a teddy bear dressed in a nic cage snakeskin bomber jacket or a leprechaun smoking a cute little brown pipe the more interesting question might be whose world is more entertaining  waynes world or bournes world the film is directed by doug liman but be forewarned  this film is closely aligned to how jerry bruckheimer does gay paris,intelligence
this movie is horrible  matt damon does not fit the role of jason bourne if you want a better version see the version starring richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith made in the late80sthe 2002 version does not follow the book at all except for having a character named jason bourne  i feel so sad for those viewers who have never read the book and dont realize what theyre missingthe real story is so much better and interesting,intelligence
funny that in the dvd bonus they never mention that this movie is a remake of a tv movie starring richard chamberlain 1988 which was a far better film i personally dont think that you make a good action film just shaking the camera around like crazy mtv style there was more in the original movie and in the book that they left out in this easier version so much they left out that this movie doesnt really have legs on its own i reccomend the vision of the old film instead of this franca potente doesnt really make a good acting in this one just like the other female role in the original film who is a very cold and empty character most of the characters in this new version dont have personality they just stand there in the movie most annoying is the boring soundtrack and the special bonus video by moby what does that have to do with the film another one of those useless video for a completely out of tone soundtrack some nice action but because of the shaky camera you dont really enjoy those at least that goes for me,intelligence
the book the movie is based on is quite good  there was a two part tv movie made in 1988 that was followed the book quite closely but bad acting and low budget made to be just an average spythriller  the new 2002 version is very typical of hollywood screw ups by tuning good idea into video game run and shoot as enemies popping up from every direction  no suspense no twists and turns no need to think this brain function doesnt get performed in hollywood the plot in full view after first 15 minutes,intelligence
absolutely do not waste your time or money seeing this movie  i assume that everyone who gave this movie a good rating has never read the book  this movie has very little in common with the masterpiece written by robert ludlum  hollywood has changed everything from the book  i couldnt believe it when they introduced marie as a gypsy rather than a economist w a phd  where is carlos the worlds greatest terrorist who provides the main story line in the book  they wrote him completely out of the book instead of carlos henchmen trying to kill bourne the movie has cia operatives trying to kill him  they even changed the spelling of cain to kane why i stood up and literally booed when the credits rolled  i should have left 10 minutes into the movie but i guess i just wanted to see how bad they could screw it up  on a scale of 110 with 10 being the worst you can screw up a adaptation of a book into a movie gets a 10 puke  im vomiting now just thinking about it,intelligence
totally uninteresting nor believablesee long kiss goodnight instead or north by northwestthis film wishes it could compare,intelligence
this stink burger was so boring it put me to sleep i actually had a pretty good nap for about 15 to 20 minutes the best part was the car chase with the mini cooper automobile but now everyone is doing itand it now sucks on toast the only thing worse than a matt damon film is a richard gere film heaven forbid that matt and richard never team up wed have another target on the axis of evil list besides sucking wood chipsthis film is boring slow poorly acted and filmed dont waste your time matts pal ben made a much better film check it out instead sum of all fears is the film that matt damon wishes he wouldve made sorry matt you will always be second banana third banana when jho takes over i give this turkey 0 out of 5 stars,intelligence
i truly believe that this is the worst mid to highbudget film ive ever seen i dont want to insult the author of the books for the sequel was quite enjoyable but this film was indescribably bad  in fact i feel that in all future dvd releases of the trilogy it should be ruthlessly cut down into a 10 minute introduction to the second installationwhere to start the plot there is no plot other than the tired old premise of someone important losing their memory and turning against their former companions which isnt really properly explored the ending leaves much to be desired such as an ending other than one you might write at 3 am to meet a deadlinesince the film was produced for an american audience it would be unfair and stupid to complain that all of the french people were speaking english im willing to accept that were watching a magic translation of some kind but not when they dip in and out of french making it clear that they are supposed to be speaking largely english why were all the american agents large englishmen with yorkshire accents why were all the assassins incompetent firing 6 shots when 1 would have been enough to kill the target this film had no moral message the main character it is painfully obvious from the start is a trained killer his enemies are trained killers the romance felt like it had been written by edward bellamy nothing was satisfactorily resolved in fact in the second film there are several references to scenes i assume were edited out of the firstmore like the burned indelibly onto my brain because it was so bad,intelligence
this movie was a mess the should have let him drown at the beginning of the film matt damon obviously didnt read the script before signing on or he was blinded by the dollar signs in his eyes i have not read this book but i feel inspired now as i have no idea what this film was about,intelligence
i saw a review of another movie the sum of all fears that is apt for i cant remember the reviewers name so i cant give himher credit but it goes as follows1 if youve read the book dont bother to see this movie2 if you havent read the book go read it then see 1my own thoughts they couldnt follow the book too closely as the villain was carlos the jackal a reallife terrorist from the cold war era who was dealt with long ago and has been worn out in other movies the jackal starring bruce willis and the assignment with donald sutherland and aidan quinnnonetheless they basically traded off the books title to attract the books fans to what was otherwise a mediocre action film,intelligence
maybe i would have enjoyed it more or viewed it more objectively if it had been called something else but come on if youre gonna name the movie the same as the book it is supposedly based on shouldnt it at least resemble the original story enjoy the movie for what it is  a nonstop action flic but if you like suspense and spyvsspy stories i recommend reading the ludlum book for a completely different experience of heres some of the things that made the book interesting but were nowhere to be found in the moviebook spoilers followthe piecebypiece unraveling of jason bournes true mission before he lost his memoryhis violent abduction of marie and the slow turning of her feelings toward himthe traps and countertraps in the spyvsspy duel with the assassin carlos the jackal,intelligence
there were some well shot scenes and matt damons deadpan portrayal of the main character fits in nicely other than that if you know the basic premise of the film you have it all theres nothing more to it than that nothing too silly like bond films but no real suspense or drama either casting was good brian cox never gives a bad performance and clive owens turn about in character once caught is a nice touch i think you need to feel for the characters a little but i couldnt bring myself to feel one way or another about them all in all a bit of a let down i must confess i will still watch the bourne supremacy when i get the chance so it can have been all bad,intelligence
a man found floating in the mediterranean sea is rescued by a fishing trawler but when he recovers he cannot remember who he is a clue leads him to a safety deposit box in a swiss bank but he soon falls foul of the authorities until he hitches a lift with a girl called marie they travel to paris and try to unravel his mystery identity but the answers are not to his liking and sinister agents are quickly on their trail this is a handsome spydrama based on a book by robert ludlum which deserves kudos for being a traditional nojokes european action thriller in the vein of the ipcress file or day of the jackal it has terrific art direction some fine setpieces the escape from the zurich embassy the paris car chase some excellent locations and features a great percussive score by john powell for me though the plot is just a bit too familiar and clichd the big bad cia have computers that can show them whats happening on any streetcorner in the world but cant find one guy even when they know what he looks like where he lives and how he operates the amnesia shtick is good though a bit derivative of the long kiss goodnight where cox plays a similar role and the first half of the movie is very enjoyable but the resolution sucks  bourne turns out to be a badass assassin who gets all maudlin at the sight of his victims kids  gimme a break  did he flunk objectivity 101 at hitman college  as a grownup spy thriller though this is fine entertainment and zips along at a terrific pace shot in france italy greece and the czech republic,intelligence
the premise of the movie which comes from the ludlum novel upon which it is based is that of a mysterious character suffering from amnesia attempting to rediscover his past while other mysterious people are trying hard to kill him all movies require a suspension of disbelief to work and i found this one partially successful the acting ranged from mediocre to excellent with chris cooper delivering one of the strongest performances of all as the cia agent desperately trying to put the genie back in the bottle matt damon is ok as jason bourne but i just dont think he has much dramatic range at times he looks a little too much like the nice young man next door rather than the superbly trained assassin he is supposed to be brian cox orso guerrini and clive owen do more with less in much smaller roles franka potente is believable and interesting to watch as the accomplicelove interest she is attractive but not so dropdead gorgeous that it gets in the way i enjoyed the car chase sequence in paris the european setting and pace of the movie it was much more interesting and less formulaic than most spy movies ive seen,intelligence
spoilersi never got around to seeing before now im not sure why having seen lots of terribly thrilling trailers for the bourne supremacy i thought id get around to it i thought id really enjoy this film i like frederick forsyth books and i was quite the fan of jack ryan until all the weapons specs got too much for me but somehow this film failed to delivercertainly matt damon was believable as the confused assassin certainly all the ingredients of car chases espionage and techno gadgets were there but none of it ever came together and really did it for me there was virtually no chemistry with the leading lady and it all just seemed like it had been done before maybe the knowledge that there was a sequel ruined it  at no point did i feel that bourne was in any danger and i already know the ending disappointing,intelligence
this movie rates a 2 because it at least has a plot but matt damon just makes the movie really bad he cant do an action flick he is too cute he is notmuscular he is the kind of actor that girls fall for because hes soft rather than james bond because hes hard the other problem is that matts characterjason bourne is a mix of good and evil and that works for a drama like forinstance the ten performances i have seen as william shakespeares hamletbut not for an action flick like this,intelligence
its really sad when you see a potentially good filmmaker go hollyweed here doug liman go swingers proves hes no smarter than the average actor out to make a buck and matt damon whos made mostly intelligent choices in his career joins him whats really sad is how theyve seemed to convince themselves theyve made something different instead of just the usual hollyweed tripe this is tired trite predictable stuff no surprises at all but then this was written by a man who specializes in tired badly written novels the stephen king of spy thrillers there are plot holes you could drive the proverbial mack truck through as usual and the action sequences are just plain dull and predictable on a brighter note their are good performances from franka potente run lola run and the always reliable chris cooper and brian cox otherwise this is a 2 hour timekiller something you will quickly forget youve ever seen,intelligence
there is always a chasm between a book and its screen version some rare creators manage to overcome this gap and make equally good movie although not necessarily mirroring word after word but in the case of bi i agree with krokors from australia doubts on whether the screenwriter actually read the novel of the same name or just heard of it so watching this movie luckily for free otherwise id have regretted the spent money i tried to forget what is it made after the problem is that it didnt help to improve the impression either the movie has too many blunders the scenes which you just dont believe its not scifi after all i understand the eternal problem of the lack of time but the explanation of the plot behind the organisation totally lacked clarity not to say the question with those secret pillsall i liked about this movie was the car chase  rather good promotion of the car though probably the character of franka potente should have looked a bit more upset about the injured parisians in the car crashes if she is so sensitive about loving the killer but surely that question never was a problem for most of the screenwriters of the actions anyone watched a car chase from beware of the car that one is a good although funny and unreal exceptionso i cant recommend watching this stuff especially if youve read the book and like it,intelligence
perhaps having a few beers before seeing this was a good idea after allit was supposed to be an engrossing thriller if the book is anything to go by  which outshines the film by the way but it was actually dull and uninteresting and my thoughts about damon being a mediocre actor havent changed from seeing itthe relationship between him and his costar was scarcely believable and not very realistic and i was bored way too soon into the film,intelligence
i went and saw on a hunch  the possibility that this action flick would offer something different from the hohum and drum of hollywood to this point  i must admit the possibilities presented by the plot are numerous but the script just failed to take advantage of them of course we all knew how it was going to end up before we even took our seats  matt damon was obviously going to be the amazing hero that we know and love him to be  unfortunately it was no legend of bagger vance comeback but we knew what we were getting ourselves into my highest expectations lay in the realm of what would make this particular action film unique  i didnt find much  i had to moan out loud when the bondesque and wholly gratuitous romance began  granted i have a soft spot for our sexy lolita but i just didnt want this film to be a standard repitition of movies past the ending was the biggest disappointment  it was just a bit too blah  i think the confrontation in the safe house was p poor and left me longing for the excitement of the car chase that occurred way too early in the film the movie was down hill from there,intelligence
this movie had absolutely no point  i reread the book before going to see the movie but i really didnt have to  the only similarity was in the title character  none of the wonderful international intrigue was present and there was no chemistry in the romance  it didnt build  it just happened dont go see the movie read the book,intelligence
one thing i detest more than bad films are overrated films this was touted as dark and realistic all the things the bond films are not unfortunately they forget to make us care about the characters i lost interest in who bourne was long before the end of the film i was hoping the government forces would kill him off early and i could leave the cinemaso a blank slate of a man involved in lots of fighting for no particular reason and a love interestthats not really interesting one of those films that leaves you completely cold found myself wondering who the heck the people were who loved this film i pictured them also laughing at billy crystal moviesplease avoid the movie is worthless and its sequels,intelligence
one of the dumber espionage films ive seen in my life not only does it not have any resemblance to ludlums book it doesnt even deserve to lick the boots of the robert chamberlain miniseries and when youre worst than a chamberlain miniseries youre really bad the film is one big chase where bourne is pursued by dumb french cops gee isnt that an oxymoron and the evil american government notice the capitalization that goes around murdering civilians like they breathe air there is no subtlety whatsoever and im at a loss why they name this movie after ludlums book talk about tarnishing a great book,intelligence
the promos for mention that it is loosely based on robert ludlums book bearing that same title  loose is exactly the term for this filmfor starters there is absolutely very little connection between the greatness of the book and the littleness of the screenplay  indeed this bookscreenplay combo might well form the perfect example for illustrating the phrase digging a mountain to discover a mousemy major grouse relates to the characterisation of the protagonist  in the book it is one long intense and involving journey of selfdiscovery one that the reader not only vicariously enjoys but also relates to her own life  the screenplay contains zilch of this aspecttherefore there is little sense in grading this screenplay  the very concept is flawed  it is pure f at the very outset  of course if you were to view the film minus this background of the book it seems an okayish thriller but thats not the point  over here is a masterpiece that couldve made an exceedingly good screenplay  instead its gone to the dogsthe most awful thing about this whole business is that the books author robert ludlum himself is the executive producer hence mustve personally approved the screenplay  i am afraid hes getting on in years perhaps he ought to go in for mri scanning to check for cerebral strokes  no person in full control of his creative faculties couldve allowed such a degeneration of book content especially when it is his own  if he rushed into the job because of financial considerations then its a case of penny wise and pound foolish for a neat job of this screenplay wouldve surely assured good business for the sequelsto sum up losing ones hold on the creative faculty isnt a good thing at all,intelligence
where do i begin did mr ludlum loose his mind before he passed away how could he allow hollywood to destroy the beauty of his finest novel my favorite spy novel of all time based on a novel by robert ludlum is an understatement there is nothing from the novel except the name of the main character jason bourne who is not even the true identity of the main character but his cia cover  and the fact that he had amnesia and had a microchip planted in his hip thats it oh no wait he also worked for a cia cell called treadstone 71 where is the true assassin carlos the jackal the reason why treadstone created altogether the script writers obviously have a very naive and distorted understanding of how the cia works my dad was a cia officer and i can assure you that they do not go around killing people all over the world innocent as well as guilty just because someone at headquarters ordered them to do that they also dont sentence one of their field officers to death simply because they lost contact with him in the novel david webb was a washed out cia officer who underwent plastic surgery to take over the identity of well known assassin called jason bourne he spoke many languages european and oriental and was sent to draw out carlos from his hideout the beauty of the story is his relationship with the canadian economist marie stjacques and his quest to find out who he was in the movie jason bourne had to run away from other cia assassins while in the novel it was carlos and his men who were after him the cia was trying to figure out what happened to him not kill him and whose idea was it to cast matt damon in the lead role jason bourne is supposed to be in his 40s and not a young looking kid in the bourne supermacy he actually is a college professor and marie gets kidnapped im sure the hollywood version is completely different have not seen it yet when hollywood turned mission impossible into a movie they had the entire team killed turned the team leader into a traitor and left ethan hunt to be the solo hero now they butchered altogether please read the story or at least watch the tv movie with richard chamberlain it is more faithful to the novel what a disappointment this was if a story is good enough to be a bestseller why change it oh and the scene where matt damon rides a corpse down 7 floors and then walk away without a scratch i mean come on are you kidding me,intelligence
i am a huge fan of robert ludlum and have read many of his books being my favorite  i didnt go into the theater expecting the film to follow the book exactly but this movie didnt follow the book at all  they got the title right and amnesia and a bank account in zurich but thats about it  gone was the intrigue and the suspense and even the arch villain  if youre looking for a great spy yarn read  if youre looking for a dimeadozen action flick with no substance see ,intelligence
when i saw theatrical trailers for this movie i thought wow ive got to see this i didnt get a chance to see it until it was on cable i found it so boring it took 4 viewings for me to finish my only incentive to finish was when i saw the announcement for the sequel being released unfortunately this movie never improvedsupposedly there is mystery intrigue action and suspense but not much in my opinion and i appreciate other movies that are action packed and suspenseful and i really love an intricate mystery but as the story unfolds it never gets any more interesting the woman who drives him to paris and becomes a sidekick of sorts adds very little to the story except for someone to react to him and a reason for him to talk out loud i was hoping for intricacy with her in the storyline some backstabbing some former knowledge of him something of depth but nowhat i thought was weakest was the characterizations and bordered on laughable was that of the african minister and that played by julia stiles a teen movie princess turned into some threatening head of secret ops completely unbelievable they both seemed comical and you knew they were supposed to be serious all they served to do was to make matt damon slightly greater in stature in his roleeven the car chase scene was silly a mini cooper come on it wasnt a goofy golf course it was paris for goodness sake and they chose to feature a mini  spoilers in the next paragraph suspense even i expected someone to be in his apartment i knew the was outside the window the apartment manager would be dead and a dead dog meant danger to the family and so what he was good at wiping down fingerprints whoop dee doo were these supposed to be surprisesthe whole movie was like a long boring car trip i didnt want to take i ranked it a 4 out of 10 on the imdb scale,intelligence
is a great movie to begin a great series everything is pretty darn good with this film the movie is about a cia guy named jason bourne the movie starts with his being found by a group of fisherman and bourne not remembering who he was he teams up with one girl named marie and they got involved in a cia plot that involved killing the acting is very good in this movie matt damon and franka potente had great chemistry together also i liked the way that the cia were portrayed as evil the action in this film is great from beginning to end it kept me at the edge of my seat until the end credits the music is great to listen to because its fastpaced and it keeps up with the movie overall this is a good action flick i rate this film 1010,intelligence
with all the hype and slavering about the bourne franchise i rented this dvd i was expecting complex intrigue deep complex character development and believabilitywhat i experienced was an action flick with mostly wooden characters exception  clive owens brief appearance was most memorable the car chase was wayyyyy too long and looked hokey and staged for the last two thirds the movie could have been a good 20 minutes shorterbut it meets the needs of its demographic  1722 yo males or those whose discernment for more intelligent and wellcrafted suspenseintrigue has not matured beyond 25the chemistry between the two leads seemed contrivedand julia styles  why not a credible character in this moviei was so disappointed i had been really looking forward to this and the other two,intelligence
hollywood has done a miserable job in my opinion of translating these types of books into movies i grew up on tom clancy novels and have not felt as if any of the movies even came close to my expectations even with harrison ford in them i have not read the bourne books but i would have to say that i felt disappointed for those who have there were some excellent characters and character interactions just waiting to happen clive owens character had so much potential but was just unexploited the fight scenes were not bad and i think matt damon did an excellent job and franka potente looked great and did a decent job but the story never came together for me even though i could tell there was the making of a very good story given the first line of dialog of jason on the ship with the captain i could tell that they were trying to put the struggle of the character in 1 minute of the movie when it probably made a great part of the book granted some books make some good entertaining movies and this one was entertaining but it felt more like watching a set of cliff notes the story felt very rushed with little time spent on characters i loved the location shooting and that really added to the movie overall not horrible movie but nothing special,intelligence
i have recently read the entire bourne trilogy i couldnt put any of the 3 novels down robert ludlum is a great writer its a shame the same cant be said about tony gilroy who wrote the screenplay according to imdb at doug limans instruction screenwriter tony gilroy did not read novel instead he worked solely from an outline prepared by liman this i feel was the film greatest let down the only similarities between the book and the film is the names of some of the characters and the fact that jason bourne loses his memoryanybody who has read the book but not watched the film i would not recommend watching it cause you will be sitting there as i was wondering why any one feels the can completely rewrite ludlums masterpiece,intelligence
guess what not everybody read this book some of us just went to the movies and said entertain me and this movie did great story action characters fight scenes driving scenery music and pacing i look forward to the sequel or sequels 910,intelligence
is a typical hollywired megabuck  supertinselized bythenumbers mechanical overhyped product which tells its tale of an amnesiac superspy guy damon who has to find out who he is while trying to woo a babe and avoid a bunch of assassins and assorted cops etc out to get him this very busy film does nothing to distinguish itself has no soul or personality and very little heart is one contrived scene after another borders on scifi with too much unreal technojunk and takes itself much too seriously  if you listen to the music youll get a sense of import which far exceeds the onscreen nonsense on the up side however the film sports a good cosmopolitan cast features good locations and technicals and is slick and polished with enough style to be an entertaining nobrainer for action junkies bnote  it was nice seeing stiles keeping her mouth shut potente standing still cox speaking with an american accent and cooper in a lead role in a major flick,intelligence
is one of the greatest movies ive seen  the start of the movie is intriguing and accomplishes the purpose of grabbing the attention of the viewer  the actions sequences in the movie were original with a new muchfasterpaced fight than ever before  i found that the sequence of punches was so fast that it was amazing to watch because it looked so realistic  which it should the fighting style was new as well one which id never seen before  as marie entered the picture it took on a more spirited and colorful dimension as her character contrasted that of bourne  even though julia stiles has a minor role she does nothing to disgrace her reputation as a capable actress  the roles were wellselected and the movie was a great success in my opinion  i can easily say it is one of my favorites,intelligence
a man is dragged from the sea by a fishing boat with bullet holes in his back and a device containing details of a swiss bank account in his hip unable to remember who he is or what happened he goes to the bank to find many passports a lot of money and a gun  when he leaves the bank he finds that he is being targeted by the police and another more sinister force as he puts the pieces together he realises someone is trying to kill him but who and whyi went to see this for free at the audience preview in birmingham and i was genuinely looking forward to it and i pretty much wasnt disappointed  the plot is nothing special and doesnt go anywhere too surprising but it still makes for an enjoyable ride and is quite thrilling  the journey is good and it is fun to uncover jasons past and skills with him  the ending is ok but it has some elements that are dumb  like hes a killer but hes a nice killer who cant kill kids and the usual happy hollywood endingi havent read the book so i dont know how closely it followed that but i think they did a good job despite falling into several clichs along the way  the locations are well used and the director doesnt go into travel agent mode the way many directors do when you give them european landmarks to film  the pacing of the movie was a little too slow at times and there were patches where it dragged  but then the thrills did last for the majority  the lack of explanation in the plot bothered me a little bit but i suspect sequels are already in the pipeline  also i kept thinking of how much fun the long kiss goodnight wasdamon was pretty good  he was convincing and cool but maybe a little bland at times  potente i dont like  she got annoying with all her swearing in german etc  she did ok but i wasnt ever totally sold on her character chris cooper is great despite being office bound for the majority  brian cox was also good but why was he cast was it an injoke that he was also in the long kiss goodnight  i dont know why stiles was in this for all she got to do  maybe she had a free weekend to do some shots  my only disappointment was the screen time of adewale agbaje  he is a great actor doubters should watch his 3 season performance in oz on hbo and i hoped he would have a big role  alas he doesnt have much screen time and his role is only his usual nigerian stuff with no scope for showing what he can do  someone give this man a film vehicle to show his skills pleaseoverall this is a solid thriller  the plot is a bit clichd but it moves along well and is only occasionally a bit slow  the ending is the price you pay for a hollywood blockbuster but other than that its harmless saturday night fun and thrills,intelligence
look i dont mind if a movie differs from a book if the changes are equally as good better or more cinematicbut the only thing this movie has in common with the book besides the name of the character and a few people in the movie is the original premisebeyond that this film is just different  and it is far worse in the change  they tried to skew it younger and meaner and made the us government more evilit is less fun less realistic far shallower and just stupid most of the timei cant understand why they took a perfectly good book which had been made into an award winning two part tv movie and made it into such a piece of garbageeven my cousin who is a manager and producer and loves most films was not at all impressed with this film  i was shocked and showed me just how bad it wasluckily there were some cool scenes and matt damon was pretty good with what they gave him but that cant make this movie worth paying 10 to see,intelligence
the story follows a guy who wakes up with two bullet holes in his back and with amnesia not remembering even his name as he begins to unfold his identity he learns that he is a highly trained assassini dont really like this movie it feels kind of cold sad and boring at times thats the best description i can find with it it is in my opinion highly overrated but nevertheless a solid action movie to watch on a lazy day,intelligence
this is one great piece of spy thriller action goodness matt damon absolutely reinvents himself into a total badass while at the same time retaining his boyish sensitivity the action scenes are claustrophobic and intensely realistic loved it,intelligence

2002 is the first installment in the famous bournefranchise if you want to get as much out of it as possible there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watchingsome attention needs to be paid to the minor characters especially the different assassins the more you understand and get from the first half the more sense the second half will makehas a bit of everything  tension sensuality and surely violence neither part however is overly prominent except perhaps the violence in the third act to the degree where it is detracting from the overall story and characters the focus stays steady and the tone doesnt shift very much throughout the runtime not a lot else needs to be said  prepare for a thrilling dive into one of the greatest action movies of the 2000smy overall grade 810,intelligence

the setting was interesting my favorite was a driving scene i must watch this series immediatelyi didt see why matt damon was so popular till recently and i dont think he is a nice looking guy still but his kiss scene was very awsome i was so suprised,intelligence
the movie starts off dramatically you are with the protagonist as his story unfolds he does not remember who he is you can just figure out that he is something special when he beats cops effortlessly escapes from buildings and drives at erratic speeds without getting hurt matt damon essays the author backed role to the t he is perfect in every scene it keeps you on the edge throughout although i was a bit disappointed with the climax,intelligence
wow matt damon and franka potente are perfect this movie contain many action but doug liman director and oliver wood director of cinematography dont know how to film it i hate this shaky camera i cant even see the actors thank god the rest of the movie is good,intelligence
not as legendary as rambo bond or even ethan hunt jason bourne still has a reputation of a total badass with a completely messed up background story both from his and our perspective which is let me tell you awesomethe idea is hot as grannys cookies straight out of the over but the taste gets bitter with a very slow pace and the topping of randomness and unexplained throughout the movie i didnt experience moments of excitement that usually accompany action sequences what i actually felt was resembling a sense when a pregnant woman gets a little push from the baby its exhilarating but its only says that the little treasure is there but you still cannot see it getting to the ending my hope for the sequel grew with a speed of a bamboo tree because i dont want to lose such a character on screen of course we are still left with books but matt damon deserves a second shotanother cool feeling was emerging when we ran with characters locations are picked incredibly they make you feel like you are there for real and sometimes you get the spark that can launch your hands in the air when the music kicks in and bourne starts showing off his skills which is like a delicacy among the ocean of porridgeoverall as said before the concept is like honey for the bees and lots of money can be made on this sweet stuff of idea but the first taste was a little bit bland i am willing to give it a second chance to wrap around the viewer and crawl into his head,intelligence
one for the books great story plot thickens at every turn characters are relatable even the supporting cast are top notch clive owen and company note withstanding friday movie night just got better,intelligence
16 june 2002 taking into account three or four weak points in this spy thriller boasted a wonderful car chase scene that didnt necessarily go over the top which included much more realistic images of passing cars a matt damon that hit the ground sometimes literally running with his deft moves and struggling to find his identity theres even a female who knows when to stay and when to run i cant imagine though how another cia assassin can expose himself so easily in the movie unlike enemy at the gates the cat and mouse game was too easy which takes place in an open field how a meeting place could be so lax in cia surveillance and how one character a supporting role could ever be left a live at the end of the movie but even so the movie is compelling always entertaining and pretty easy to follow todays current events however cast a deep shadow over this movie now that cia assassinations appear to have received the stamp of approval by the president the us government and even the american public i guess the collateral damage and corresponding retaliation is worth the risk,intelligence
this movie is goodthe reason that its so good is because of jason bournecharacterjason bourne is an compelling character who goes through an pretty great character arc cause if jason bourne wasnt as good as a character as he is this movie would have been a 310in the beginning of the movie we already get to know what his name is and his name is when his birthday is and where he was born thats all we know about him but then we see that he has a lot of passports saying that he lives in canada schweiz etcand then when get to see that he has a hidden compartment and there there is guns and moneywe never know why he took all of the money and threw the gun i think its because he was aware that people where watching him so he needed to take the stuff and escape and that beginning scene was amazingso we get to know a bit who jason bourne ishis desire is easy survival he wants to try to do the right thing and survive while knowing more about who he is thats his two desiresthe people who are giving him a challenge doing so is alexander and his team they are tracking bourne to kill himhe dosent face a lot of challenges but its a fun ride nonethelessand change he dosent change a lot as a person which isnt a flaw in the moviethe change we get is that bourne remembers what happend and what he did and who he really isrelationshipthis is gonna be short but i like how they deald with the relationship between bourne and marie they kissed and they are a couple but they dont show that they are an actual couple cause the thing i hate with certain movies is when characters relationship dosent develop that well but they become a couple and they act like a real couple kissing each other loving each other even though their relationship wasnt that much developed but that dosent happen in they kiss in one scene and thats it they show a little bit that they love each other but they dont show that much and marie isnt even there like 30 or 40 of the movie cause bourne made a choice to keep her safeactionthe action is decenti feel like they could have gone more creative with the action cause all it was was jason fighting bad guys and it just felt like there was no emotion to the actionexample the car chase it was the worst scene in the movie cause it felt tedious and it didnt have any stakesmost of these action scenes dont have any stakes but it didnt bother me that muchverdictis a solid movie i think you guys will like cause it has a great character arc when it comes to jason bourne,intelligence
the world of espionage has been captivating the attention of audiences for decades almost everyone loves a good spy movie in 2002 doug liman directed adapted from the novel by robert ludlum which took a new and interesting take on the classic espionage thriller raised the bar for spy thrillers and started off a series that has spanned 5 movies and 14 yearsin the movie jason bourne matt damon is found floating in the mediterranean sea by a fishing boat he has been shot twice in the back has no idea who he is and the only form of identification on him is a laserpointerlike gadget holding the information to a swiss bank account that had been implanted in his hip soon after reaching the mainland bourne realizes that he isnt the kind of person who works a 95 desk job he has increased awareness to his surroundings and his own limits and he can easily beat up whoever gets in his way after finding numerous passports a lot of money and a gun in his swiss safe deposit box bourne enlists the help of marie franka potente to drive him to paris in exchange for 10000 dollars bourne and marie develop feelings for each other on the trip to paris so upon reaching paris marie decides to stay with bourne and help him discover who he is following clues to bournes identity bourne and marie travel around europe trying to piece together who bourne is and was all while trying to avoid the cia the cia believes bourne has gone rogue and they are doing everything they can to track him down and kill himthe movie is centered on bournes search for who he is this search for identity is what keeps the audience involved and working with bourne to piece together who he is in a scene soon after bourne leaves the fishing boat bourne is sleeping on a park bench and is woken up by two police officers who are looking for trouble bourne replies to the officers in their own language without hesitation and this is our first clue that there is a lot more to bourne than we know after one officer pulls out their club and the other draws their gun bourne knocks them both out and disassembles the gun in a matter of seconds after this incident bourne looks at his arms wondering the same thing as the audience how does he know how to do that during these fight scenes the camera is quickly shifting from angle to angle to show the details of what is happening in the fights this combined with hearing what bourne is hearing gives the audience more of a firsthand fight experience also the lighting and color during the action scenes of the movie is typically brighter and more vivid throughout the movie reaction shots on bourne are frequently utilized because bourne is always the first one to realize when there is danger close  as bourne is piecing together what he used to do he doesnt want to believe that he killed people for a living he realizes that he and the people around him will never be safe until he ends things with the cia so he decides to fight back so that he can live a different life a life that includes marianear the end of the movie when bourne is confronting the cia agent who was in charge of him the agent says that bourne is a malfunctioning 30 million dollar weapon and tells him some details about the mission he was on right before bourne was found by the fishermen the agent says that bourne had set up the entire assassination plan himself flashes of light pictures and different lighting is then used to show a flashback to when bourne is on the boat of the target where the assassination was supposed to take place during this flashback we see that bourne failed the assassination because the targets young children were laying on top of him and bourne couldnt kill the target knowing that the guys young children would be forced to watch their fathers assassination this is when we learn one of the most important pieces of information relating to bournes identity he is an assassin but he is much more than just an expensive weapon bourne has compassion and a conscious that guides him this character progression causes to be an enjoyable film from start to finish,intelligence
the only real issue with this fastpaced exciting and involving mysteryactionthriller one that truly uses all three genres as core tenants of its narrative is its occasionally cartoony sounddesign this is most prevalent in its fight sequences mainly in its standout pen fistfight and severely reduces the impact of these otherwise engrossing and believable  not to mention realistic  setpieces however its a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things considering that this is easily one of the tightest and most intriguing actionthrillers of its generation along with its two sequels it kicked off a whole new kind of movie in the way that only a true classic could and its a joy to watch from beginning to end it really is masterfully constructed to be as suspenseful engaging and exhilarating as possible while remaining remarkably restrained too its also distinct from its followups in that it never really shakes the camera though it is edited quite quickly during the highvelocity moments  which include a phenomenal car chase  even if the cutting speed never reaches that of its successors this leads to a consistently legible and uniquely styled piece that legitimately stands out as one of the best in its genre 810,intelligence
introduced matt damon as jason bourne and he is simply amazing doug liman is great at action sequences as well as pacing the film and he excels here damon is as already enthusiastically mentioned above really good as the spy jason bourne who is found in a state of confusion when the film begins i never got the chance to see the rest of the films but this was a very good thriller from liman which reminds me to go see them,intelligence
fantastic film as a standalone and part 1 of a trilogy this film is packed with memorable moments and has great characters it does a brilliant job at creating mystery and questions a great of its genre,intelligence
i reckon ive seen this film a while ago and wasnt really all that impressed with it so i basically let the rest of the franchise slip through my fingers then again that is probably a good thing since there are so many franchises and so many films these days that keeping up with all of them is a chore in and of itself still a part of me wanted to give it another shot even though im not a big fan of spy thrillers and in a way i am really glad that i did i guess the last time i watched it i was a somewhat tired and wasnt able to get into it in fact im sure this film is also based on an older film that i also loved or even a book though i havent read the book and am unlikely to do so anyway i suspect the plot of this film is quite well known a man is fished out of the ocean though how he managed to survive is beyond me  he should have been well and truly dead especially if he is floating face down and basically cant remember a thing however there is something implanted in him which reveals a swiss bank account number to cut a long story short it turns out that he is a skilled assassin and is being hunted down by the cia for some reason or another though it turns out that he failed a mission and needs to be well killed not surprisingly he also picks up a female partner to travel with him on his adventures ah dont you just love hollywood cliches well yeah it is a spy thriller and it really did end up keeping me drawn in right through to the end okay it turns out that you pretty much know a lot more than what he does which does drag the film down somewhat in a way it is a shame in that regards because it would have been so much better if they had kept the whole cia business hidden away behind the scenes so that everything was being revealed to us as it was being revealed to him in a way it did subtract from a lot of suspense not surprisingly though he does get his memories back eventually though it is rather dubious as to how they actually came about  there really wasnt any trigger for that to happen and once again it might have been better for it not to have actually happened im not really all that sure if there is much more that i can say about this film though it is sort of a straight out action thriller and i suspect that the various sequels are going to be pretty much the same still it was a pretty cool idea though as i have mentioned it is hardly original since i believe that it is based on a book of course the period in which this film is set suggests that there was probably been some significant diversion from the original since the good old evil empire that was the soviet union no longer exists but then again this is also very much about a government agency that has gone completely out of control though apparently it was quite like that at the height of the cold war with cia operatives basically living it up in europe not surprisingly this does translate over to similar films particularly since most of the action takes place in paris though a part also takes place in switzerland so yeah this was a pretty cool film and ill probably go and watch the sequels some time soon,intelligence

this is a great film that i have seen a few times now and it never gets oldthe movie flows very well with a combination of action and detective work there are some great moments of detail such as the short climb down the outside of the american embassy not a spectacular climb by any means but plausible and well observed and it made me want to try it but i would want a big air bag at the bottom just in case i think the fight choreography is very good and appears realistic to me and lots of scenes remain in the memory such as the outwitting of the clive owen character in the countryside and the car chase with the little miniwithin the imaginary world of the film the characters all perform well and true to the story,intelligence
it was a classic spy movie even though theres plenty of action i never feeled excited ever in the entire movie mind you that im not a fan of spy movies or action movies so il say this it was a good spy movie but not a good movieif you dont like spy movies or action movies like me and watch this thinking that maybe once u might change ur opinion about these types of movies dont watch it ,intelligence
is an amazing action thriller it perfectly balances action and thrills in a perfect proportion today many spy themed action movies are compared to this one and its while watching the film itself i discovered why the concept itself is an interesting one jason bourne is a relatable and unforgettable character brought to life by matt damons energetic performance as well as doug limans skilled direction the film has excellently shot and brilliantly choreographed action sequences each and every action sequence is memorable and there are a lot of intensely thrilling moments as well jason bourne is a well written character and matt ensures he delivers a top notch act to make this portrayal a memorable as well as realistic one another credit to franka potente who plays her part in a terrific manner and does justice to her character which doesnt feel irritating or pointless but important instead the entire cast fits in their respective roles and delivers a good performance the editing is top notch as the entire screenplay works without any hiccupsthat being said is a captivating action thriller with a watertight script and no dull or unwanted moments im now eager to watch the entire bourne film series and undoubtedly i would love to own the dvd,intelligence
3 step review1u liked other bourne movies u will like this bourne debut this is a no brainer best bourne ever2 the story rogue intelligence assasin is on the run will he live will he die 90 min action chase3 doug liman tony gilroy remember those names doug liman is in my opinion the ultimate best director of all the bourne movies i love the other bourne versions as well but doug liman made the mold he created the original the core and he did so with masters skills i havent seen the equivalent of yet doug liman not only directed he also produced this debut that means he had almost total controll over how he wanted to shape it and that can be noticed in the attention to detail everything from editing to photography to soundtrack is one it is a perfectly mixed blend of just the right ingredients to make bourne one of the biggest action heroes in modern cinema it is a rush an adrenaline kick and doug liman is to be thanked for thattony gilroy is the screenplay writer of this classic action packed thriller although it is based on a novel by robert ludlum and however underestimated writers can become in action movies i herald the power of tony gilroys words in bournes debut most of all i like the friction between the characters everyone is under pressure under intense pressure not only matt damon but everybody connected to this assasin on the run story is likely to get wasted in a storm of bullets supporting roles are excellent at a level unheard of in most blockbusters that is typical of all the bourne movies in which acting is paramount the story and the words that make these characters believable are what tony gilroy is to be thanked for and when i can believe in the characters on the screen then i know i can enjoy a movie time and again you are about to see the very best in modern action movie history the bourne debut i must have seen it dozens of times and i still cant get enough of it,intelligence
is the original and first film of the bourne franchise this film sets the tone and has a very unique and thrilling feeling towards it once the plot sets it and it becomes on the move the film becomes an instant great entertainment the plot and storyline is relentless like a jigsaw puzzle the pieces take time to form any kind of sense filled with gripping moments and enough thrills is one of the best action thrillers matt damon is great as jason bourne whose loss of memory becomes less disturbing than the revelations he discovers about himself overall does what it maintained to do which after 15 years later has produced several more successful sequels,intelligence
the bourne saga never aroused my interest it was never a saga that i liked so much i know it is reference for action films but it is not the type of movie that when i watch i already want to watch the continuation so much that i delayed much to watch everyone is the first of the saga the plot has its mystery what made me watch the whole movie was to want to know more of the character jason bourne the action scenes are very well directed the soundtrack is competent but the movie never left me totally interested in no time that i was blinking to be intrigued by the film is an action film that i believe most will like but will always have people like i thought it was cool but i expected something more note 68,intelligence
pursued by unknown enemies a worried amnesiac tries to remember who he is and why he has such sharp reflexes in this action thriller yarn as the protagonists discovers a stash of fake passports each with his photograph and as police agencies seem to track his every move the film has a decent dose of mysteriousness the action sequences are well filmed and memorable too with a scene in which lead actor matt damon scales a large wall and a sequence in which he has to allude an assassin played by clive owen in some cornfields standing out in particular clocking in at around two hours though the film sometimes feels bloated with a lot of a cutaway sequences in which military types debate what to do about damon while these add exposition they also subtract from the immediacy of the action a heavily foreshadowed romance between damon and franka potente who gives him a ride further distracts from the central plot and damons personal identity crisis is hardly all that juicy the film is all about damon embracing his old identity as opposed to something like total recall which is about attempting to deflect from what one once was that said the eventual revelation of how damon lost his memory comes with much bite with a haunting nearsilent scene on a luxury yacht at night damons increasing anxiety at not being able to get answers comes across well too with some very good scenes in which he dials up various numbers asking for his names on his various passports in the desperate hope of some clue,intelligence
its sad when a perfectly good novel is used only for the barest of plots and character names  it seems that tony gilroy made this adaptation without even reading the book  mr gilroy went for the modern take on the movie and threw out the entire premise for there being a jason bourne  carlos the jackal was the perfect foil for bournewebb  by eliminating him gilroy had to come up with a very contrived assassin ring that has been done to death  thereby eliminating any possiblity of sequels such as the bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatum  i cant believe i actually liked the 1988 version with richard chamberlin and jacklyn smith better than this one,intelligence
what happened to carlos in this new version i guess he was out of date for the y chromosome generation huh in this film matt damon plays jason bourne like he was some kind of james bondlike superman who get nary a scratch while fighting his many opponents he even gets to beat up policeman and us embassy staff like theres no tomorrow while trying to find out who he is hes like an unstoppable robot whos martial arts skills put wesley snipes in blade to shame i suppose this as well as the mtvstyle editing and quick cuts will appeal to the teen and twentysomething headbanger idiots who think this is hot stuff but i found it utterly implausible and ridiculous an insult to my intelligenceat least richard chamberlain was more believable as a man who was caught up in events beyond his control even in the 1988 miniseries chamberlain handles a gun very awkwardly and doesnt fight very well so as far as im concerned he makes a more believable jason bourne than damon does plus that was more faithful to the ludlum book than this pile of crapgrade f,intelligence
as i am a huge fan of robert ludlum i looked forward to seeing this film and what a disappointment it was maybe as such a fan i should have been prepared and the review should have stated that it is only loosely based on the ludlum novel of the same name if i hadnt have read the book i would have been completely mystified by a lot of it matt damon as jason bourne is simply not believable and the character of marie unrecognisable from the books if any ludlumbourne fans want to see a valid representation of the story you can do no better than to seek out the video version with richard chamberlain  it follows the story and amazingly enough chamberlain is jason bourne,intelligence
boy was this ever a bomb sorry i just cant buy any of the characters in this movie matt damon as a uberassassin who loses his nerve and memory becausewhy potentes dialogue seemed to be mostly a german expletive and whos the nancy drew secret agentlookalike that runs the paris operation i also loved matts boss who wants to clear the safehouse in paris of anything that will indicate a presence and then proceeds to put his hands and fingerprints everywhere absolutely priceless in its stupidity i particularly liked the dubious morality at the end when all the killings and misery that lil matt has caused during his operations are magically washed away and forgiven cause he and franka found love i guess this movie is ok if all you want to see are things blowing up cars defying all laws of gravity and physics and people shooting big guns personally i prefer a good plot and believable characters but i guess thats not everyones cup of tea,intelligence
the problem with is that weve seen it all before and done much better we also have been spoiled by ten years of xfiles episodes which have pretty much explored every horror theme and conspiracy theory out thereknowing that could have been saved like xxx mission impossible by original action scenes and stunts and by a main character who has a much more ambiguous look than matt damon damon is simply way too pretty and bland to hold your interest for very long franka potente likewise is attractive but in a bland sturdy germanic wayi dozed off half way through woke up again and saw the second half of the movie another day the problem is i hadnt missed much if anything the story could be picked up just as well with half of the movie missing  not a good sign for a thriller or spy moviethey had the budget they had lots of sort of interesting locations italy and france are no longer as exotic as they were 50 years ago when no one traveled very much they had some starsa major issue is that the theme is not outlandish or involving enough to capture your attention hes a spyassassin something went wrong on his mission and now someone is trying to kill him huh really who could it be who cares i mean would your life be improved if you found out is it really worth over 1 12 hours looking at matt damon looking puzzled the sparks between damon and potente arent exactly flying either and brian cox is now so much associated with low budget movies that i dread every time he appears on the screen with the exception of the 25th hour of course  in which he actually got to act what happened to all the potential he showed in manhunter,intelligence
i just saw these films and look forward to a sequel these bourne movies rock the best action since raiders of the lost ark as opposed to the recent james bond movies the bourne movies actually makes sensethe cia is portrayed as a violent corrupt brainwashing cult and bourne as an archetypal warriorhero trying to fight his way out meantime he is being attacked by cianinja assassins and he himself is one of them these people are the only ones who fight back normal people dont the ciatreadstone as they are called assassins are obviously trained very well in martial arts highly recommended the first one is even better than the second i think bourne is more cool in the second but the story in the first one is even more astonishing 1010,intelligence
as spy thrillers go this one has handsome location scenery car chases narrow escapes and enough implausible fistfights and killings to keep any plot spinning until the happy ending fadeout its all done in a brisk stylish nononsense manner and played believably by matt damon his escape from the top floor of a building would make spiderman proud franka potente as the girl and chris cooper who tends to overplay the role of a cia man obsessed with capturing and killing the amnesiacridden hero matt damons fans will be impressed by his judo and action stunts that appear to be his own not a doubles his overall performance however is a bit on the bland side and lacking in the urgency his character should be displayingthe plot is never given anything but a sketchy viewpoint so that the viewer is just as baffled all the way through as the hero is this can become a bit unsettling as we go into the second hour of the movie still not knowing why his life is in such constant danger from the cia operatives trying to kill him the ending leaves too many questions unanswered with less than satisfying resultsbut for those who like spy thrillers this one might be just what youre looking foras long as you dont want to know all the answers,intelligence
 out of matt damon stars as jason bourne a man whos found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back  hes salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life  after he recuperates he heads to shore to find his true identity  with the assistance of a pretty german woman franka potente bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracksis an interesting summer thriller  its certainly not an allout action blockbuster as the previews might lead you to believe but there are some terrific action sequences  what truly makes the film work is damon himself whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging  the movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes  from a certain pointofview franka potente isnt useful except as a love interest and on that level her presence works  not only is she a fine actress but she and damon share a palpable chemistry  hopefully shell return in the sequel and this series wont go the bondmi route with a new love interest in every installment  take note hollywood steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciateds premise is similar to the long kiss goodnights but unlike that movie takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a characteroriented drama which it does  once bournes past is revealed not that it isnt that hard to figure out the film loses a bit of momentum but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion compared to say bond triple x or mifor action fans theres enough here to keep them satisfied with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of paris ive seen at least two other films with auto chases set in paris ronin the transporter and this ones my favorite even though its also the shortest and features the least attractive car a mini as compared to an audi in ronin and a bmw in the transporterthere are a few disappointments here and there particularly bournes showdown with the professor clive owen which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge buildup  julia stiles is also in the film and her presence is rather distracting i cant look at her without thinking hey its julia stiles in a role that could have been played by just about anyone  but in the end succeeds because it rarely goes overthetop no megalomaniacal billionaires here maintains an even tone and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling,intelligence
matt damon is not jason bourne he has neither the looks nor the age to be jason bourne this is a man who should have a lot of savy miles under his belt there is no way you can buy this the richard chamberlainejacquelin smith version is so much better its not damons fault unless you blame him for taking the role the direction is pedestrian as is every formulaic scene,intelligence
i laughed so hard at the ridiculous fight scenes that i had to shut the film off for a while totally unbelievable characters and film absolute suspension of intelligence and belief are required to watch the only positive feature of this flick is the genuine attempt of matt damon to be a serious actor you really feel sorry for him he is so obviously out of his depth damon is no spy american intelligence is a true oxymoron as chris cooper and brian cox are portrayed as two faced bumblers clive owen should have been the main character instead of the struggling damon owen and his craft are wasted and he has all of 3 or 4 lines in the film it was nice to see simon adebisi from oz in a film even a lame one such as this the fight scenes are mere cartoons and hilarious and their pathetic execution are the highlights of this film the one scene where a wild haired blonde guy with swimming goggles flies through the window firing a machine gun is the best the fight continues in super fast and slow mode and once beaten and killed the bad guy rises up like nosferatu it was a direct rip off of jim careys fantasy fight scene in dumb and dumber youll wet your pants poor matt damon 1 out of 10,intelligence
i didnt like it in spite of the reviews the director tried really hard to simulate the cerebral featurelength epics of the 70s and only succeeded at putting me to sleep the story sorry didnt read the book made fifthgrade assumptions about what goes on in cia circles you dont send in snipers one miserable and random failure at a time in plain sight to finish a fellow op off im sure even the incorrigible cia gives their employees the benefit of the doubt none given herei guess the matt damon character was the good guyi couldnt really tell i was so sick of his paranoia and the fact that he was so comfortable in his role of killing people yet he had flashes of humaneness yeah whatever i wanted him dead i was pretty sick of his girlfriend too this waste of time had a million holes in its plot howd he get to switzerland switzerland is a major fortress why was the african guy targeted i was never convinced he was good or bad why were the french so lame why didnt the cia practice triangulation why did the cia not practice more discrete forms of assassination what the hell was with the blonde chickwhy did we care about her why was the bureau chief so constipated werent the french the least bit curious about the machine guns in their hotels why did the french guy in the countryside just up and quiti give it a 2 for yawnfest a 2 for naive unreality and a 2 for who gives a poop about any of these people au revior,intelligence
the tv series that preceded this is far superior much closer to the book and with much more depth and really good supporting cast the only noteworthy things in the damon version is a quite cool car chase and how sadistic damons character is played when i saw this version i was hoping that it would be at least close to the original version but boy was i wrong they took out the plot the characters and missed out on the settings famke potente was good in run lola but is misscast in tbi just like chris cooper who usually is really good in supporting roles but he probably gave up trying after reading the supercliched script why should he waste any of his talent in this film when surely no one else did my advice is avoid this and instead see the original or read the book some very deranged people compare matt damon to james bond claiming that bond should move over  great joke damon is about as charismatic and believable as a ironing board in comparison,intelligence
that wasnt a brand new idea  of making a movie about superspy lost his memories well may be that happens to often poor guysits pale or may be even flat no feelings no thoughts even no humour some chase mini rocks yaaawn boring and predictable so matt damon couldnt save the movie  he had nothing to do to play but a couple of tricks so the coolest thing in the whole story is that advanced laser pointer in russian translation they called it microfilm ughand by the way those attempts to put slavic languages in the movies are boring too you know a supermegahyperabsolutespy risks a lot if he tries to use a passport with a senseless bunch of cyrillic letters instead of name what a shame,intelligence
i am a big fan of robert ludlum i have almost all the books he wrote and the bourne trilogy is one of the besti wanted to see this for a very long time thinking that i finally could see if what i imagined while reading this book would look like on screeni was completely disappointed seeing this movieeverything in it is pure crapthe names of the characters arent the same their backgrounds like their jobs and where they came from is not right eitherthey didnt even talk about carlos geez hes the guy that makes the other 2 books the bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatum possibleif you read the book dont go see this movie,intelligence
follows jason bourne as he loses his memory and tries to discover who he is but ultimately learns that he possesses a set of skills abnormal to regular people meanwhile his employers begin to search for him the bourne trilogy has become known as an exceptional action series but is it really not really matt damon to start is good as jason bourne in this movie at least hes just good his performance isnt anything special it doesnt stand out or anything its just good the rest of the performances are the same just good as for the action scenes theyre kind of average actually throughout the entire movie the fight scenes include a lot of the use of the shaky cam technique shaky cam is usually used to cover up how bad a movies action choreography is and still make the movie intense the only real problem is that the choreography is good but its just poorly presented thats not to say that the action isnt entertaining its just cheated for no real reason overall despite the negativity i had run with this movie there isnt much to say about it but its pretty good is it amazing no but its fun enough in the end i would still recommend this movie,intelligence
there have been previous attempts to bring bourne to the screen most notably the awful made for tv movie with richard chamberlin and jaclyn smithbut this movie is one of my favourites that i can watch over and over againmat damon really carries this off and captures robert ludlums jason bourne ok in the book he is slightly older but apart from that this movie is how i imagined things from reading the bookthere are things omitted probably to keep the movie from going on too long but it moves at a good pace and keeps you interested throughoutall supporting actors are good franka potente is very good and holds her own as marie brian cox is excellent as always and interesting to see both clive owen and julia stiles in relatively minor roles but carrying their parts off really wellthe director doug liman must surely get credit for bringing to the screen this complex and interesting character,intelligence
starring matt damon is an action movie with a story that exists only to existthe plot as i said is only there to support a well done action movie but it could have been a lot better if the movie was actually about somethingthere are no bad or good guys in the movie our main protagonist lost his mind after being shot and getting thrown into the ocean a group of fisherman saves him  gives him clothes and moneythe guy doesnt remember anything about what happened nor his namewhat he does for a livinghis family or anything at all the movie is about this guys search for his identity and the answer to all these questions on the way of finding it things doesnt go as expected  of course a lot of martial art scenesgun fightscar chases are thrown on his way which are again well done and of course a womanthe movie is well shot relies on shaky cam a lot from time to time which was my only complain other than the 100 different shooting angles in the chasing scenes sometimes you gotta keep things simple so the audience doesnt have problems understanding what is going onthe movie is also well acted i didnt have any problem believing matt damon is this pro killing machineother characters were also convincing i enjoyed this movie and its easier for me to enjoy action movies who arent about something than action movies that pretending to be about something and failing doug liman the director of leads the movie wellthe movie is unnecessary but not unskilled a,intelligence
hollywood comes up trumps with this engaging spy thriller based of course on the novel by robert ludlum its a film that serves to reinforce my belief that all hollywood thrillers shot in france are topnotch and its a film that employs all the modern stylised tricks of the camera to come up with a winning formula the story is straightforward enough an amnesic spy falls in love suffers numerous assassination attempts and is on the run from the police as he desperately tries to regain his memories matt damon taking the title role gives an engaging and likable performance and in addition proves himself worthy as a lean but powerful man of actionspeaking of action the film acquits itself well with some stunning chase sequences  the hunt in the bank is amazing and finishes off with a nicely perilous highrise scareshow theres a car chase with a mini that just about equals the ones in ronin plus the various fight sequences all employ a superfast spedup martial arts style fighting that looks pretty cool to me watch out for the bit where a ballpoint pen becomes a lethal weapon cringeworthy stuff technical qualities are excellent and to enhance things further a great supporting cast all does their best franka potente is attractive and feisty as bournes accomplice maria chris cooper is excellent as the stressedout cia man on damons trail brian cox delivers another of those catchy powerful extended cameo performances and finally clive owen steals his scenes as a tough hitman nicknamed the professoris about as good as you can get for a modern action thriller the storyline is complex but gradually revealed piece by piece so that its relatively simple to follow although it lacks the scope and extended timeframe of other recent spy thrillers such as spy game and the sum of all fears the lowkey approach to the action works nicely and the gorgeous european locations make it look refreshingly different intelligent pulsepounding and packed with intrigue and excitement  a rare treat in these modern braindead blockbuster days of cinema,intelligence
the plot of the movie is about a man trying to figure out his past after he was found floating in the ocean as he learns about himself he uses his skills to defend himself and to evade police this movie have realistic action with good acting the camera is zoomed in and shaky sometimes i liked the car chase scenes and the fight scenes with are brutal this movie is well directed and has a good plot and settings matt damon plays as jason bourne and does lots of great acting the movie has great soundtracks at the right times making the movie suspenseful and entertaining the way the movie starts is awesome and couldnt have been better the ending is not quite perfect because there more to the story overall this movie quickly became one of my favorites,intelligence
a man who is nearly shot to death gets his life saved by a fisherman he wakes with amnesia not knowing who he is he meets a troubled but kind woman marie he discovers he is a former assassin named jason bourne jason must fully figure out why hes being hunted by treadstone i think the sequels are amazing as well but the first is still the best though bourne ultimatum is a really close second this one feels raw compared to the sequels and the most passionate i wouldnt say its actionpacked but the story is very engrossing and there are some action scenes that are exhilarating there is an amazing and lengthy car chase at around the 50 minute mark which would prove to be a benchmark for the rest of the sequels i also enjoyed the fight scenes the shaky cam isnt as prominent as it is in the sequels if the ending doesnt make you smile i question your sanity another thing i enjoyed about this movie is the character development even though bourne is a stone cold killer his transition into a caring human being was really fun to watch he really is an antihero marie is a great character as well she doesnt have much in her life so why not go along for the ride she really has nothing else it was fun to watch jason and maries relationship evolve i questioned the casting choice of damon at first he didnt seem badass to me  but im happy to say he proved me wrong in a big way i really cant picture anybody else as bourne renner did fine as aaron cross in the spin off but it wasnt the same i also liked his paranoia as bourne it really added to the suspense damon is able to make you care about his plight franka potente is solid for the most part she is stonefaced during some of the most hectic moments but she comes through shes got a charm that is hard to resist her chemistry with damon is fantastic and is one of the reasons this movie worked so well chris cooper is really good as the villain his use of the word solider grated my nerves though brian cox is fine adewale akinnuoyeagbaje is kinda wasted julia stiles is easy on the eyes and good in her role clive owen shows up briefly as an assassin this is a phenomenal movie i consider the bourne trilogy to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time i own all of them and watch them at least once a year this is still the best 9310,intelligence
interesting and nonstop and still with a heart this is what doug liman does with the already fun novel by robert ludlumis about a man who is found floating on the middle of an ocean with no clue no name and no idea why he was there the plot is very interesting the lead character is great and the romance is done rightthe screenplay is very good the score is great though the action scenes tend to get a little over the top but it doesnt compromise the experience seriously the movie is very good and is worth watching it there is no way you mistake bourne with bond or hunt even if it diverges a little from ludlums novel it is still very good to stay on its own and the best part is that inspired the even better sequels but well get to that lateris worthy your time and money,intelligence
i watched this film more than once and i never get tired of it i dont know about you guys but matt damon surprised me in this film because after good wil hunting i never thought he would be in a role like this he managed to surprise all of us but that is how good he is the action was real and the supporting cast was awesome as well the thing i like about it was jason bournes use of weapons you would think were harmless i really think more action films should have realism but thats me and i like how intelligent it is matt damon has to do more bourne films because he is incredible in them i highly recommend whoever hasnt seen it should see it,intelligence
i love this movie i like the action the drama and the especially the chase scenes matt damon does a phenomenal job bringing this character to life as only he can like so many other actors in so many other roles it isnt easy to imagine someone else in those rolesi have listed favorite scenes in other movies but not all movies i have reviewed i have three scenes that i especially likethe first scene i like is when jason bourne matt damon and marie franke potente leave bournes paris apartment they are cornered and jason decides to run but he is trying to get marie to leave marie doesnt want to leave so jason brings her along for the ride and what a ride it isjason drives an austin mini cooper through the streets of paris to escape the paris police one of the best parts is when he drives the car down a set of stairs he escapes the police and does so with flare can you imagine having a high speed car chase in a mini cooper i think it is funny as hellthe next best scene is when jason confronts the professor clive owen another agent like bourne he does this with flare as well bourne blows up a large propane tank to distract the professor then bourne runs into a field and is able to shoot and wound the professor after getting little information from him bourne watches as the professor diesthe last of my favorite scenes is after bourne confronts conklin chris cooper his former boss bourne hits conklin and renders him unconscious seconds later bourne must fight his way out of the apartment building by killing four agents one agent he kills by shooting through the forehead while falling through the air and landing on the body of one of the agentsi do have some advice for those that want to read the books by robert ludlum or eric van lustbader dont read the books thinking that you will be able to follow the movies i have only ever read the first book the only similarity between the first book and the first movie is as follows the title many of the character names and jason bournes amnesia the rest of the book is completely different from the movie i have to say that that was probably as it was supposed to be since the book was released in 1980 and the movie came out 22 years lateri give this movie 10 stars out of 10,intelligence
to say that jason bourne is comparable to james bond is something of an understatement and a very underrated claim at the same time they even have the same initials by the way some might say that it is just being clichd to compare the two but in my mind it truly works where bond is suave and impressionable bourne is direct and doesnt really care what people think of him the film definitely departs from the source material but not to its discredit the film manages to transcend the genre by taking the places and names from the books and create its own original story it follows the baseline of the books but crafts a world for our main character which is plausible and modern enough to not even appear dated the performances are all topnotch as it should be the persona damon creates as bourne is by far the best role in the film i would say its absolutely one of his best roles  what one would call a tourdeforce performance however ample support is supplied from the rest of the cast also potente is especially good and even though cooper just seems really mad all the time it really is a testament to his acting abilities if one watches his other movies and understands his immense range something that only just recently came to me about these films is the diversity of the cast there is bourne who is a definite loner even when hes with marie he can never get over the changes that his experiences have forced him to make and he is therefore incredibly tortured by conflicting emotions and thoughts all the time so no matter who he interacts with the focus is always on bourne he functions in all situations the same and deals with everybody except marie more or less the same he is what he is and you either love him or hate him  no gray area then we have those who are tracking andor trying to kill him and they have their own separate part of the movie that only sometimes interacts with bourne because of all this everything is literally on damons shoulders to carry the movie and that is why he is so great just like bourne damon has to stand out if he doesnt then his role means nothing and the viewer doesnt care about what happens this is much like what happens in unknown the fairly recent liam neeson vehicle which has a very similar storyline to the bourne films the movie also fits in rather nicely with the other two and creates a viable trilogy one might say that they prefer limans directing simply due to the fact he doesnt use choppy editing like greengrass did but i understand the need for both methods in their element and could not imagine either one to be any different as with all three of the bourne films the action is astonishingly simple once one gets used to it and anyone is more than welcome to freezeframe and follow the choreography some have said that the way these films compose the action sequences is unnecessarily fast and showy i disagree the films choreography is a symbol for the character of bourne the action is literally so fast its over before you even realize much like it is from bournes side of things due to his amnesia he doesnt understand what hes doing either per se its a reflex for him to react the way he does he just does it without hesitation or remorse which is exactly why hes so good as an agent i will say that for me the franchises only disadvantage is for anyone whos never seen the films before when i first watched the films i didnt really understand it either it was all too complicated for me at the time but after watching all three of the damon films havent seen legacy yet several times once i got older i have progressively understood what is going on within each one once i understand whats going on its a piece of cake to invest myself in the story and characters but for those who are beginners like i was at one time the films probably seem horrible thats when i would say to stick with them for the long haul  watch them all again if you have to i love these films and i would strongly recommend them to anyone dont underestimate the awesomeness of bourne,intelligence
at the root of bond is something neofascistic and totally materialist  john le carre the bourne franchise stars matt damon as jason bourne a kind of antijames bond who though a secret agent trained by the cia finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against treadstone a blackops arm of the us militaryas action movies go is stronger than most the best of its franchise identity features a number of lowkey and inventive action sequences most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn bournes quick thinking unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers the opposite of bond whos always playing catch upthe films sequels the bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatum merely rehash the franchises first film emulating its running man plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences blow for blow what was once fresh quickly becomes stale and bournes ingenious battle tactics now rarely surprise still both films contain a number of subplots which arent usually found in western action movies here bourne once a state sanctioned assassin tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins elsewhere he colludes with whistleblowers and leftwing newspapers the guardian itself slowly dying in real life attempting to expose a cia which routinely engages in offthegrid criminal activities in real life theyd brazenly assassinate the leaders of or engender coups in congo morocco jamaica costa rica the dominican republic mozambique guyana etc this is a far cry from james bond goldfinger we recall opens with bond blowing up the oil supplies of latin american revolutionaries bonds the imperialists misogynistic footsoldier bournes a disillusioned grunt in an age of bradley manning jullian assange and john kiriakou which of course makes him a threat as journalist kevin gosztola observed to this day the only cia officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody bourne is himself both whistleblower and action hero a john rambo for liberals his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia to direct confrontation he attempts to expose and remember whilst the cia attempts to cover up and silence this aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers the state is the enemy and bournes a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer indeed when pitted against foreign agents bond repeatedly says my argument is not with you unlike bond a relic of the cold war bournes decidedly postcold war bonds always had a very rigid sense of selfidentity the names bond james bond bourne though doesnt remember his name his past his identity and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesnt recognise the locales our globetrotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable everywhere looks the same bournes both representative of a culture that doesnt really know what it stands for and one which cant morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identitieswhilst a liberal action film is some kind of contradiction the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc the bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things women are consistently the films moral guardians bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation water and waterboarding continual motifs in the franchise led to the very creation of bourne and bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with what represents me and by extension america while bonds your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown country and offshore escapades the bourne franchise ultimately deals with bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption he chose to be jason bourne he is culpableno surprise then that doug liman who directed identity has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the irancontra affair and paul greengrass director of supremacy and ultimatum is himself a leftleaning cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmakerthe most interesting of the franchise the bourne legacy was released in 2012 it starred jeremy renner as aaron cross another blackops cia agent the film again rehashes the bourne formula  cross is pursued by the cia who again want him silenced  but also does a number of interesting new things its explicitly concerned for example with issues of collusion and participation how can organisms like bourne and bond exist if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society in legacys case cross maps a network of globespanning factory workers scientists politicians engineers all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal cia project fascism then depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity ignorance compartmentalisation collusion separation disavowal and outright secrecy when the cia project  operation outcome  is exposed it then quickly evaporates like shadow exposed to light members are hunted down agents are suicided and scientists are reassigned or murdered such murders recall countless historical events regimes from ancient rome to even 21st century democratic states tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposureas an action movie legacy is weak a stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour the film contains sequences involving predator drones now the weapon of choice for the us military when it comes to naked war crimes recent legislation essentially makes it legal for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipsofacto reclassified as terrorists insurgents or as has happened several times simply animals dogs or cows of course bourne and bond are themselves drones but while bourne wants escape bonds the kind of guy sent to silence him8510  worth one viewing,intelligence
is a taut solid thriller that doesnt have to rely on explosive over the top action and bondian gadgetry matt damon does a fine job defining the character of jason bourne an amnesiac slowly reconfiguring his life as an assassin in the employ of the american government i particularly enjoyed his martial arts scenes though im wondering how much of that was damon versus a standin franka potente was believable as marie thrust into a situation that at a certain point allows for no return the intrigue mystery action and chase scenes all blend together in a successful adventure that keeps one guessing although the revelation of why bourne failed to kill wombosi brought the story down a notch from for me a professional assassin wouldnt let feelings get in the way of doing the job another distraction was brian cox in the role of abbott i kept wondering how he could possibly look so much like marlon brando,intelligence
matt damon plays a skilled assassin with amnesia after getting shot twice in the on the back on a mission he meets a girl called marie franka potenete and after it is a huge cat and mouse chase through out the whole film okay as some of you may be aware bourne identity is the first of a collection of books by robert ludlum and bourne identity the film and bourne identity the book are two completely different things it does not strictly follow the book so if you want to watch this film and look at it as an adaptation then your going to be disappoint it but if you look at it as a film on its own it is fantastic it truly is i am glad that matt damon played the part because if it was someone like tom cruise excluding his amazing performance in collateral it would be different not bad but different and it would not suit the intensity of the film i was also impressed by franka potente as well clive owen also stars in this film and does not say really say anything but when he says his lines it is what very emotive very powerful as well overall the awesome fight scenes the brilliant acting the fantastic script genius directing and one of the best chase scenes ever this is what action films should be like the start of a legendary trilogy,intelligence

i will admit up front that i watched this movie expecting an action flick there i said it so complain all you want about how people these days have ridiculously short attention spans  yes i am not beyond turning my brain off for an hour or two in order to enjoy a moviehowever i also enjoy watching movies that are original or thought provoking or character driven or plotcentered while was plotcentered it certainly wasnt the other three it was a failure as both a deep movie and a brainless action flickthere were no exciting special effects few explosions and few fight sequences  all of which could be forgiven easily if the characters were even remotely interesting ive never seen a matt damon movie before and his performance here didnt make me want to go out and see more of him because we know basically from the beginning what happened to him based on the scenes with the cia agents i didnt care at all about his character either franka potente was all right i suppose but marie wasnt written in a way that made me care about her either i rolled my eyes at the obligatory kissss meeee scene i knew it was going to happen eventually but it was so drawn out and lacking in chemistryand also  just when it starts to get interesting when he finds out hes a government project or whatever  it just ends after all that pointless running around and hiding and marie just go this life isnt good for you we dont even delve into what probably would have been the most interesting aspect of the storyline i suppose in the sequels we learn more about whatever it is they did to him to make him a superspy but i dont care enough to find out i only sat through this movie because i was watching it with other people otherwise i would have turned it off long before it reached its end,intelligence
a wounded man is pulled out of the sea by fishermen who help him recuperate but he suffers from amnesia and doesnt know why people are trying to kill him the first in a series of films based on ludlum novels is slick but silly the pickles that bourne gets out of are more ludicrous than a james bond film the silly stunts would be fun if like bond the film didnt take itself so seriously but this a humorless affair damon is rather onedimensional as the hero the quirky camera work that worked well for director liman in go his enjoyable 1999 comedy is not suited to this drab endeavor whats more it rambles on too long,intelligence
this has long been one of my favorite spy movies i liked it so much in fact that i read the book i wish i didnt read the book however because the movie has barely anything in common with it whoever wrote the script just stole the main characters name and the fact that he had amnesia and went on to write his own story from there it uses vague references to the book but thats it this movie should never have been titled if it wasnt id respect it a lot more they even went as far as to rename the leading female role why bother i dont understand why hollywood always has to rip off good stories tell it like it was or call it something else the book is a very good read and has a much more thought out plot i would love to see the real story adapted to the big screen one day,intelligence
is a pure and straightforward action thriller with solid writing and acting no more no less it is superior to most films that fall in this genre because it manages to stay away from most of the wornout action clichs while focusing more on characterplot development and exposition than the action sequencesdoug liman and tony gilroy have created a fresh action thriller with one that will entertain many viewers without feeling stale or overstaying its welcome the acting is pretty topnotch with matt damons emotionless and laidback approach to his character a welcome one in a genre dominated by overacting or poor acting chris cooper and franka potente play their supporting roles well and potente adds a nice contrast to damons bourne clive owen has a brief cameo that is worth mentioningso what about the action well there is an obligatory car chase that gets a bit old after the first two or three minutes or so frankly i dont see why these pointless scenes have become a requisite for the genre this chase adds nothing that viewers havent seen before and didnt really have to be that long the fight sequences are worth watching and many of them involve some sleek handtohand combat which are thankfully welledited and choreographed but the real selling point is not the action but the screenplay as written by tony gilroy which keeps the more intellectual viewers on edge trying to figure out bournes identity the exposition is wellwritten and doesnt come out of the blue again top marks for writing something that is usually absent in action thrillersthe editing is crisp and clean making the moviegoing experience worthwhile i decided to mention this because most action movies have dreadful editing to the point where the action sequences seem blurry and nauseating the music in this film is also worth mentioning as it contains a modern upbeat feel that suits the movie wella final note about jason bournes past it is worth noting that screenplays that encourage viewers to root for a character with a shady pastpresent are usually frowned upon by many upstanding citizens i bring to mind the recent controversy surrounding the popularity of showtimes dexter series i was impressed by gilroys ability to write the past bourne as different from the present bourne due to the amnesia it should at lest keep these concerned folks quietall in all a great film thats right i am no fan of action thrillers but this one is miles ahead of the ordinary it is intelligent and wellpaced and will give viewers exactly what they expect and more deserves a solid 710 and 3 stars out of 4,intelligence
has been hyped by many people as the ultimate spy film outbonding bond etc etc to a certain extent that is true  it was exciting broadly plausible and full of action on the other hand for a start it wasnt exactly a spy film bourne starts off not knowing who he is he is chased around a lot and nearly gets killed a few times and he ends up still not really knowing who he is he doesnt do any spying he just realises slowly over the course of the film that he is himself a sort of spythe plot was barely recognisable from the book apart from a few names the chase from zurich to paris and the fact that people were trying to kill him the reason why they were trying to kill him and the people responsible were new and the cia involvement was never fully explained or developed perhaps this was a good thing as the book is i think overly complicated but they could have kept some sort of linkin terms of plausibility some of the fighting looked like something out of the matrix maybe genuine but filmed to make it look like it was a bit superhero and the part where he jumps down a 4storey stairwell using a dead body to cushion his fall was frankly laughableas it is i still enjoyed it and agree it is a great improvement on most bond films  as witnessed by the way that bond was reinvented for casino royale the lack of plot carryover also means that i can watch the bourne supremacy when its on tv next week without worrying that i am still only 12 way through the book,intelligence
this is by far the best spy film ever made it is very realistic with their display of realistic tradecraft and real gadgets i enjoy the bond films but i fell they are nothing in comparison to or the bourne movies that followed i definitely found it to be a much anticipated change from the modern clichs often put out by the bond filmsi greatly enjoyed the fight scenes throughout the movie for their short and snappy appearance which is much more like a real fight all of bournes gadgets are real and can be bought by anyone so i think it makes it all the better in the bond films he relied greatly on gadgets and gizmos and the films where all around very fictionalized and pale in comparison to the bourne movies,intelligence

much like another persons comments i heard good things about it when it was on the cinema but didnt go and see it that was a mistakeby far this is a magnificent spythriller matt damon can be slightly hit and miss on occasion but was perfectly cast as was the german chic who played marie his companion she was terrificthe story has a good level of detail and complexity without getting too bogged down in itself  a common problem for many recent us films in this genrethere was more realism in this film as well the hero was not invincible he was injured at several points and his battle scars didnt magically disappear two minutes later on a more subtle level i noticed that the weather was terrible the whole way through it was overcast snowing wet you name it just about anything other than sunny for some reason i liked that a lot it gave a good atmosphere and realism to the film and gave us a break from all other actions films shot in europe under perfect sunny weather small point big difference also i liked the fact that they didnt go overboard with product placement unless mini approached them to promote a car they made in the late 70sthe lack of gadgetry was fine by me leave that to bond bourne is more realistic and doesnt need the ability to fire a missile out of his wrist watch to get himself out of a fix in fact youll notice throughout the film that if he acquires someone elses gun he gets rid of it relatively quickly again more realisticthe supporting cast were great without being too over stated chris cooper probably overacted his part to some degree but that was not a major sticking pointall in all a very well made spy film with a good balance between action and plotfor those who like a bit of cinema trivia the car chase scene in paris was shot several months after the film was finished the producer and director were not happy with the car chase scene in the original cut so they went back to paris with key cast members and filmed it again see if you can spot whether changes hair length changes and so on during that scenefollowed by a sequel that didnt quite reach the same heights but was good nonetheless and im looking forward to ultimatum,intelligence
the first time a watched this movie i was so surprised the fighting scenes the driving the locations it was glamorous but not in a james bond way this type of spy movie seemed more palatable and real i mean did you ever see bond disable people that efficiently and isnt that what spies and special ops agents are supposed to do so i was hooked even the old standby of amnesia was played out well it was great to watch bournes superiors freak out about disassociative amnesia and their superspy shortcircuiting i also liked the fact that you never fully trusted anyone in this movie that made for great tension in the end i wanted to go right out and get my own sigarms 550 223 sniper rifle but it costs 15000 and that my friends is why we have movies,intelligence
you remember im sure how john rambo was a practically superhuman expert at surviving and killing in the forest and he was hunted by a horde of illmotivated nincompoops and outwitted all of them in the mountains of washington well is like that except that its setting is urban and its a far less stupid movie its an action move alright but not a stupid one you can tell its an action movie because there is a speedy car chase through the streets of paris and because the hero can cause a fuel tank to explode simply by shooting at it with a shotgun you can tell its not stereotypical because there are a number of physical fights in which one or another participants pistol is knocked out of his hand  and in no case is there a shot of the gun skittering along the floor and neither does the hero bump his head against an adversarys head in defiance of newtons third law jason bourne matt damon is hauled out of the sea with a bullet wound and amnesia he spends the movie along with the girl friend he acquires potente trying to find out who he is a born identity so to speak meanwhile hes being hunted in the most thorough and hightech sort of way by the cia who was to whack him for having failed to complete a hit theyre afraid hell spill the beans you see and of course the police are after him too for various infractions committed in the course of his questi quite liked the movie the atmosphere of wintry switzerland and paris are nicely set up whew it looks cold the performances are fine especially the two leads and chris cooper at the cia honcho oh i suppose we can all have doubts that the cia are quite so good at what they do but this story is fictionalthe action scenes mostly mano a mano dont drag on they happen suddenly and are lightningfast the script is literate in the sense that people do and say things that are believable potentas voice is especially neat to listen to her germantinted sarcasm is perfectly believablematt damon well he looks perhaps a bit like a expreppy whose most violent endeavors involved a tennis ball but his performance is fine as it usually is and although chris coopers part isnt overly large i think its one of his best roles he has an amazing range considering what he brings with him  from efficiently slimy here to gentle and sensitive in something like lone star and though the plot is propelled by a set of less than plausible propositions compare it to rambo in which everything hinges on the revenge motive if thats what it is of one big hulking brute of an irritable sheriffits a wellcrafted action movie with no great ethical moral embedded in it i hope not anyway if there were a message it would have to be something like who are we really thats pretty banal unless its treated as an absurdity as in georg buchners woyzeck in which when the hero becomes conscious he asks something like who am i where am i why am i im not sure why on the dvd the director keeps drawing our attention to the realism of the script while at one point he tells us that nobody was shown smoking in the movie because he didnt want to provide bad role models for kids even though the entire french crew had gauloise stubs glued to their lips what price political correctnesstechnically i suppose this is what id call a latent status movie in which the hero has the status of a highly skilled craftsman but doesnt reveal it until circumstances force him to shanes latent status was that of a skilled gunslinger richard kimballs was that of a doctor this is a higherorder latent status movie in that not only do his friends not know of bournes secret identity as a superb assassin but bourne has amnesia and doesnt know it himself suppose though bournes secret identity turned out to be that of manager of a sonic drivethru in amarillo or somethingthis has nothing to do with the movie but there is a directors audio commentary on the dvd i do wish directors would do more than tell us which scenes were shot on location and which on a sound stage and stop telling us how incredible everyone was on the set why not point out goofs weaknesses and conflicts as well theyre equally interestingi recommend it and i recommend taking a second look at franka potente a young german woman whose appearance would not pass muster next to brittny spears or jessica alba but who has an inner beauty as well as a hell of a lot more talent than most of todays tabloid heroines she does have one major flaw  her name i keep getting it mixed up with famke janssen and battleship potemkin and mandy potamkin and frankie sinatra and the name of a chevrolet dealership in new jersey shell have to change it,intelligence
is one of the few great modern action moviesit stars matt damon as jason bourne a man with amnesia and does not even know his own name on his quest to find his identity the cia send assassins to kill him why well watch it and find outis the greatest action movie since braveheart it has some e action scenes some high speed car chases and much much more it also has some great performances from brian cox julia stiles and clive owenwatch this movie if you are looking for a rollercoaster ride of action packed fun 1010,intelligence
besides the obvious facts that matt damon did more than justice to jason bourne and that franka potente and matt looked really good together all i can say is that the movie must have left ludlum proud of his workalthough the movie tends to sway a little from the book the changes werent drastic and at times helped to get the story rolling everything from the time jason is picked up from the mediterranean till the time he realizes why he was there in the first place is very well laid out and who could have thought that clive owen the main guy from inside man would be  the professor another assassin one of my favourite scenes was when the swiss police tried to take jason to the police station when he was sleeping on the bench the cop tried to hit him with his nightstick but jason got hold of it and a couple of seconds later the cops were the ones who were out cold literally thank you for the awesome movie doug liman and of course thank you mrludlum,intelligence
 the bourne supremacy as a strategy consultant  whenever i go to the movies or watch movies at home i often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life survival skills to participants in my seminars  workshopsthe two bourne movies namely bourne identity  bourne supremacy are two great examplesboth movies are loosely based on robert ludlums work which included the rheinmann exchange the osterman weekend  the holcroft covenant they have also been made into great moviesin the first movie with the opening scene an unconscious young man is pulled out off the mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night thinking that the young man is dead a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back  a microchip in his hip the chip reveals a swiss bank account but our wet hero isnt dead but realises that he has amnesia he then rushes to zurich in the bank vault he discovers his name jason bourne played by mark damon in addition he finds a baffling pile of different passports all with his picture and a large chunk of cash in the us embassy he bumps into marie played by franka potente along with the fact that someone wants to kill him armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills  with marie by his side he scours paris for clues about his identity and past life finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots one assassin was played by clive owen as the professor masterminded by rouge elements of the ciain the second movie with the opening scene continuing from the first movie jason bourne is recovering in goa india with marie he spots a mysterious darkglassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging he escapes with marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase the next scene shows cia operatives under deputy director pamela landy joan allen conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in cia but something goes wrong her subsequent investigation leads to the highlyclassified treadstone project which apparently involves jason bourne she even finds evidence that bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation so bourne sets out to clear his name the remaining part of the movie shows bourne outsmarting cia operatives   the assassin played menacingly by karl urban as kirill   tracking down the rogue elements in the cia with shady connections to the russian mob who have jointly framed him in the first placein the two movies jason bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe  pay attention to whats around him  note notice the exceptions in the details of the environment  which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators  at the same time stay agile mentally  physically to anticipate dangers  get out of precarious situationsfor exampleremember the scene in the second movieafter he had jogged at the beach he observed a darkglassed man whose clothing  behaviour somehow did not match the environmenthis ability to stay calm size up dangerous situations  come up with superquick innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both moviesfor exampleremember the scene in the first movie where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircasethe scene in the second movie where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers  an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gasfilled roomwow that was great naturally i am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie car chases cat  mouse games etc in both moviesadditionally what i like about both movies is the total absence of superduper gadgets commonly found in such spythriller movies jason bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity  creativity to outsmart his enemiesto end my review i must add that i have enjoyed watching both movies experientially as well as educationally,intelligence
difficult to know were to start  so will simply say this is one of the top 10 movies of the last decade the bourne movies have taken an exciting new road  we now have james bond without the clichd gorgeous girls ridiculous gadgets and tiresome one liners now steady despite what ive said i really like bond you know what your going to get and theyre flashy fun flics  never miss them but if those movies ever grew up youd hope theyd turn out like bourne is tougher more real the action sequences are brilliant and tough as nails there plot is solid information is drip fed at the right rate and you can never say for sure how things will turn out  which is absolutely essential and separates the simply good movies from the great there are a small number of well developed characters and again its nice to see that you can do whats been done with bourne without a couple of huge hollywood names battering the movies path to financial success oh and the soundtrack is fantastic opening scene is class too,intelligence
this movie has an intenselygripping story with excellent action sequences and a solid and intelligent plot line the genius cinematography sets the mood for the movie cold and dark at first which to me represents bournes state of mind when we are introduced to him at the end we see him in a beautiful sunny mediterranean sea setting which signifies that he has gained some illumination into who he is the character development is superb and the action is almost believable compared with the razzledazzle of typical hollywood productions these days the storyline is strong enough that a ton of special effects are unnecessary the way a movie should be in my humble opinion best of all we can actually like matt damon for a change because he effectively portrays a character we can empathize with the character is an action hero without any of the clichs we typically associate with action heroes  no moronic 1liners and no cheesy muscle posesthe bourne character has a workmanlike approach to dangerous situations and seems as relieved as we are to get through a tough scrape damon obviously puts a lot of work into making the handtohand combat sequences believable and reportedly does most of his own stunts for this filmthe soundtrack is firstrate and perfectly compliments the cinematography to help create the mood of the movie if you watch this movie and do not rate it at least a 9 watch it again and compare it with everything else out there being offered on the big screen that isnt worth the 2 hours of your life,intelligence
one of my alltime favourite movies and a role damon looks like he was born to play pun intended this has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning keeps your mind racing and your heart beating its refreshing thrilling gripping its beautifully shot and directed damon and potente are superb together there is nothing i can criticize about this movie  even the sudden blast of extreme ways by moby at the end makes the hairs on the back of your neck tinglethis is one of those movies that as soon as the end credits roll but after the song ends you just want to watch it again it doesnt matter that you know the plot its like a pint of your favourite beer or a chocolate fudge icecream combined with your favourite fairground ride and catchiest song not at the same time else youd be sick very moreish very entertaining faultless 1010,intelligence
some say this movie is complicated actually its rather simple a 30000000 dollar weapon named jason bourne fails a mission to kill this politically powerful african guy named wambosi jason gets caught on wambosis boat gets shot twice in the back and falls over in the water the results of his injuries is amnesia he wakes up on a fishing boat and thus the story goes on the agency he is working codenamed treadstone realizes that they cant have jason loose on the field so they try and kill him jason bourne isnt like james bond to quote paul greengrass he doesnt rely on some izzy wizzy gadget to help him he relies on surreal intelligence and talent jason can easily come up with a plan to get out of trouble in seconds and execute it to perfection i have to say and the bourne supremacy are the best movies i have ever seen and both feature superb performances by matt damon the fight sequences are extraordinary and theres a lot of drama to go in with all of the action and supremacy are my two favorite moves of all time and both are defidentially worth seeing,intelligence
doug limans bourne identity is a great suspense flick i like these kind of movies along the lines of james bond scenarios damon is perfect in the lead as jason bourne an assassin who loses his memory and questions who he is franka potente was good in the female lead he meets and befriends chris cooper clive owen and brian cox were all great in supporting roles this film is directed well by liman who directed great films up until mr and mrs smith this film is directed realistically unlike the one with pitt and jolie i liked the screenplay too it wasnt to artsy for the genre suited well this movie was very entertaining 910,intelligence
when i went to this movie i had read the book and was expecting something similar in plot the first twenty or thirty minutes are great i couldnt have made them better myself then it goes off and doesnt even include the main enemy of bourne from the book thats like filming the lord of the rings and making denethor the main antagonist instead of sauron this movie was a wasted opportunity for greatness why would a director make a movie and throw away the very plot that made the plot worthy of filming this is what is wrong with hollywood they fear new things in the film industry and whenever possible they twist these new ideas into the same rubbish theyve been spewing for decades they took a plot full of intrigue and suspense and made it into the average action movie with the merest hint of a twist to make it a little different,intelligence
after recently viewing and reviewing i find to be one of the finest examples of the actionthriller genre there are many scenes where no dialog occurs and the visual imagery is allowed to tell the story first aboard ship having bullets and capsule removed escape from us embassy safe deposit box discovery apt in paris showdown at country house  i think this and the next in the series the bourne supremacy are better bond films then any bond film the action romance and intrigue are all there just without the smarmy grin of silliness just exceptional film making in the genre that often doesnt take the time to do it well,intelligence
firstly credit where credit is dueits a good movie having said that i hate it when they take a literary character and ride on his coat tails of success if you are going to call a movie by the same name as a novel then dont stray from the overall plot or kill off characters who are supposed to live or save characters who are supposed to die i understand and accept that books dont always translate well into movies thats okay just dont go changing the whole story either this movie begins right same as the book but the thing that i really hate is that it takes characters who are sympathetic in the book and turns them into irrational evil doers there is no good reason to change them that way give the audience a little credit for intelligence and add a scene explaining why they are really chasing bourne while im at it bourne supremacy takes my complaint to even greater lengths,intelligence

this movie is simply excellent its filled with action which related to other movies is realistic beyond comparison the psychological phenomenon of amnesia just adds an adequate bit of mystery to the plot during the first part of the filmthe movie has an ingenious plot with a failed assassination that the cia has to prevent from leaking out by all means necessary at risk of political turmoil and possibly a great loss off credibility and good reputation for the organization bourne is of course a great risk both because of his severe memory loss and that he mysteriously failed to complete the mission those upholding that the movie doesnt have a plot must be incredibly stupid my advise to you is to stick with bond or indiana jones where you havent got to do the slightest bit of thinking yourselves,intelligence
when i first heard about this film i thought matt damons in this yeah right as if hell be any good but damon actually won me over with a believable performance as your friendly spy with amnesia jason bourne bourne is hauled out of the sea with bullets in him and no knowledge of who he is or what he has done with the help of marie potente bourne slowly starts to discover his identity and purpose all the while being chased by assassins and spies all over europe the film boasts realistic fight scenes nailbiting action sequences and great locations across europe the whole film in my opinion had a sense of realism about it i mean imagine if you couldnt remember who you were but could fight shoot and drive like a maniac what would you do if you were being hunted and had no idea why all up an enjoyable action flick and not a bad way to kill a couple of hours,intelligence
we are well into the new century we need a new hero jason bourne is that man i will assume you have seen the film and not bore you with a useless summary matt damon and franka potente are well cast and spark off each other nicely the action is well handled and credible the camera work is also deft and accomplished i have read many of the other reviews on this site my advice is to avoid them many are obviously written by embryonic film makers or wannabe film reviewers this is a good film which proves that hollywod in spite of all its failings can still turn out a highly entertaining film i cant wait to see the bourne ultimatum and heres a big yahboo to all the naysayers,intelligence
actionpacked movie from start to finish matt damon excellently portrays the confusion in the mind of bourne the fight scenes are brilliant and although the hero is capable of extraordinary physical feats he avoids the macho or terminatorlike attitude we are accustomed to special credit must be given to the scriptwriters as the dialogs are exemplary no overdose short poignant sentences contribute to the tension some breathtaking pursuits in the streets of paris that can be compared to those in ronin and do not last too long the principal merit of this movie is that the viewer senses a lot of hard work has gone into the preparation and production it succeeds in balancing a good story action and a plausible ending a word of praise for the leading lady alsoapparently she did not want to steal the show and granted matt damon the credit for his outstanding performance,intelligence
like the previous reviewer i am currently studying psychology and i would like to thank him for setting the record straight not only does amnesia exist but it is very plausible in the situation presented in this film briefly a review its on usa network behind me right now and i have to say i cant bring myself to turn it off it is a great spy thrilleractionadventure with a noirish feel that adds to the realism if bournes plight like dr kimble in the fugitive bourne must evade the powers that be whilst finding the truth to his past a basic plot outline that never seems to fail the action is good the story is quality and i cant think of any reason not to recommend this film be ready to think though if you decide to watch the sequel its a doozy,intelligence
having never read any of the books by robert ludlum the bourne series was entirely new to me identity is the first of three films the bourne supremacy has also been released just last year with a third coming next year and shows that there is life within the actionthriller genrejames bond and subsequent spy related films have become very predictable but is not starting off with jason bourne matt damon salvaged off the french shores by fishermen the film gives the audience a disorientated feel as our own hero comes to grips with his amnesiathis is one of the key points to the film like bourne the audience is learning about his history following clues and getting mixed up with government conspiracy it is from this plateaux that the film is able to deliver great action photography direction acting matt damon is excellent and a car chase worthy of any of the 70s cop filmsnotable members of the cast include chris cooper for me is one of americas most outstanding actors brian cox and clive owenoverall an exciting film to watch for both film lovers and analysts,intelligence
my definition of a cinematic idiot is anyone who found the matrix confusing if you are not one of those people i strongly suggest you see the bourne supremacy without seeing this first i did and im really really happy about it identity is extremely mediocre stuff whereas the sequel is an instant classic if you are a sharp moviegoer youll get all the background information you need from the skillful and very clever use of flashbacks in supremacy it has a better story better acting better music better locations and much better action supremacy also has a fresh unique and genuinely thrilling visual style while this is exactly like a hundred maybe a thousand other films and tv shows the bourne supremacy is essential this movie is completely unnecessary,intelligence
i love this movie so much i think it is one of the greatest movies out there i really cant see anyone not liking it unless you dont like adventure suspense and great fun i suggest that anyone who has a great love of adventure watch this movie or if anyone needs some adventure in their life this is the movie to fill that void matt damon in this movie does a excellent job acting he is a very gifted actor he is also very good looking in this movie so hot this movie will definitely keep you on the very edge of your seat i suggest at least renting and watching it for at least 30 minutes and if you dont like stop watching it and take it make the movie rental place and get a movie that suits you better i bet you wont even have to do that i guarantee you will love this movie if you like bourne identity i suggest seeing bourne supremacy i bet you will love that movie also,intelligence
i was really surprised by how good and smart this movie its been a long time that ive seen a movie that actually had a good plotfirst of all i love matt and franka in this they both seem so antiaction heroish meaning that they are not your typical action figures yet that is the reason that they both come off as actual people with vulnerabilities which both make them so enduring this movie explores the underground dealings and killings of politics bourne is the one who actually does the assassins however it catches up with him psychologically and he then has amnesia emotionally he is so confused yet that survival instinct and skill still remains with him he is obviously very smart and is made to be this assassin because he is very good in fact as was revealed he initiated the assassination for treadstonethen comes marie who is this confident woman who is confident and an equal to jason it was so great that she was the one who initiated sex to jason in fact shes the comic relief in this movie which makes you kind of actually breath because this movie is intense the chemistry between both of them and the story this movie is pretty much perfect,intelligence
okay this was a good spy movie of the traditional kind but still up to date and the sequel is even better and a bit more true to the books and if i never read the books i would give them a vote of 6 for the first one and 7 for the second the books therein lay my problem with the bourne movies almost nothing from the books have made it into the movies and what little there is they have messed around with until it is almost unrecognizable it is a great shame and a travesty to the genius works of robert ludlum if he were alive today he would have been steaming mad i wish for once they would make a movie that did justice to the bourne books that would have been the father of all action dramas but if you never read the books these movies are well worth watching this is surprisingly enough much thanks to really good acting from matt damon i have never really liked damon as an actor he never seem to be able to connect with his character but in the bourne movies he for the first time really impresses me especially in the second movie where he simply is jason bourne,intelligence
superslick and supercool spy flick has secret cia assassin matt damon recovering from amnesia after being pulled unconscious from the mediterranean sea damon learns of his past slowly from contents in a swiss bank account and european beauty franka potente also gets involved in a stunning game of international espionage and a near unending contest of cat and mouse for the aforementioned duo and shady americans led by bigwigs brian cox and chris cooper damon and potente become the targets themselves of a group of cloak and dagger cia assassins led by the quiet and calculating clive owen the killers chasing damon were trained just as he was so the suspense and action hits a fevered pitch damons bout of conscience when he was assigned to assassinate african diplomat adewale akinnuoyeagbaje ends up being that quick turn of the coin that has forever altered history the system and all those within the films chaotic landscape wonderful pacing a smashing soundtrack and topflight performances from all involved make one of the neatest and most exhilarating films of the past few years outstanding upside overshadows the small problems found within 4 stars out of 5,intelligence
when i first saw this film advertised i wasnt sure matt damon could pull off an action hero but he did with a big bang we thoroughly enjoyed this movie as we have action films with mel gibson arnold s harrison ford and matt did as good a job as they have he could be the next 007 the action was almost nonstop but with a good believable story line am excited about the next chapter in this series chris cooper played a believable bad guy just spooky enough to give you the creeps the scenery was beautiful in europe the best sequence was the driving one in the little red car going down the steps evading the police it seems to me that matt damon has grown as an actor or maybe because he is a little older too the woman in the movie who played his love interest was very good too hope that she is in the next one,intelligence
this movie is nothing short of fantastic it moves fast the characters are intelligent and believable and it keeps you guessing if you havent read the booksdamon is excellent and believable in the role to the extent that a role about a super government agent is believable the pacing is excellent indeed it is so fast that the viewer starts to feel the sense of being thrown in a whirlwind where they like the characters in the movie dont really know when or where it is going to end the reason why the movie moves so quickly is because the lead characters are constantly confronted with obstacles that they barely get by before they are thrown another obstacle courtesy of the cia perhaps the james bond folks should take a few notes to improve their franchisethe action is great the fight scenes are fun and unique they are unique in that you get the sense of bournes lethal abilities without having to watch a traditional kung fu fight the director achieves this by showing the fight slow motion but occasionally sped up greatly to give the general effect of very violent fights the fight in paris was one of the best most original fight scenes ive seen in some time it is only unfortunate it wasnt followed up in the next moviefranka potente is also excellent in her limited role as the civilian caught up in this international intrigue although she is pretty much limited to the straight woman for all the wildly dangerous things that are happening to her and damon she gives her best to the role this woman can really act so if you like her in bourne check her out in run lola run and the princess and the warrior the subtitles are worth it chris cooper had fun with his role as wellall in all the movie is like a pleasant roller coaster ride it moves quickly has its twists and turns and leaves you breathless and wanting more,intelligence
this movie receives a ten mostly because it has two of hollywoods best actors in them franka potente and matt damon are real she is great she matches the character she mastered that role she played it with wit also because he is equally great they both glue you to the screen and draw you in their on screen chemistry is amazing franka potente and matt damon are a very powerful couple together of course both movies identity and supremacyand both stories are great and with these awesome actors they were well excellent thank you also to the people who cast franka over any other hollywood starlet besides being new and fresh she also was lola in run lola run another incredibly performance of her i wish to see her in many more american movies to come and as for matt damon love hearing him speak german ps one of the most breath taking onscreen kisses to date the scene were they first kiss after he gives her the make over it was stunning,intelligence
i really enjoyed this movie it took a common subject espionage and put a twist on it i didnt think that id be a matt damon fan but was for this movie i look forward to seeing the next installment i didnt feel that there were any slow moments in the story line some of the action did seem a little predicable i havent read the books so i cant say how close they are to the story line i do think that this series is capable of producing more than one sequel and i hope that it is done in a professional non dragging manner i encourage you to see the movie and hope that it is a positive experience for you too i know that i will keep watching,intelligence
i saw this after seeing bourne supremacy a man whos been shot in the back three times is found floating off the coast of france damon he soon discovers that his name is jason bourne and is some kind of superspy the first movie is not better than the sequel but it is different in tone theres more of a feeling here of lightness even amiability and the source of that is i think damons performance he is much better here than he was in supremacy mainly because theres a more natural blending of his natural sort of boyish charm and the action damon often gives the sense that he doesnt understand how hes doing what hes doing and that seems right for him a natural fit we also have the addition of a female here potente and their relationship inevitably helps soften the mood the story is not as sharp as it was in supremacy which is actually an extremely wellwritten version of the breed as bourne begins to unravel the mystery of his past treadstone sends operatives out to kill him much of the action is bourne knocking them down one by one until he knocks down clive owen who gives him enough information to finally advance the plot to the climax its entertaining dont get me wrong but doesnt have the sense of inevitability that a great genre plot shouldthe action is superior whatever greengrass gained by the extensive handheld work in supremacy immediacy mostly he lost with incoherence the director here takes a much more restrained approach and thats welcome the paris chase scene is better than the climactic moscow chase scene in supremacy in particular partly because we have a better sense of whats going on i also think the final damonowen fight  the best sequence in the film in my opinion  is aided by relatively static shots identity is lighter more of a popcorn movie than the rather sad supremacy both are worth seeing with chris cooper and brian cox both basically doing themselves as badguy agency officials,intelligence
bourne identity is a movie that seemingly should be placed in the category of the summer international espionage movie  a la xxx jack ryan and the grandfather of them all bond is bringing something else  basically its trying to hybrid character development and plot movement with the action genre i dont know if it can be called a character piece or a plot piece  its about a spy with amnesia but what it does do is make smart choices old film choices and the characters become fullyembodied  its a film that stares at you rather than winks at you its pulled off because liman director  gilroy writer make some ultrasmart choices limited use of gun play using a very artistic and efficient fighting style called kali and the downplay of any action scene with reality elements people do get injured things that are blown up are still on fire a scene later nobody takes 6 in the chest and keeps on ticking and the quite surprising performance by matt damon he plays this character straight and controlled and the character is all the better for it if anything the performance boiled down to what he didnt do and his discipline really makes the characterthe same can be said for marie who book fans will remember as the canadian economist played by franka potente potente has an uncanny ability for making characters whose very nature seem preposterous seem very real most evidently done in the princess  the warrior shes a largely ignored talent which i would imagine comes from the fact that she prefers quiet downplayed performances method performances over the look at me quality that most other women in her field choose youre not going to see this movie to see how spies deal with amnesia and how that relates to humanity as a whole youre not really going to learn anything about yourself in the movie but you wont be disappointed  its a movie that recalls the golden years of actual location shoots no effects quality acting and chemistry where movement of the camera meant something and where you dont smack your hand against your head with every clich action man line its one of the first films in recent years that hasnt made entertaining and stupid synonymous,intelligence
apparently quite a few people like this movie but i sure cant figure out why this is one of those flicks in which the director seems to have outsmarted himself there are plot elements that simply dont get filled in which seems to be the latest crazeexcuse for not knowing how to effectively wrap up a story without letting it become too contrived perhaps it would have been better had i read the book but then thats never worked for me everthis film is emblematic of the biggest problem with films today all the various parts are extremely well polished cinematography acting site location special effects but perhaps too much so the cleanliness that results if often emotionless too sterile for life you wind up feeling like its an industrial video youre watching not a motion picturethis flick despite the action scenes just bored me senseless there are many better movies dont watch this one,intelligence
i was really enjoying this movie i was into it groovinthen it happeneddo you really expect me to believe that with the cia on him and spies up his a the jason bourne can pencil bang the german into his agendai think noti dont know why hollywood feels pressured to include love or sex in every single movie cant there be an action movie just about actionoy veywell i left it half way because it upset me so i never do that i find it somewhat of a sin to walk out of a movie but i didthe fact that theyre making a part two sickens me,intelligence
i have read some of the comments and i agree with twassel and alex v that the movie was confusing and had no heart i sat through it because the action was pretty good and i was hoping that it would redeem itself by the end i had heard so many good things about it which is the reason why i sat through the whole thing the paris scenes were really nice though i got a feel of actually being in paris for a few fleeting moments but i just kept wondering why are they trying to kill him he didnt do his job ok and they didnt want him to go back and try to kill the african leader again so they wanted him dead if so why did they kill the african leader anyway ok did they want his head for the african leader so he wouldnt write his tellall book the african leader didnt ask for that he just asked for money and wanted to rule his country again and why did the girl stay with bourne there seemed to be no motivation there after they both knew he was a killer why in the heck would she want to stay with him they didnt convince us enough that she loved him why would he want to put her in that much danger they shouldve parted long before they put her friend and the two children in danger well the action kept it going because damon was really kicking butt but the plot was very weak,intelligence
i passed on this film in the theater but have since seen it several times on cable  it is very wellpaced and there are no unnecessary scenes unlike many of the other people who said there was no chemistry between damon and potente i think the two of them worked because they were able to keep the focus on the plot  the paris setting is great and they used it to full advantage it wasnt merely the careening down narrow city streets stuff it included some truly french settings such as bournes apartment building which was fabulous watch it will turn out that this was filmed in pittsburghit was nice to see clive owen in a small but pivotal role as an assassin tracking bourne  i was at a bit of a loss about julia stiles role as an operative in paris  she looked like she would be more at home playing high school field hockey  her casting seemed thrown in to have more eye candy in the film,intelligence
i have a hard time believing that this is the best these people were able to do with this cast and this material i have no idea why young aspiring actors like matt damon julia stiles and franka potente please ask tom tykwer to give you a decent role again franka felt compelled to play roles in this moviethe script must have looked like a mess with the line moving swiftly along now printed at least three times per page okay the scenes are probably in sequence but there is no continuity or natural flow of events the editing is pretty shoddy as well looks like someone tried to fit material based on a 10000 page script into a 100 page time framethe camera work made me nervous and giddy for all the wrong reasons it is a steadicam not a shakycam guys and this isnt nypd blue the production values are hardly any higher than in a lowbudget dolph lundgren action movie destined to go straight to videothe movie opens on a ship so of course the camera is tilting left and right this is way beyond a tired cliche it is tedious and distracting and the tilting is overdone to a degree that i actually  wondered why the actors or the camera man did not fall overtalking about cliches  there we have those amazing cia computers again that can do anything in a few seconds so we have a blurry cam picture shot from half a mile away zooming in actually sharpens the picture  and three seconds later we know that this person paid a bill in belgium three months ago  in font size 25 and spawning at least 15 wildly animating processes onscreen this worked fine when a pc cost 50000 dollars and 95 of the audience had never heard of them but come on  database queries arent that spectacular even with the cias budgetthere appears to be no cinematography or photographic pride at all not even one single nice and captivating shot it looks like it was a tv movie filmed in the shortest possible time on a limited budget and with several people already thinking about their next project and rightly soi know a spy thriller can do with a bit of suspended disbelief but there is so much distraction and nonsense going on and the characters and action are so close to caricature that disbelief hits you over the head most of the time instead of pulling the viewer into the train of events the pace and the editing leave only one lasting impression did they try to finish the movie in time before dinnerthis movie could have done a lot better with a slower and more even pace a leaner and tighter script classier cinematic camera work and way less editing less balls better juggling,intelligence
bourne identity is definitely robert ludlums best novel but can it translate well into a good film after watching films like sphere based on the michael crighton novel by the same name and queen of the damned based on the anne rice novel and after enduring all the films loosely based on dean r koontzs great novels i can say i wasnt expecting much out of bourne identity fortunately bourne identity proves that not all films taken out of grandiose novels turn out to be mediocre entertainment  in the novel the terrorist carlos is the enemy  needless to say that had to be changedcarlos is in jail now  if you read the book you will realize that a lot of chapters were simply skipped  there was no option  if the movie had had every chapter from the novel put into the film it would have lasted more than four hoursjust like the miniseries by the same name that came out in 1988 despite all the changes made to the movie despite all the deviations from the original story some of them rather risky bourne identity is a great filmmatt damon is definitely a great actor  and his good acting doesnt fail to disappoint here  and franka potente makes a great sidekick she is far from being the typical hollywood good actress  and this role was definitely for her  in one movie scene you will see matt damon cutting her hair  then she dyes it  this woman colored her hair blond once  then she shaved it all  now she is letting a man with amnesia give her a haircut  she just cant stop doing things to her hair not that it bothers me nothing about this actress is annoying she was impressing in run lola run and she continues to be same thing can be said about matt damon he was great in the talented mr ripley and he was perfect for the role of jason bourne an agent suffering from amnesia who must find out who and what he is and the more he learns about himself the more in danger he getsbourne identity is far from being the typical spy film here there are no amazing hard to believe gadgets that seem to come out of james bond films here there are no amazing explosions that seem more like advertisement for good pyrotechnic companies than parts of any film it is just a good suspense story equipped with believable actionthis is a movie every fan of the genre should see,intelligence
fans of the book beware this movie is not a good adaptation it fails to be true in my opinion to most of the plot and plot twists of the book so as an adaptation of the book i would give the movie 1 out of 10if you havent read the book and are just looking for a good thiller of a movie then this movie will please you and i would give it a 7 out of 10this averages to my rating of 4 out 10 for the movie,intelligence
the first hour of is as good as a thriller gets superb action a great story and good acting and for the whole that is what the film is like but for me the ending is a bit to hollywood for my liking and considering the story is good the end seems a major let down matt damon is suprisingly good as in this lead role because you dont usually associate him as the beat em up james bond type character but he pulls this off wellthe car chase is one of the best you will see and a british mini at thatalso the action scenes are superb and keep you on the edge of your seat its just a shame the ending does not match up with the rest of the film 8 out of 10,intelligence
this film version of robert ludlums 1980 spy thriller is equal parts brains and brawn matt damon as john bourne a cia black ops spy who suffers from amnesia and spends the film piecing together the last two weeks of his life uses his intellect as much as his fists this is a smart movie made even better by some wise choices for director and star doug liman director of swingers and go brings a refreshing excitement to this tired old genre and manages to deliver some unexpected thrills franka potente best known for run lola run as maria a young woman who unwittingly finds herself involved in international intrigue hands in a star making performance as a viewer her character is the only one in the film that we can relate to shes an ordinary person put in extraordinary circumstances look for clive owen in a cameo as the professor a hired killer sent to assassinate bourne in his three or four lines of dialogue he talks about the moral quandaries of his line of work its a beautifully acted moment and a nice twist on the usual killerforhire character,intelligence
any one who readliked the book will hate the movie the genius of the plot is gone it is replaced by a cliched cia thriller plotpros   good acting good action  very good first halflet downs hopeless attempt to port the story to modern time  hopeless attempt to change the story line  trying to make jason bourne do a spiderman thingbut if you havent read the book want to see a decent spyaction flick this is not a bad option,intelligence
this was an unoriginal waste of celluoid time talent chris cooper franka potente blasting caps squibs set pieces vehicles etcthe action was entertaining but completely implausible being that ive seen what guns can do to people i did not accept this film from the beginning for reasons one will find out when reading about the plot to this film and what i couldnt believe was the fact that this movie really thought it was coolhip and original this kind of genre is as dead as eighttrack tapes and i would of expected better from a director like doug liman i think  was the only reason why this film was made money for universal money for the director for the actors there was nothing else appealing except it had great photography at times and helped me brush up on my germanbut thats it youre better off watching mission impossible it made just as much sense as this film,intelligence
 was a good action movie  it had some exciting action scenes and car chases and if not examined too much a decent story  the story was somewhat conventional spy fare with double crosses and hidden agendas and was done in a style that didnt require a total suspension of belief in the laws of physics  matt damon was good and franka potente played a unconventional but intriguing female lead  brian cox and clive owen played their roles convincingly  julie stiles was good looking  there wasnt much else for her to do  the european setting was attractive and the scenes with the mini were fun  for mindless fun it is worthy of a watch,intelligence
james bond movies the most overrated movies ever every bond film is ridiculous boring childish idiotically propagandistic they still try to squeeze evil russians into the scripts and unintentionally funnydoug liman did something that i believe no one expected to see he reinvented the genre by making a movie that feels 100 real no vin diesel herehe achieved realism by escaping hollywood as he shoot the entire movie in europe he also chose to use an intelligent looking actor matt damon for the leading role the script never gets cheesy or boring or unreal and i believe that matt damon being a great screen writer helps in this directionfranka potente is also very good as well as the rest of the great castthe action sequences look fresh and powerful while they stay away from cliches the entire movie is shot in a way that gives the impression that everything was shot on location almost like a late 70s movie doug liman really did a great jobi believe that is something that will be remembered in the years to come and it is most probably the best spy movie ever1010,intelligence
i knew the movie was just loosely based on ludlums book before i saw the movie but i was still a little taken aback at how little of the book actually made it onto the screen there were no twists or turns in the movie the plot was totally transparentthe movie was not totally unenjoyable  although thoroughly predictable it was paced pretty well and the action scenes didnt seem to overwhelm the plot overall the acting was decent even though conklin was overacted i must admit i found the ending amusing and this probably saved the movie for mebasically they took an above average spy tale and turned it into an average spy flick i cant see how anybody who has read the book could be very satisfied with this movie,intelligence
i thought this was a well done film and it reminded me of having read the novel about 15 years ago as well as what a good writer ludlum could be he could also be pretty bad as in the chancellor manuscript but the film was nowhere near as intricate and interesting as the novel  to be fair there is no way a two hour movie can capture a book of over 500 pages that never lets up on the action  franka potente was superb as was clive owen  what i cant believe is the number of people gushing over matt damon who is a unbelievable as an assassin because he is so wimpy and b an incredibly bad actor  as a critic once said about the young katherine hepburn damon runs the gamut of emotions from a to b  he is the one glaring hole in the cast and it is too bad that among the three chief cast members he is the american  he may be able to write or produce but all the praise for his acting is just another case of the emperors new clothes much like his equally talentless pal ben affleck,intelligence
i read robert ludlums obit in the economist and so had to read one of his books i picked the economist was right ludlum was an awful writer who did brilliant plotting you stay up to three am to get to the last pageuses a surefire hook a man fished out of the sea with a load of bullets in his carcass minor brain damage and no memory there are only a few clues to whom he might bea numbered swiss bank account heavyduty martial skills espionage instincts etc and hes got nothing no money no id nothing and excellent reasons to believe someone stills wants him dead and he suffers terrible migraines and flashbacks did i mention flashbacks so right away youre pulling for him he reenters the world living by his witscrucially you are a long way into the book before the truth starts to emerge but even then it is murky the cia the vietnam war international terrorism etc clearly he was involved in something big and nastynot so with this movie almost immediately you see the us government connection goodbye suspenseand goodbye human interest in the book jason is tortured ad nauseamas is the reader by ludlums proseby the question of just what kind of person he really is its barely there in the movie the same for character depth you really dont end up caring much about jason marie anybodyin the book marie is forced to join him against her will with time she becomes his ally adding her own valuable skills and knowledge to help jason survive and triumph in the movie marie is merely this lost clueless gypsyi dont know anything about the director but cant help getting the impression that he came up doing rock videos and tv commercials the camera work is very edgy it is meant to look hip and now they let him do a real movie bad decisionthe action stuff is very good all the chases and fightsthe actors were quite good matt damon is wasted in something like this,intelligence
what does the 2002 bourne identity movie have in common with the 1977 or so book  a main character named jason bourne who suffers from amnesia a love interest named marie and well nothing elsedo yourself a favor  get bourne identity as a dollar rental somewhere someday  please dont buy it or pay full price to rent it  even better spend 8 and go buy the book  its an amazingly fast read and has 10x the action and suspense of the moviethe movie strips away bournes reason for being his true identity his nemesis most of treadstone 71 and a lot of the different locations that were used in the book  really the 02 release is a hollow shell relying solely on a popular book title and matt damons facedisappointing to be sure,intelligence
this film just reinforced a feeling i had that some directors think that it is entertaining to keep the audience confused and lost throughout the movie this hard to follow and quite boring waste of film stock employs matt damon who i dont really like but whatever he did a decent job of not getting on my nerves at least bottom line i could have lived without seeing this this movie doesnt warrant a further expense of energy from me,intelligence
boring the only reason why i gave the movie 410 was because of the nice shots from europe just because one tries to make a story as confusing as possible doesnt make it interesting halfway through the movie i wanted to stop it and pop frantic in broume has two leading characters one doesnt really care for doesnt understand their motives and actually after a while even stops caring about what they are doing in the movie the german actress was running back and forth through berlin in run lola run now she is running through paris but this time the movie around her doesnt work and her acting is way too stiff to elevate the film from its low,intelligence
anyone who thinks that this film has anything to do with the book of the same name is in for a great big surprise the sum total of the similarities are the name of the leading character and the fact that he is found in the sea with amnesia and the skills of an assassin thats it the plot motivation female lead and relationships have been rewritten from scratchand unfortunately the movie is much the worse for itludlums original novel which had a relatively faithful but poorly made tv movie done if it many years ago is one of his best works and indeed spawned two sequels albeit of decreasing quality this film throws the entire central point and a thoughtprovoking creative one at that of the book out the window and replaces it with a story so predictable and suspenseless that you sit on the edge of your seat waiting vainly for a surprise twist that never materializesdamon and potente may be good actors and conceivably damon although not his female costar could have been appropriately cast in a faithful rendition of the source but this movie simply misfires on all cylinders i saw it on dvd which contains a thoroughly horrid making of video including brief interviews with the cast the bizarre thing is that they all sound like theyre making some deep profound breakthrough crossgenre film when the result is a notverygood lessthanrunofthemill spy thrilleroh well if you want to see the sort of thing that the combination of the ludlum name and this films trailer promised check out damons buddys recent work ben affleck in sum of all fears its not great cinema either but its certainly a better thriller with at least the thread of a believable plot i really dont see how i can give this more than 5 out of 10,intelligence
jason bourne i can tell you the license numbers of all six cars outside i can tell you the waitress is lefthanded i can tell you the guy sitting at the bar weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself i know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside and i know that at this altitude i can run flat out for a half a mile before my hands start shaking now why would i know that how can i know that and not know who i amthis is a great spy movie it sheik and stylish however bond it is not thank god there are no stupid gadgets and no point less puns they are repacked with style and thought bourne is an intelligent spy who use his brains instead of jumping into a situation headfirst for example looking at a map before a car chase how many times have you seen bond do that huh the fact that this film is set entirely in europe makes it individual and gives it a little something extra which is always good the great cast grip your attention add damon is a brilliant he shows bourne strengths and weakness and give him a human quality over all the film is great and defiantly worth watching so im biest but give me bourne over bond any day,intelligence
the book by robert ludlum has been one of my favorites since it was first released  both the characters and plot are complex  this movies characters are totally one dimensional  there is no acting  and i think matt damon is a wonderful actor  but he was wasted in this film  he barely had any lines and certainly no depth  the plot doesnt even make sense i have been so looking forward to this movie and now that ive seen it am sooooooo disappointed  the tv miniseries staring richard chamberlain was so much better  i can understand wanting to update the story but everything that made this such a wonderful book was completely ignored  too bad,intelligence

this movie shot mainly in switzerland and france was one of the few movies ive seen that lives up to its billing from its days as a book  i am more impressed with matt damon each time i see him in a new movie  i think that he brings jason bourne to life very effectively  the movie flows quite nicely was well edited and well shot  im sure it was difficult filming in switzerland in the winter and quite difficult filming in paris as well the director makes it look flawless  franka potente who i believe is a real hidden gem as an actress proves once again that she has global appeal and that her effective performance in the movie blow was no fluke  what i really enjoyed about was the action sequences  for some reason most hollywood movies overdo these parts of the film to compensate for a weak story  doesnt rely on them at all as the story would probably flow just fine without them however they are well acted well choreographed yet not the focus of the film i personally hope that there is a sequelperfect score,intelligence
is a better film than i thought it would matt damon makes a believeable action hero and doug liman does the atcion thing very well the car chase sequence is one of the best from 2002 if you havent seen this check it out its good entertainement,intelligence
this movie had absolutely nothing to do with the original story so masterfully told in ludlums book and subsequent trilogy  if the producers are going to make such a huge departure from plot and details they should just give the flick another name instead of trying to scam fans of the series  even without this glaring shortcoming the movie itself as a spy film was just average the rhythm and pacing erratic and the plot hardly compelling,intelligence
this is one of the worst movies of 2002 first of all it doesnt evenresemble the book by robert ludlum they made this up as theywent along it was all special effects and not much else first and foremost matt damon looked way too young for the parthe is supposed to be a master spy and he looked like he justgraduated collegezero credibility then the girls part was a doctor of economics  she was all wettoo then they brought in a trio of assassins to get rid of bourne whata waste of talent in clive owen who is one of the best new actorsaround anyone who saw second sight will attest to his talent how cute they made the professor his character  drive a bmwafter all those commercials he owen did as the driver this wasa cutesy touch next  what ever happened to the character of carlos who was animportant part of the story in the bookif you want to see a better version of this book rent the  tv moviemade in the 80s with richard chamberlin he at least had thematurity and credibility to play jason bourne and jaclyn smith wasat least believable as the doctor who becomes first his victim andlater his allyshe plays  drmarie stjacques a canadian economist whose lifeintertwines with that of the spy on the runthe tv versions also had better location shots the new versionwas so dank and cold and wet all the time it made me want tohave a box of kleenex ready in case i got a coldi can only say that everyone in this film was motivated by one thingto quote a great line from sean connerys character in themoviethe great train robbery when asked why he committedthe crime he repliesi did it for the moneymy sentiments exactly,intelligence
remember 39 steps there was this man who was on the run and then there was this totally strange woman with him why was she with him because she was handcuffed to him that is why and why was she handcuffed because otherwise there would be no earthly reason why she would follow him and because movie makers at the time had some respect for their audiences that brings me to bourne now it may seem unfair to compare some runoffthemill film to hitchcock but the sad fact is these guys nowadays sorry to generalize here but the movie made me so angry dont care about plausibility because they despise their popcorneating audience of course you should not start thinking about the story of 39 steps which is also ridiculous but the point is hitchcock makes you want to believe and care for the characters suspense of disbelief and all that in bourne identity the first 5 minutes are okay we just do not want to know why the hero has this bank number implanted in case he loses memory he goes to switzerland i buy that but then he beats the police guys just why you have pockets full of money but have to spend the night in the house of a friend when you are on the run potente is not bad but she surely does not save this one,intelligence
warning some spoilers aheadwhat the hell happened with this movie the first part was literally breathtaking due to the suspence amazing action sequences and cool music and i found myself thinking that this might actually be a cool movie but as soon as bourne reads that newspaper and puts all the missing pieces together the movie instantly looses its tempo and meaning after we discover bournes identitycoincidentally the title of the movie well i guess theres just no point in dragging the movie any longer unless the story had a deeper purpose or meaning not in this case though bourne decides to singlehandedly challenge the organisation he works for so he can then after some action scenes of course leave it on his own terms sounds easy well they make it look even easier oh yeah and just before the end theres a scene that looks so ridiculously dumb and unbelievable that even tom cruises scenes on the motorcycle in mi2 or pierce brosnans leap to catch the falling plane in goldeneye started looking somewhat credible it was like the director lost his focus for the 2nd half the whole background of bournes spy organisation is explained in a single line how or why he became a 30 million dollar government property is sadly never revealed nice appearance by adewale akinnuoyeagbaje and the sexy franka potente thoughgood action doesnt make up for a meaningless story 610,intelligence
needless is to say that matt damon has been for these last few years attached to great films all of them made history for its quality the talented mr ripley most noticeably however the time came for a bad project to come the wrongest thing in is the plot and the directing at points the plot getss too confusing at times maybe it was their wish anyway when we discover what all of that was about than it is much ado about nothing director doug liman is very effective sometimes but cant keep up the rythm he put up himself the chases and the fights are impressive and the camera movements are mindfreezing but when the pressure be held he forgets about it too bad the cast in its way is very good damon is a fine actor and always fits well in every role german actress franka potente assures the comedy and the lovely good girl who starts with a good english but by the end of the movie it gets worse and worse chris cooper is good also after american beauty he is still looking for another memorable role the biggest surprise is however julia stiles to be honest i never really liked her but in this film she proved otherwise this film is not one of those that you cant say i loved it its perfect neither can you say ew what an huge peace of  it has its way of being enjoyable unfortunately it worked average for me,intelligence
only common with the original book  only title and the name of the main hero matt damon  not the super agent bad montage very bad story very disappointing not recommended to all thriller lovers best spend time looking spy games,intelligence
i just read another reader review stating that was an inferior movie to spy game and also heavily influenced by the brad pittrobert redford schlockfestbut believe me that reviewer was about as wrong as it is humanly possible to be is fun exciting and totally enjoyable i really liked the relationship between marie and jason and the fight scenes were cool that other review reckoned that borrowed heavily from the matrix again this is a crock in fact this is one of the first action movies in a long while not to do so the action in this movie was believable as was maries response to such extreme violence this i found to be very refreshing theres too many movies where innocent people have little or no response to witnessing insane acts of violenceanyway i read the ludlum book after seeing the movie and i honestly prefer the movie jason and maries relationship is more believable and whereas the movie is taught and exciting the book becomes boring and predictablei used to prefer ben affleck to matt but this movie has led me to change teams matt rocks and he also loves australian beer what a charger,intelligence
in fact i think the film is too regular it is not loyal to the book giving a lack of punch to anyone who has read it and experienced jason up close and personalthe casting is okay but not excellent i never imagined jason would have the shape of damon many of the spythriller details from the book have been erased completely from the movie leaving it as a rather dull product merely made to entertain at a moderate level the sound is turning its back on you the music is not too good and the sound effects are almost boringif you liked the film however i can certainly recommend the book  it has a lot more to offer,intelligence
for all the pedoff children of the world who crave good oldfashioned values like a decent script decent characterisation suspense action humour style and the sheer exhilaration of watching cars being driven at inappropriate speeds through narrow streets i give you  sure its not perfect but any action film in which noone ever says i want this guys ass gets my vote  similarly its worth pointing out that what dialogue there is is intelligent unpatronising and lacking in the usual macho overthetop profanities  as the amnesiac confused blank lead matt damon with his weirdly flat body and strange upsidedown mouth is perfect  hes not a great actor but he can look serious and confused and quietly determined  which in this film is all he needs to do luckily he is surrounded by a superb cast including the wonderful star of run lola run the authentically disheveled chris cooper he looks like hes been wearing that shirt for weeks the enigmatic clive owen what a fine actor he is becoming  the next bond anyone  or the next bond villain and of course brian cox  lets face it if youre making this sort of film brian cox is obligatory there are smartlyshot fight sequences a great car chase a respectably sultry and tenuous love scene and my favourite a snowbound encounter with the aforementioned owen who says very little but makes every word count theres nothing desperately original on show here but in a movie world where evermore vacuous cretinous nonsense seems to be the order of the day its nice to find a pleasingly oldfashioned bit of action that allows the audience to leave the cinema smiling rather than demanding their money back and trying to get the nasty taste out of their mouths,intelligence
soiler alert there was one bit of this film that made me jump enough though i knew what was about to happen this for me is the sign of a good film nothing truly original but well put together and quite absorbing in places if only matt damon had turned bad at the end,intelligence
i never read the book but i thought this film was very fun entertaining and very good throughout the action was crisp and it moved very well from one locale to the nextthe plot may be a reject from every other bmovie actioner around but its still good and whilst bourne isnt a secret agent of sorts he is an assassin out to kill some african delegate threatening to expose cia missions in the congo or somethingi think matt damon plays bourne very well his aikidojujitsu is very fresh fast and he gives the impression hes doing it on instict rather than showing he knows the movesyes it did drag a bit and yes every cliche out of hollywood comes out of this for example hes an assassin who cares  pleeze  but i think its pretty good for a cheap seat at a cheap cinema i wouldnt go top dollar for this movie i dont think its worth itjulia stiles is also in this but doesnt really do anything of interest the most intreging character was clive owens professor saying almost nothing but showing off his brooding james bondtim dalton with glasses lookits entertaining until the very end where damon decides to go all out as chow yun fat wannabebut whereas fat would slide down the bannister damon jumps off the side and flies down to the bottom that one sequence is just plain stupid and funny at the same time when its not meant to beoverall 610,intelligence
bourne identity is one of the best novels i have read and to find the story totally changed was quite disappointing most of the action sequences were captured as close camera angles where you hardly see whats happening two dimensional acting did not help the picture at all,intelligence
im not sure what to make of this movie either the theater where i saw it had a terrible print or this is one murky jerky movie it seemed to be going for a 60s70s french connection look which may be vintage but also looks outofdate and hokey these days i kinda felt seasick after watching it the whole idea seemed to be to spend a bunch of money to make it look cheap didnt work for meother problems  matt damons character was so underdrawn as to seem like a robot making his search for who he was not all that interesting and any relationship with franka potentes character just seem odd like why would she drive him to paris why would anyone and why stick with him theres nothing to fall for in an automatonthe car chase was fun and fizzy but the fall down the stairs was just silly the haircut  you gotta be kidding why did she have to cut and dye her hair when he didnt change his appearance at all and bournes problem with kiddies didnt read for me for a minuteif they wanted bondesque spy stuff with a goofy twist they forgot the twist if they wanted something deeper they went too far over the top with bournes unbelievable spy guy exploitssomebody put this one on automatic pilot and then set the camera to seasick not great not great at all,intelligence
i had wanted to see this one for a while due to some good reviews and of course the combination of doug liman directing franka potente in a spy movie  to be honest i wasnt expecting to be all that impressed with damon  however he ends up doing a marvelous job of portraying a seemingly average joe in a nomemory predicament think leonard shelby who seems to have the instincts of james bond and bruce lee together the embassy sequence is especially savvy  the action sequences here feel realistic also with the possible exception of that final stunt and the showdown between clive owen and damon is very tight and unusually quiet for a hollywood thriller actually the setting direction editing music frequent use of subtitles and the use of franka potente brilliant pairing but why do they go from making out to him sleeping on the floor as damons love interest make this whole thing feel very much like a european spy thriller  i felt like i was watching a luc besson film but besson hasnt done anything this good in years  the ending does a very good job of pulling together the loose ends and i heard they had a hard time figuring out what to do  kudos for making it work   our reel had some problems its been playing every night since june 14 so i forgive the projectionist and so a few plot points were missed  what was alliance securities and how did they find it  how was kane connected to the boat  how did bourne know that pressing r on his phone would link him to the hotel regina  how did wombosi or bourne know to go to that morgue to search for the body and whose body was in the bag if not his  i might just go see it again so it makes more sense   so far hollywood this summer has provided some really inventive films insomnia star wars episode ii my big fat greek wedding bourne identity reign of fire road to perdition austin powers 3 even minority report with its cliched ending provided some cool moments  keep it up guys  it seems were going through a bit of a rebirth,intelligence
i m really not sure about this one  i had the nagging feeling id seen something like it before then id get it mixed up with a completely different film and that was the constant problem from about 20 minutes into the film yes weve been there seen that and bought the dvd nicely done but whats the point of an amnesia flick with no surprises an action movie with second hand action a thriller with old well you get my point long kiss goodnight was more fun ronin more thrilling and mission impossible more accomplishedmatt damon makes a fair stab at the bewildered action hero but could do better at the puzzlement he should convey when he starts to meet the other operatives and tries to put together a life that makes sense the rest of the cast just do their jobs brian cox really must be bored by now  give that man a fresh role somebody more dja vu than amnesia flick  must try harder to stand out and have an original angle very average,intelligence
aside from a good chase scene and some interesting photography the rest of this ludlum tale either falls on its face viz the superhuman feats of the amnesiac bourne become rather trite after a while or flattens out to a rather dull thud the absence of a strong underlying story  too bad as the gimmick in ludlums book ie the loose cannon the injured traumatized bourne who is tied somehow to carlos the jackal is now out of date with the aging carlos presently behind bars in france  the script lacks an overarching conspiracy in spite of an overworked attempt to implicate a conspiracy group within the cia who after the recent revelation of debacles show the cia minions are a parody of themselves the plot falters  the film really never goes anywhere  it becomes one beat em up scene after another sparked by nearly impossible situations  the sceneshifting plot inside plot spy vs spy model of the ludlum work is definitely missing  too bad  brian cox who created the role of hannibal lector and matt damon are nearly always worth the price of admission  too wasted are the talents of character actors clive owen and chris cooper finally the female interest german franka potente looks lost most of the time while this is not a bad film ludlum fans will be very let down as old robert really caught our interest with this novel  we would have liked a better script based on a decent novel,intelligence
its the script nothing of any merit can be accomplished in film without a decent screenplay and suffers accordingly a majority of the dialogue is muddled seemingly adlibbed in parts and fails to advance the story properly or provide its characters with substantial material for which to base a decent performance  to doug limans credit the fight scenes are outstanding but are not enough to save the plodding and lifeless storyline  what is tragic here is that there was so much to work with  has been begging to be made into a motion picture for years and im baffled at how something with such promise could be done such a disservice  first the motivations of the characters are underdeveloped and misplaced which is a script problem second the emotional gravity that liman tries so desperately to build is undercut by uneven performances and what amounts to some terrible editing but which in the end is a product of the awful script  damon never seems to establish the proper tone for an intercontinental coldblooded super assassin and poor franka potente awesome in run lola run struggles to lend believability to a ridiculously halfbaked charactershe may be a flighty vagabond but please wheres her motivation  chris cooper is adequate but a little unkempt and anxious for a selfrighteous coolheaded cia program director  however any flaws in the performances can again all be attributed to the script  i imagine the pressure of making your first bigbudget studio pic can cloud judgment and strain your patience but i hope liman has learned from his mistakes here and chooses in the future to demand more from those drafting the content on which he is working,intelligence
ill admit i went to see this movie because i like clive owen his role although he plays it superbly is very small however i came out a matt damon fan this movie has it all action suspense mystery sexuality scenery intrigue yes you have to suspend your reality but isnt that what makes seeing a movie fun ive never read the ludlum novels and i normally dont go see action movies but this one was deeper darker somehow the special effects dont knock you over the head rather they fit in perfectly with the movies pace go see this you wont be disappointed now all i have to do is get matt damon to come and cut my hair once you see it youll understand that im a female reviewer,intelligence
most film adaptations of popular novels thrill the casual viewer but end up disappointing readers  is no different  this version while featuring action sequences galore fluffs over the plot  the storyline feels contrived deliberate and conventional  matt damon and franka potente both give solid  but unspectacular  performances  as a summer movie bourne identity is enjoyable but dont go expecting the next femme nikita or french connection 610,intelligence
considering that the majority of this countrys population is illiterate and would choose to see the movie rather than read the book there will probably be many people who enjoy this film  unfortunately for the literate minority this film took a wonderful book and destroyed it  the plot of the novel was hacked to pieces and it is painful to watch for any fans of ludlums book  everyone else seems to think the movie is lots of fun so i urge you to see it before reading the book but if you want a good plot turn to the book and please dont rate this film until youve done so and can give us an informed opinion,intelligence
after seeing the trailer of i was really looking forward to the film because it promised to be a gripping spy thriller well after seeing it i was a little disappointed this does not mean that the film is bad but although it was a spy thriller it was not gripping this is because youve seen similar films over and over again this might lead to the impression that you can predict what comes next and you certainly can the action sequences are definitely state of the art but the plot wont take your breath away this is partly because you have the feeling that mat damonjason bourne does all this searching for his identity not because of curiosity but because hes got an awful lot of time on his hands furthermore the romance between f potente  m damon bears more resemblance to an arranged marriage than to affection in short this is a movie full of cliches which can be recommended if you want to spend some time on a rainy day,intelligence
did anyone who helped make this movie even bother to read the book although a very mildly entertaining movie nothing but the names had anything to do with the bookwhat cruise ship  jason bourne was washed overboard from a trawler which he watched explode first  he was helped to recover via an english alcoholic doctor in france  from there he travels to the bank in which they start to follow and try to kill him  as he tries to escape out of zurich maire becomes his hostage to get him where he needs to go  shes a doctor of economics not a down and out womanshes canadian not american so she never should have been in the embassy to begin with  not to mention jason never even steps foot in the american embassyeventually after jason saves her life she decides to help him find out who he is  what about carlos  there is never any mention of him or cain or medusa  cain comes out of medusa to try and capture carlos  the worlds most dangerous killeras for treadstone seventyone its located in washington dc not france lets not forget david abbott who created cain in order to get carlosi could go on forever about the extreme differences with this movie the original movie and the book but that would take too longas far as i can tell this unoriginal action movie was passable at best but has nothing to do with the novel that robert ludlum wrote  dont waste your time or money with this one  if you dont want to read the book at least watch the original movie with richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith  it was a miniseries made in 1988 and follows the book a lot better than this supposed remake  the acting and the characters are true to form versus the cute but way too young for jason bourne matt damon,intelligence
this film is very european  it seems that when europeans do films the films have more of a darker side to them  you can tell by the grainy film quality casting of characters and locations  the cia director was what one would expect a person in this position to be like  i do not think it was believable that they would have assassins but if they did would they be that well trained  overall the film was great the cast was picked out perfectly  matt damon has improved since the  talented mr ripley  i could not feel sorry for any of the characters they all knew what type of game they were playing  this one is a winner a must see 810,intelligence
i was very disappointed in bourne identity  i had read reviews and expected to see a mystery but i did not realize that it was one of those loud bang car races type of movie this is a movie for the younger generation   every time bourne hit someone with his fist the sound was like an earthquake through the theater i rate the film a 4 out of a possible 10 tops give me a quiet mystery anytime     and make it not quite as much mystery,intelligence
after a solid and intriguing opening about the first 30 minutes bourne identity deteriorates into a rather typical thriller that might not be so bad but because it leads you to believe youre in for something goodsomething a little different than your run of the mill hollywood chase flickits a major disappointment theres simply no suspense created and no surprise as to how this movie ends yawn,intelligence
plot  characters  conflict  theme  these are all qualities possessed by both the robert ludlum novel and the 1988 madefortv production of but entirely lacking in this incarnation  the director and writer extract a very promising premise from the original but ignore every detail of execution that made it into a wellcrafted storya wellmade thriller is a thrill for the mind  the conflicts the situations and motivations of characters are complex and require mental effort to follow  and the effort pays off because when we pay attention and expend the effort were rewarded with understanding and consequently entertained  this film shows absolute contempt for the mind of the audience  the situations and character perspectives are an embarrassing mix of the obvious and the arbitrary  typically modern sloppy script  as one example out of hundreds in the original bourne catches on quickly to his likely identity as a killer but marie whos had a chance to observe him and get a sense of his character tries to convince him hes not or at least not a criminal  this gives her an actual purpose in the furtherance of the story not to mention providing some real tension and meaningful dialogue in the early part of the story  this whole aspect is missing in this version the filmmakers perspective is clearly why bother with all that intellectual nonsense  just make her attracted to him but a little scared and let them trade a couple of oneliners and everyone will understanddoug limans camera work shows similar contempt for our higher faculties he is apparently from the ifthecamerastaysinoneplaceformorethanathousandthofasecondthe audiencewillgetupandleave school  and in all the action sequences the shots are so tight as to prevent any actual visual perspective of the situation  im up in the air as to whether this is done purely for the desired style or whether its just laziness in not wanting to go to the trouble of carefully organizing all the onscreen elements in such a way that a long shot will look rightmodern films made along these lines are always disappointing but when they take a work that has so many great attributes and deliberately leave most of them behind just to make a typical plotless action movie it is especially infuriating,intelligence

the spy genre seems top be a little out of steam these days the only good spy film ive seen in a long time was spy game saved by the two leads the terrific technical aspects and the human side it brought to the story its like watching the same movie over and over again commmon endings bad performances predictable twists i have no idea why people liken to these garbage films okay so it was a disappointmetn to the book but what movie isnt the performances in this movie are very good save potentes accent changing especially in the smaller parts like chris coopers and clive owens who had little material to work with first i thought when the showed the wombosi tape and the meeting that this movie would take the common path and focus too much on other issues besides the main plot matt damon but that quickly changed and i was presented wiht a very well shot slightly cliched but excellent spy thriller the fight scenes were awesome the car chase almost as good as roninsbut ronin sucked besides that so who caresand my favourite scene of the movie and tied for favourite of the year so far with the final duel in monte cristo is when damon and owen are in the woods having their spy showdownive always wanted to make a movie just so i could have a scene shot like thatbut liman got to it first oh yeah doug limanswingers was awesome too nice switch see it this is top grade action thriller a wonderful spy movie and just a plain awesome moviei dont know what anyones problem wiht it is,intelligence
matt damon stars as a young man found floating in the middle of the ocean by some french fisherman he has no memory of who he is but he does have a weird computer chip implanted in his hip and two bullets in his back the chip contains a number of an account in zurich and there he finds a safetydeposit box with multiple passports a lot of money and a gunthe young man chooses the identity of jason bourne from the box but who is jason bourne the money and the ids along with his supersonic reflexes and handtohand fighting skills seem to indicate that hes not your typical car salesman for whom does bourne work is he an assassin a good guy a bad guy and whos following him anyway bourne hightails it out of zurich heading to paris in the company of marie franka potente who accepts his offer of 10000 to drive him and another 10000 when they get there and of the course of the bulk of the movie bourne tries to reconstruct his life  and his identitiesthe movie is based on a robert ludlum potboiler thriller and was made into a tv movie in 1988 with richard chamberlain as jason bourne having not read the book yet i had no real expectations of the movie matt damon however did strike me as a little too young for the role hes a good actor and this is a good role for him to work on his acting chops but he just didnt do it for me in this movie damon can be appealing at times but hes still relatively early in his career and just not the heavyweight that this role seemed to demand he seemed very unsure of himself although of course bournes very unsure not knowing who he is or what hes become veering at times from strongwilled action hero to puzzled milquetoast as marie potente isnt half bad  shes actually very good and she gets better as the movie progresses shes a wanderer without a real home much like bourne and potente does a fine job of essaying her characters change from someone being forced on a mission to a faithful sidekick of sortsanother problem is the lack of chemistry between damon and potente the scenes they shared  and there were plenty  should have been sizzling but they pretty much died in terms of chemistry luckily there was plenty of action surrounding them to make up for this failing the worst problem however was the directing itself doug liman swingers is a pretty good director but this was his first shot at a spy thriller too bad he dropped the ball  the pacing is absolutely leaden throughout much of the film either a lot of things were happening  which can be good as it disguises plot holes  or nothing was happening if providing a sense of atmosphere was the goal the film did not succeed the writing itself was pretty crisp although the characters were a little flat and aside from the two leads they were caricatures including coopers machiavellian bad guy the explosions and car chases were great but thats become the norm for these films,intelligence
what exactly is it that determines the moral code by which a person lives and can the very same person be a coldblooded murderer in one incarnation then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away  these provocative questions are raised though never adequately explored in a fairly standard manontherun spy thriller based on the best selling novel by robert ludlum  written by tony gilroy and directed by doug liman tells the story of jason bourne a cia hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bulletriddled body was plucked floating out of the mediterranean sea  initially unaware of his secret agent status jason  together with marie a young woman he picks up in switzerland and hires to drive him to paris  tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose  essentially we are back in old hitchcock territory where the storys hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to himmight have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation  instead the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise  there are brief flashes where jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience but they are quickly thrown over for the usual catandmouse accoutrements of this oddmanout scenario  and frankly despite the novelty of the paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way nothing in the film really much engages the audiences sympathy or interest matt damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of bournes character but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a governmentgenerated killing machine  whats missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character whom we have come to view as comassionate and loving could ever have done the things he is said to have done that analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current formthe film is at its most interesting when it shows how bourne because he is himself a product of cia training can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game  the film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of paris though it pales in comparison to the ones in ronin  but i cant believe that filmmakers are still using that old standby  the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it  i thought that one had been put to rest finally and irrevocably 30 years ago in whats up doc,intelligence
spoilerswhy oh why cant we have a decent stylish thriller why for some reason directors think they can have some flashy binoculars and the words zurich switzerland in a computerstyle typewritten font and that all us idiots in the world will sigh oooohcool well not this idiot oh and i havent even gotten onto the ridiculous plotholes yetthe premise of the movie sounded good however you have to suspend disbelief immediately when youre supposed to believe that bourne didnt drown in the water in the beginning ill let that go though and move on when we finally have bourne on his feet were rewarded by some relatively solid acting matt damon is a far superior and more believable actor than ben affleck who was pretty unconvincing in the sum of all fears out around the same time as bourne anyway damon does a decent job as does franka potente who hasnt really done anything great since blow and run lola run  which was superb julia stiles should be ashamed of herself for taking such a nothing part and i wont any further mention of her during this review clive owen does a pretty suave job as a government hired assassin and i think well see a lot more of him in the future 007 perhaps anyway to the meat of the review  the terrible plot holes stop reading here if you havent see the movie firstly why exactly is it that the cia want bourne dead why it makes absolutely no sense wombosi was killed afterwards and so surely they just need to contact bourne and sort out the whole amnesia thing but no why not kill bourne no wait i think i figured out why the cia wanted to kill him  because the director thought it would make a good movie and that hopefully moviegoers wouldnt notice genius as soon as we see potente arguing at the american embassy you know shes going to be a part of the movie how wonderfully coincidental that she just happens to be outside with a soon to be porsche style mini when damon makes his escape how handy clichorama and what about that red bag damon leaves it at the station in the locker yet apparently never picks it up again how then does he happen to have it back when theyre shacked up at eamons house the point of leaving it at the station was what pray tell that might not be too ridiculous but youd think the director could at least understand time zones whilst making the movie meet me in paris at 530pm today says bourne in one scene we then see the plane quite clearly not a concorde  at the airport theres no possible way the cia agent could have made it to paris at that time you could just say im being picky but it just irked me the second that scene graced the screen sigh number 1 of many heckwatch the movie youll probably pick up far more instances than me in regards to the plot holesin regards to the action of which there was little  it was pretty irritating there was once nice car chase which has been likened to ronins but its not in the same league firstly bourne is driving a mini secondlywellis there need for one it did however amuse me when a policeman on a bike tries towellram the car or something i couldnt quite figure out that part car vs bike i wonder who will winin regards to the bourne fight scenes they were astonishingly poorly shot the camera kept moving in different directions it hurt the eyes to watch it was a real mess i could go on but i wont i feel like this review is written as badly as the movie was directed if youve seen the movie already youll know what i mean and if youre about to see the movie youll soon know what i mean oh and the ending can we say clich any more timessigh number 2 of many,intelligence
the closest resemblance to the ludlum novel was in title only  it could have been called the jones identity and they would not have had to pay the author a penny im still trying to figure out if this movie had a plot  it slammed covert ops portrayed politicians as naive and dishonestsome element of truth jason bourne as invincible and the french police as bumbling idiots another element of truth  someday a screenwriter will read more tamper less and enjoy greater success  save your money  enjoy the book,intelligence
this movie shows all  of its action sequences in the preview and at the theatre they are just extended and boring also the story was too confusing to keep up with if you were just trying to have a good time at the movies i wish i had never gone to see this movie if you want to wait until the dvd comes out and save money 50100,intelligence
having read the book and watched the original 2 part mini series starring richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith i was sort of expecting a disappointing movie and its pretty much everything i knew it would be the matt damon version does nothing to explain who jason bourne is or how he came to lose his memory and is loosely based on the book much the same way that a big mac combo is loosely described as food the plot is weak and the storyline doesnt explain anything the main character is portrayed as a man who has lost his memory while on a mission to kill someone no mention of the identity of the target is made or why jason bourne was sent to kill him in the first place and jason bournes real name isnt mentioned either if you want the real version i seriously recommend that you watch the original 2 part miniseries cos that is taken directly from the book if the next two movies are anything like the first then i wont be watching them,intelligence
what is wrong with this director if you liked the bourne books then do not watch his movies as it they make you cry the book had a great story that was exciting but plausible  a well thought out novel the only thing this film has in common with the book is that it 1 shares the same title and 2 the main characters have the same name apart from that the story is completely different and just a typical brainless hollywood action plotif the book had had the same plot as this movie then it would have never sold  you would have seen it with the other cheesy pulp at the supermarket checkoutthis director has a history of doing this he butchered the plot of the jumper book as well  i loved that books doug liman turned it into pure cheesedoes he think he can write better than these authors well he cannot i am saddened by what he has done to these books and if you are an author out there  dont let him near your book,intelligence
the movie is well done as so many plaudits attest but i read the book did they the movie is fine but should never have the same title if there isnt anything except the amnesia nothing oh yeah the characters name and some similar words marie treadstone so very hollywood in this with all their wrong politics nothing based on fact,intelligence
i remember this movie being an average film nothing amazing but nothing terrible either i thought when i watched it that chris copper had by far put up the best performance in the entire film in fact despite him being a villain i felt bad when he got killed off at the end since i had seen quite possibly the only good part actor wise get killed off the series anyways so i thought that the visuals were decent because none of it really felt like it was done on screen and the places looked like real areas that you can find and go to some of the action was really awesome and exciting while other bits sort of fell flat matt damon i thought has an alright performance but i didnt really think much of the female i thought she was pretty weak on the acting part overall the film isnt terrible but its no masterpiece i would say its worth watching once just to see what its all about,intelligence
a spy waking up without any memory is a classic tale and based on a novel by robert ludlum take that premise and runs with it matt damon plays the amnesiac jason bourne discovered in the ocean by a fishing vessel he seeks to discover his identity as he discovers that he has amazing abilities including a tremendous skill at handtohand combat and an extraordinary ability to drive a car he learns rapidly that hes pursued by the authorities and uses his skills to elude detection desperate to follow the clues he finds in a bank lockbox he offers marie franka potente twenty thousand dollars to take him to paris meanwhile agents track bournes movements including conklin chris cooper who answers to ward abbott brian cox it was interesting to see walton goggins pop up in these scenes in a minor role prior to his breakout fame they contact their agent in the field nicolette julia stiles and she hires top assassins like the professor clive owencheck out more of this review and others at swillikycom,intelligence
i really lean both ways when it comes to this one one part of me says wow this is a great movie with a cool plot and the other side says id rather be sleeping in my bed than sleeping through this moviefirst the good its realistic its got cool locations and the action is 100 real as in no cgi then the not so good theres really not too much dialogue and consequently not too much sympathy or empathy that goes to the characters i have about the same amount of sympathy for a pedestrian on the street as i do for jason bourne in this movie and instead of adding more dialogue or character development they fill the movie with long unnecessary shots of the locations and scenery they show the characters doing pointless busy work all the time that really doesnt need to be shown on film probably because they couldnt think of anything else to fill the gaps and plus it couldve been over in a half hour its a simple story and they kept it simple and by doing so they made it very boring id say this is without a doubt the slowest action movie ive ever seen but the ending does make you want to come back and see the sequelsso there you have it my final advice is if you havent seen it see it itll be a classic in the world of action movies someday its just a little slow dont watch it with high expectations though like i said its slow should be called the bored identitywith lovesimba jackson,intelligence
or at least thats what i took away from this movie it has all the elements of the spy thriller action movie the guy who cant remember his past the girlfriend the inexplicable relationship between them the rest of the cast almost exclusively white males the car chase the heist the use of gadgetry the ohsocynical political manipulations the relative lack of dialogue and killing after killing after killing weve seen it all before all of itexcepthow people are killed this picture is particularly inventive in its use of violence i cant account for this pictures popularity aside from this one differencemost of the time matt damon looks like hes playing a jedi  he goes through his action sequences without even seeming to breathe he practically looks bored perhaps he feels the force i never thought id say this but tom cruise actually looks like a talented actor in comparison his mission impossible was much the same flick as bourne but had far greater intensity and emotional involvement which brings us back to the creative use of violence i found it ineffective ultimately as it seemed to wrench the viewer out of what little realism is going on perhaps realworld assassins are just that cool how much black leather can you fit in one movie  going out to do the job and never feeling emotional or psychological consequences never using all their creative skills to avoid violence rather than revert to it as a first stepdidnt much care for this picture dont need to see it again,intelligence
this was a pretty dull and overly long actionthriller2 hours of matt damon is just a bit much after all the guy isnt exactly jack nicholson when it comes to acting abilitydamon is pulled aboard a fishing vessel with two bullets in him and no memory of his pasta metal cylinder found on him leads him to a swiss bank to a lock box that has all sorts of alternate ids for him and money and a gunthenfor reasons he doesnt understand people start trying to kill himhe must survive these attempts and battle his way all over europe to try and uncover what is going onthe action parts are pretty good but they are just too far apart and in between them are boring segments of him looking at maps and talking on the phone and driving and all sorts of dull stuffthen its 30 seconds of action and then back to the maps or cell phonenow how he could wake up and not know who he was but remember all sorts of fighting skills and martial arts and expert weapon use was a little cloudyand one glaring mistake that this supposed super agent damon made involved a red canvas bagafter he empties out his swiss lock box he dumps all the stuff in it in a red canvas bagsoon after he is spotted and chased and one of his pursuers goes as far as to yell you with the red bagstop so then what does damons character do he continues to carry this bright red canvas with him through most of the rest of the movie all across europeduh and then i never quite figured out how he was able to roam all across europe and get through and across borders so easily without being nabbed with everyone looking for himanyway im not a big fan of this kind of movieweve seen this spy thriller secret agent stuff done to deathand matt damon was a lackluster choice to play the leadhe had pretty much the same expression on his face the whole moviewhether killing or making loveall in all this 2 hour movie would have been much better to cut out some of the slow parts and keep about 90 minutes worthof course that still doesnt solve the problem of having a dull actor in the lead,intelligence
i have always been a fan of action films and this is a very sophisticated one from director doug liman basically on a stormy night a young man matt damon is pulled out of the mediterranean sea by a fishing boat crew and a curious fisherman pulls out two bullets and miniature laser with a swiss bank account number from his back the young man is now wanting to know who he is going to this bank account in zurich he finds his identification as jason bourne but also underneath the cover he finds more passports with fake names money and a gun he is now following all the clues he has and with the help of tobe love interest marie helena kreutz creeps franka potente they are trying to find out exactly what he did before losing his memory and escaping the attack of the unknown agency assassins obviously we  the audience  know that bad guys led by alexander conklin chris cooper with help from ward abbott brian cox are an organisation called treadstone a secret agency specialising in secret agents jason in the end finds out he was one of these agents with the fateful mission being to kill politician wombosi losts adewale akinnuoyeagbaje before he and marie go into hiding also starring the professor clive owen gabriel mann as zorn and julia stiles as nicolette the acting especially from damon is great the song extreme ways by moby is cool the action and chase sequences are exhilarating it is just an intelligent and energetic film very good,intelligence
the bourne trilogy by robert ludlum is a superb series of booksunfortunately this mediocre film doesnt come close to realising the potential available to the makerswhat possessed the screen writers to turn a completely enthralling story into this dross where is the hunt for carlos the jackal why on earth did they turn marie the canadian economist who plays a major role helping bourne through real difficulties obtaining the money stash into a complete nonentity do they think women are just there for decoration incidentally before you suspect my motive for that comment im a guymarie plays a major role in the book but here she is just a stoogewhat we are left with is a standard hollywood production that depends on a pretty boy male lead and lots of action of course they did throw in a totally ridiculous car chase where would hollywood be nowadays without a completely unbelievable car chase there hasnt been a good one since the rodinpehaps if they had simply called it fred loses his memory it might have stood alone as a moderately interesting film but to ride on the back of the bourne trilogy with this trash is unforgivableforget the bourne films get the books instead the way hollywood has hacked supremacy is even worse would you believe that one is supposed to be about a power struggle in hong kong and china,intelligence
this is the first time i feel the need to react on a movie is a huge dissapointment because it deviates from the book too much it has been a while since ive read the book but no carlos the jackal no marie st claire from france but a marie kreutz from germany and there are more differences i think its an insult for ludlum and his fans,intelligence
having read the ludlum novel only a few months ago i was surprised when i rented the dvd and sat down to watch and realized this movie had little to nothing to do with the book  too bad too  the story ludlum tells was a good one  this movie unfortunately misses the boat entirelymatt damon is too young to portray the main character and the absence of a credible female love interest means this story is relegated to primarily action scenes involving intricate car chases and some well choreographed martial arts scenes  but the reason for the story in the book carlos the jackal reigns terror down on the world at large eludes the viewer   the plot deviation from the book takes place relatively early on and from then on the viewer is left wondering what went wrong  if you never read the book then you wouldnt be missing anything you might just feel the movie was a well planned actionspy dramaim now tempted to go back and find the original 1988 tv drama with richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith perhaps that will fill the void that the 2002 version created in its radical departure from ludlums novel,intelligence
jason bournematt damonis fished out of the drink with two bullet holes in his back and his mind totally blank this young assassin is amazed with his ability in martial arts for selfdefense and his skills in speaking foreign languages his amnesia does not allow him to know what has happened in the last two years but he does know that he has to outrun a large team of assassins in hot pursuit equally puzzling is his possession of a bag of multiple passports and money to burn and what kind of movie would this be without the obligatory feminine charm along the way bourne gets aid from a young womanfranka potentewho also is dealing with a messy lifebeautiful european settings and the exceptional sound effects make the gun play fighting and great car chase extra exciting damon does the role justice and helps make the unbelievable believable other cast members of note are chris cooper gabriel mann and julia stiles miss potente is more viable as the movie progresses thrills chills intrigue and very loud action makes this one among this summers best,intelligence
this film along with enough are what i call litmus test films in my search for movie reviewers on which i can rely i use excruciatingly nodoubtaboutit obviously bad films as litmus tests in my evaluation of reviewers this movie is an excellent test instrumentapart from spectacular views of paris there is very little entertainment in this badly directed movie where everything seems to be out of sync   in a negative way it is everything oo7 films were notmark the reviewer you made out listthe lady from the washington post dasson you are forever off it,intelligence
did not follow the book at all except the fact that jason bourne lost his memory the plot in the book was about a man who loses his memory and tries to find out who he is in his quest he finds out that he is a government agent trying to catch an international assassin named carlos he was following the trail of carlos and he took the credit for carlos assassinations so he could draw carlos out and make carlos come after him so he could catch him the movie strayed far from the book jason bourne was not a part of a group of assassins working for the government the director of this movie is an idiot he got away with changing the plot because robert ludlum was dead when he made the movie if robert ludlum were alive when he made this movie the director would have been fired shame on that idiot,intelligence
for the first time i watched bourne identity years years ago it was just another action thriller like watch and be entertained to me it is so weird and sad that the rating of identity 77 is higher than the rating of supremacy which is unusual and astonishing with amazing action scenes bourne identity is a well made and engrossing action thriller but ordinary and forgettable the only success of the movie is that despite the story is clich a spy who loses his memory tries to remember his past and identity while struggling with other spies who try to kill him the movie does not make you feel this the relationship between him and the girl seems clich always our hero finds a girl or a girl finds him but in my opinion it was realistic so no problem wih it in terms of action the movie is not slow paced but there are two three action scenes including a well but not cool or fresh car chase thats why it is forgettable therefore if you want an engrossing thriller you are not disappointed but if you expect a solid action movie or lots of action it becomes a big disappointment the most and may be only astonishing thing was clive owen so his character to me he adds zest to the movie and there is one thing at the final part that i havent forgotten since that year it was a brilliant action moment which we had not seen a similar one before,intelligence
i knew nothing of the the bourne books written by robert ludlum but i like spy thrillers and thought it would be worth a look and i have to say i was quite disappointed it starts intriguing with a man called jason bourne found shot on a fishing boat way out to see who wakes knowing nothing about himself his name or past life and ends up being pursued by assassins as he tries to find out about himselfoverall the story of the film is quite complicated to understand and may need re seeing twice but even then you like me may lose your interest in anything thats going on another criticism is that there is too much plot with very little action attached throughout the movie as a whole becomes long winded particularly clocking at two hoursmatt damon as bourne im afraid fails to impress he seems far too normal with the situation hes in there are not many emotive qualities to attach in particular when he falls for maria played by franka potente there relationship fails to convince really and the aura of damon being physically diminutive makes him unconvincing as an assassin hired by the ciahowever the supporting cast like clive owen as a hitman and brian coxchris cooper and juila stiles as cia operatives make the most of there roles the action what there was entertaining it was well shot and to be fair the film is just setting up the story for the next two parts which i fear though will be equally disappointing its a decent effort on the whole but it just wasnt good enough,intelligence
this is one of those classic spy thriller movies except bourne is not really a spywhat is he i really dont knowthis film is well directed and the actors doing a good jobim a fan of matt damon but im afraid that this film wont do much for his career he should have picked a better script no offence to the book though as it could only be better than the script ill read it laterif you like car chases stunts and action scenes you will like this film however i dont enjoy the chase just for the sake of it too little background information is given the storyline remains vaguebourne fails to shoot the african dictator in exile because his children are hanging about how unbelievable is this for an highly trained better than james bond type of agent think terrorists have children too does this make them an illegitimate target where is the rest of the storythe idea about an agent recovering from amnesia sounds really interesting to me its just too sad that in this film the whole storyline never recovers from it,intelligence
it is evident that robert ludlums passing came not by the natural aging process but from an advance screening of this adaptation of his most successful novel  fortunately he gets to enjoy the wonders of the afterlife and we are burdened by yet another movie that wastes our time and money and fills up our consciousness with its marketing ad nauseum  not every movie adaptation of a book will mimic the source entirely but this doesnt even come close the only common links that this movie has are the name jason bourne and that he has lost his memory of his life as an assassin i dont even see how it can carry the title if it has nothing else of the meat of the story  where is carlos the assassin bournes adversary whom bourne was trained to go after  where is marie st jacques who was bournes shield and hostage and who at first tried turning in bourne repeatedly before trying to help him learn who he really was  where is david webb who took on the persona of jason bourne to lure out carlos  clearly if youre a fan of the books dont expect this to be anything like themso if you cant expect the movie to mimic the books then you can at least hope that the movie in general is entertaining  sadly its sluggish like molasses  and as i knew from the day they cast him matt damon is no jason bourne let alone an international assassin  and the makeup department didnt do well enough to cover his pimples  but damon is a big draw for the prepubescent girls who drool over his natural good looks which seem to propel him to stardom since he has no natural acting ability  but you cant really blame him since the direction and dialogue really didnt seem to provide him any chances to prove himself as an actor  he had a moment or two where i began to believe he was in character  the movie should have moved you along swiftly but there seemed to be a lot of pot holes along the waybourne was a coldblooded killer and yet one who had vulnerabilities he couldnt quite keep repressed  matt couldnt seem to bring out the cold or the warmth of the character  he just seemed lukewarm  i think the only redeeming quality of the movie was that it closed any doors to a sequel but this is hollywood theyll find any way to make a sequel no matter how bad the first right mr lucas,intelligence
ibid the attonlitus in quebec reviewif the movie was supposed to be based on the book of the same name my 2 rating is too highjason bourne fans from the books have come to appreciate him as a bad dude matt damon is about as bad as my poodle i understand this movie had lots of problems and it shows  in short the folks who liked the book should avoid this thing like the plague  however my wife didnt read the book and she didnt find it all that bad  one ok thing was franka potente who plays marie kreuntz who ever that issure not in the book anywhere i wonder if she had been given  a character like the heroine of the book would she have been up to it  i sort of think so  make her a red head and give her a bit of a canadian accent andi know this is way short of how lame this thing is for real jason bourne fans  lame  lame   lame,intelligence
until i noticed that the reason he is able to kill the other expert assassin is because the other assassin kills the family dog for no apparent reason this is too big of a plot hole for me to swallow otherwise the movie is great the action scenes are amazing and the pace is really good,intelligence
i wasnt aware that i had less than 24 hours to watch a purchased video paid 299 for about an halfhour of video before being interrupted and then asked to pay again,intelligence
the story was ok but it wasnt very exciting and it didnt keep me that intrigued the action scenes were good they couldve been longer and probably shouldve been more of those types of scenes in the movie one of the problems with this movie is that its not very thrilling compared to other assassin movies likes john wick i felt like the movie had a dull tone to it,intelligence
this movie lacks some new current technologies and lacks better explanation story is obviously incomplete and not fully understood we can predict that there will be newer sequel based on so quick finish and new characters appearing at the end taken 2008 is better than this one because it has better explanation and content is newer updated for at least a decade so it makes movie look more real for our current perspective bit too much action and too little mystery and too much boring unnecessary details like expected reactions talk relationship between two main characters interesting beginning positive ending but everything in the middle is too quick with holes in the story and more boring had middle been like beginning it would be much better,intelligence
ive wondered for years why i never managed to watch bourne identity in its entirety now having sat down and forced myself i now understand im sorry it might be a realistic spy movie but it has serious pacing issues,intelligence
matt damons character is hunted because reasons if they had just left him alone he wouldnt have bothered anyone and wouldve just lived his life the way he did at the end and i guess the reason the lemming who fights him in the apartment jumps to his death is so that that there can be some kind of mystery i fight with assassins but i wonder who i am because i have amnesia conveniently,intelligence
was directed by doug liman stars matt damon franka potente and chris cooper and is the story of a manmatt damon who is found stranded in the ocean with no knowledge of who he is the only things he can remember are his enhanced ability to kill as events unfold he discovers who he is and why he why he didnt know who he wasi went into this movie with skyrocketed expectations that may have tainted my viewing but i just dont understand the sheer praise sent this movies way sure damon was pretty good and the action was pretty entertaining but aside from that there is little more enjoyment to be found here the bourne disappointment contains enough to be watchable but not enough to the point i can recommend it damon is to be fair pretty good as the star character but i dont think its the role he should be remembered for the action is also decent but it doesnt hold to the standard that ive heard so many people praise it for if you enjoy this movie fine but dont come to me and praise it as a gritty realistic spy thriller that changed action movies because it just isnt its fineright the story for this movie has a genuine level of intrigue and i can understand it is more grounded in reality than say bond or mission impossible that said i dont think that it is interesting enough to make it better than what it is while the story is fine its not great and could have been done much better especially considering the concept pretty disappointing to be honestagain matt damon is the only genuinely great thing in this movie for me i dont think it should be the role people recognise him for but i do genuinely buy both the confused side of his character and the badass side of his character franke potente was on the other hand awful as marie krutz she was more wooden than a tree and possessed no likable or redeeming qualities that made me care in any way one thing this movie was praised for is the chemistry between bourne and krutz how where is their chemistry an ant and the heel of my sneaker have more chemistry jesus and judas have better chemistry than these two hitler and a homosexual jewish man have better chemistry they have no chemistry and i challenge you to prove me otherwise chris cooper existed and was there the villain was very weaktechnically speaking this movie was fine the use of shaky cam and limans breaking of things such as the 180 rule definitely benefited this movie and sold the idea of realism and grittiness the effects were also fine but thankfully they werent used consistentlyi do like how neither usthe audience or bourne actually understand the character of bourne i think the dynamic of that is clever and works well in the context of the movie in conclusion this movie is honestly just average some action is good and damon was good as bourne but i just cant see enough substance to keep this movie better than what it is i dont think it deserves the immense praise it gets and i think its fine i dont recommend it but if you like it than i guess i do envy you for seeing something i just cannot410,intelligence
this movie begins with some fishermen in the meditterean sea recovering a body they see floating in the water when they pull the unconscious man matt damon aboard the boat they realize that he is alive and has two bullet holes in his back after treating his wounds the man awakens but doesnt know who he is or any events from his past fortunately one particular piece of evidence found upon him has an account number for a bank in zurich which the man immediately proceeds to check out when he finally gets to shore upon opening the bank deposit box the man discovers several passports under different names a large stack of money in various currencies and a gun he takes everything but the gun and decides to use the name of jason bourne from the american passport he then proceeds to the american embassy in zurich and discovers that for some reason he is wanted by almost all of the law enforcement agencies in europe and the united states he also discovers that he is especially adept with guns and handtohand combat now rather than reveal any more i will just say that the overall story was acquired from a book of the same title which was written by robert ludlum and used in a previous miniseries in 1988 with richard chamberlain in the main role unlike the miniseries however this particular film has better action and more suspense which results in a slightly better movie in my opinion it is also followed by several sequels which are quite enjoyable as well,intelligence
few could have expected the affect doug limans adaptation of robert ludlums novel would have on action cinema and on the career of star matt damon when it was released back in 2002 this wellcrafted relatively lowkey action thriller takes the donetodeath spywithamnesia story and runs with it avoiding the lure of throwing in michael bayesque explosions and wisely keeping things grounded as shady government types in dull black suits stare at computer monitors and make demands to their younger cronies that they have the information they require yesterday in the mediterranean sea a fishing vessel picks up a man near death with two bullet holes in his back the onboard doctor tends to his wounds and pulls a small device from his hip which reveals a swiss bank account number when activated the man has no memory of who he is and so heads to zurich to recover a safe deposit box that contains multiple identities a wad of cash in different currencies and a gun he opts to go by the name on his american passport jason bourne but soon finds himself chased by a shadowy agency called treadstone seemingly led by the ruthless conklin chris cooper evading capture at the american embassy he pays pretty german lady marie franka potente to drive him to paris in the hope of discovering who he is and who is after himjason bourne can now be spoken in the same breath as james bond and in fact makes the british superspy seem ridiculous in comparison especially the pierce brosnan incarnation bourne is infinitely more interesting because he is conflicted tortured by a past of mass murder and seeking to make amends for his actions while the action scenes thrill in a refreshingly unspectacular way its bournes tender relationship with marie that generate the most sparks potente is lovely in the role and her naturalism and chemistry with damon is the films biggest positive and there are smart turns from cooper and brian cox as the grumpy old agency men and clive owen as a deadeyed fellow assassin while it may pale in comparison to the barraising paul greengrass sequels identity is still a nifty thriller with characters to actually care about,intelligence
its taken me a while to get round to watching this the genre is not really me but when i was offered the dvd for the giveaway price of 39p it seemed churlish to refuse i havent read the book  like i said the genre is not one i can work up a sweat about  so i had no expectations to cause disappointment after a slow start it picked up the tempo by the third reel grabbed you by the throat and refused to let go albeit formulaic  the one about the fugitive who picks up an obligatory female companion to share his travails goes back at least as far as the thirty nine steps which is about as timehonoured as they come and franka potente is just far enough off the wall to be interesting certainly entertains for at least an initial viewing,intelligence
i dont consider this to be the absolute epitome of spy action movies but it does have some things that many spy movies do not the most prominent of these is an internal conflict many spy movies make an attempt at internal goals but most of these involve underdeveloped love interests and even bourne is not entirely exempt from this however his main internal goal is to discover who he is the way it balances out is great because he wants to renounce his former life as an assassin but that doesnt mean he isnt willing to use his awesome skills to do so it seems a little contradictory to escape a life of violence by means of violence but its a lot more believable than many of the other peaceloving action heroes that movies have featuredthe form of amnesia that bourne has is a little too convenient and is not unique to this movie as weve seen it featured in the two most recent fast and furious movies 6 and 7 from what i know of the book i think we only see bournes point of view but it was good that they show some of the story from the perspective of clonkin and the treadstone division a lot of what goes on within treadstone is a little confusing but its okay because all we really care about is how it impacts jason bourne and that usually becomes pretty evident soon afterward some of the story is just driven by the audiences desire to see bourne fight paid guns with skillful and brutal technique but we end up caring about him finding himself and protecting marie as well its not boring when there isnt a fight scene going on like some action moviesjason bourne is a likable character because hes a human wrecking machine but hes emotional as well and you can sympathize with him this is shown with the help of his companion marie its true that her and bourne ending up together is as expected and unlikely as in any other movie but at least marie has personality and actually likes jason rather than just falling for him inexplicably like a bond girl there isnt as much development from our numerous antagonists which include wombosi clonkin and his staff and the various unnamed people that bourne has to fight they mostly exist to drive the plot rather than create any real conflict additionally i felt like the scenes with the antagonists were some of the worst executed they featured dialogue and computerstyle cinematography that is very generic to spy movies it wasnt necessarily bad but it felt like it didnt belong in this kind of movie where its more a battle of wits and skills than of technology and gadgetsthis brings us to the action scenes i thought the car chases were well done which unfortunately cannot be said of the bourne supremacy the handtohand combat is very fast paced with tons of shot cuts to emphasize how superior bourne is to most of the people he fights they are well choreographed and have some original touches to them like bourne using a ballpoint pen to fight one of his foes matt damon gives a performance that surpasses what one usually expects from someone in his role the same goes for franka potente in the role of marie the script is decent as is the directing and camreaworkif youre looking for just an action movie this will be satisfactory but it has more to offer than action still you probably wont enjoy it if you are averse to spy or action movies in general if you liked the novel ill just say that from what ive heard the movie seems to deviate enough from the book that it might be disappointing for you so if you decide to watch it enjoy but be prepared to pay more than normal attention overall rating 8210,intelligence
is quite fun and faced paced but really thats the only thing that makes this film watchable the storyline is nothing new whilst the cat and mouse chasing sequences even though epic and thrilling have been done to death however even though riddled with action movie clichs does set itself apart from other films like it with fantastic acting and a new spin on the secret agent ideaeven though could very well of been another james bond movie it does have some individuality about it whilst not everything is perfect in this film it is a good one to watch if you need a bit of cheesy hollywood action in your life,intelligence
is the first film in the bourne franchise it follows jason bourne a man who is trying to figure out who he is after he is found floating at sea with gunshot wounds on his back he doesnt remember basically anything about his life so we follow him on his journey to discover who he isand this movie got many things right it establishes the character of jason bourne very well and we root for him we want him to win so the movie gets that very right the thing that moves this movie is pretty much the intrigue we have in finding out who jason bourne really is matt damon is great as the character but i think the directing and cinematography could have been betternot to say they were bad i just think a main problem the movie has is that it should have packed a meaner punch few but some scenes feel a little bland and that shouldnt happen in an action movie another big issue i have with the film is another thing that should never happen in an action flick that is that the movie feels uneven at times not from a story standpoint but from a speed point of view what i mean is the movie moves very fast at times but sometimes way too slow and this isnt really balancedin the end i enjoyed although i think the movie could and should have hit harder and been better,intelligence
2002 dir doug liman  cast matt damon franka potente chris cooper julia stiles clive owen exhilarating remake about self discovery that hardly translates as decent entertainment a wounded body is found at sea but he isnt aware of who he is so he assumes the identity of jason bourne he can also speak several languages and beat the tar out of people he pays a woman a sum of money to drive him from danger interesting setup becomes one violent scene after another director doug liman proves that he can handle action right down to the corrupt conclusion he previously made a much better film in go matt damon mirrors bournes amnesia and paranoia but he is reduced to constant combat franka potente serves no purpose other than to be a potential sex partner chris cooper is also reduced to a standard role and julia stiles are wasted clive owen would go on to become a rather successful action star but here he basically plays a role billed as the professor the film exists as entertainment but as such it substitutes intelligence for numerous violent encounters and variations of martial arts fights that seem to go on forever this is the first of several books surrounding the bourne character but hopefully all of them wont be translated to screen this poorly themes of identity and ability overshadowed by pointless violence in this overrated dog show score 4  10,intelligence
i remember how i loved when it first came out the plot the action i thought everything was great about this film was riveting but then i saw it again and i dozed off for a little bitthe film doesnt really holds up today but weirdly enough the plot and the action is style good the fight scenes and the stunts are still impressive today but the sound effects are kinda bad it actually put me off of the fight scenes this time around how come punches sounded like that in movies back then and how the hell was i ok with it it took me out of the story and i struggled to get back in itas distracting as the sound effects are in the film has a good cast matt damon is amazing in that role completely believable as this amnesiac dude who knows all of these thing the story is simple but efficient as are the action scenes it has a james bondsy flavor that is if james bond was on a budget which gives a gritty realistic feel to the moviehas its quirks but its a rather entertaining filmby wornoutspines,intelligence
who doesnt like a good thriller once in a while were sadly bound to hollywood providing cheap films in our local multiplex when the word thriller comes to mind its the independent hits with an appreciation for reality that make you grasp at the edge of our seats the birth of a soon to be fivefilm franchise is so far the most lame and lifeless all the necessities for a successful film both in qualitative and financial terms are at the edge of the producers of noses based loosely on robert ludlums novel is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fishermen who nurse him back to wellness he can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as the swiss bank account the number of which is implanted in his hip familiar territory anyone he soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with a girl on a search to find out who he is and why he is being hunted the whole identity crisis element gets tangled into so many films that dont even require the film to be good we spend money on films to excite us and since producers writers and directors know how to make easy films that can please audiences based on financial data they throw the same baloney at us relies on an identity crisis nothing is thrilling exciting or even the slight most interesting every second feels like a bedtime story kids beg to end to fall asleep director doug liman can do pretty fun things in wildly entertaining blockbusters but he kind of just tells his crew to make sure the sound is loud and the camera is still the whole films plays like the sound on a medical machine that stimulates the knowledge that a guy died you follow i asked too many rhetorical questions due to how repetitive the dullness carries on in the film itself,intelligence
is an excellent actionthriller that keeps you watching even when it slows down in pace it is similar to bond movies but with one major difference  its got a very good plot  story to itmatt damon is perfect in the role of jason bourne and franka potente as marie  his somewhat unfortunate partner in crime  is good without ever becoming annoying this is definitely a movie you need to pay attention to because in parts the story moves along almost as fast as the action and if you dont keep up then it can be easy to get lost on whats happening that is in no way a bad thing though as it gives you that want to see what happens next feeling the movie does slow down in some parts but even when that happens the movies plotline still ticks along nicely without it ever getting boringa movie very much recommended,intelligence
this is the kind of action movie that always seems believable other action movies usually have some kind of weird gadget or an over the top over blown action sequence with some kind of scheme to blow up the moon or melt the polar ice caps none of that is in this movie the action scenes are good but theyre believable there arent many strange or amazing gadgets in this movie in fact there arent any gadgets at all this is the plot a man matt damon is found by italian fishermen riddled with bullets off the coast of marseille france he is picked up and discovers that he is suffering from amnesia he cant remember who he is or what he did but he does know that he possesses a number of unusual skills he travels to zurich switzerland where he receives a number of passports all with his picture but with different names and nationalities he takes the name jason bourne meanwhile in the united states cia director alexander conklin chris cooper is talking about a failed attempt to assassinate nigerian dictator nykwana wombasi adewale akinnuoyeagbaje and that jason was responsible for it failing they go to arrest him in zurich meanwhile jason goes to the state us embassy in zurich but us marines recognize him the marines attempt to arrest him but he escapes he meets a woman named marie kreutz franka potente that he offers 10000 to if she drives him to paris france she reluctantly accepts marie is suspicious of jason for obvious reasons jason still does not know who he is and tells this to marie when they get to paris they visit jasons assumed house when they are there a cia agent breaks in and attempts to arrest jason and marie they know realize that they are wanted under another identity john michael kane jason finds out documents about the night that an attempt on wombasis life was made he finds out that an assassin was escaping off of wombasis boat when a secret serviceman shot him twice in the back afterwards jason and marie go to the french countryside and take refuge in maries friend eamons tim dutton house to stay away from the cia a cia assassin clive owen attempts to kill jason but he defeats him he then tells marie and eamon to leave the house to stay away from any further danger jason confronts conklin and another agent named nicky parsons julia stiles who sent the assassin and conklin tells jason that he was the assassin whose mission it was to kill wombasi but he didnt because his children were in the room jason escapes and conklin is killed by another agent jason meets up with marie in greece and the two are united this is a really good well thought out action movie that doesnt feature over the top action scenes that you usually find in other movies of this genre i highly recommend it,intelligence
succeeds where many action films fail in that it keeps its action grounded yet entertaining there are no huge explosions or entire city blocks being leveled just for the sake of looking cool and pandering to the action junkies among the viewers suffice to say itd be more accurate to call this film an action thriller as far as mood and style goand its a really good action thriller the mystery of jason bournes matt damon memory loss is interesting the locations are varied the characters and their actors do a credible job of pulling us into their world the action feels suitably heavy and threatening and as a whole the story is told well with captivating pacingi also really like matt damon and franka potente together in this film they have instant chemistry together but its never overplayed they get to know each other along the way but always at the terms of the larger action taking place around them this feels more realistic than many other action couples where they seem ready to jump each others bones at a moments noticeas a whole is a peculiar action classic its downplayed and even minimalistic but its shot and told so well that even hardcore action fans wont complain easily worth a watch,intelligence
this movie is almost as good as teen wolf i give it a 9 out of 10 but not the show teen wolf the original 80s movie with michael j fox if i had to guess they probably wanted michael j fox for the lead roll of this movie but he was unavailable but thats ok because this movie is still almost as good as teen wolf there is suspense there is comedy and there is sexual tension witch is everything this story needs except for a young warewolf shooting hoops and freestyle break dancing now if you know anything about this movie you know that the protagonist is something of a barber well teen wolf deals with his fair share of salon quality hair too,intelligence
i came to this after a difficult viewing of a film about the psychologic nature of truth how memory governs a story looking to replenish myself with something similar but more straightforward it felt good to be back within comfort zonesit wasnt a spy film by accident a genre that is in a deeper sense all about how we witness things my yardstick of an effective spy film is how much of the spying is left to the viewer and how much is pieced for his amusement how difficult it is to stay tethered to a shifting order of thingshere were so very comfortably tethered on the boat we learn that he has no memory and it probably wont come back one of the very first scenes is immediately in langley so we know hes cia we quickly know about the specific mission hes tracked makes an escape video game opponents are activated to find him i want jason bourne in a bodybag by sundown back in langley great fights and car chasesmost of the dialogue in crucial moments is so that we know exactly whats going on so we share some of bournes uncertainty about the deeper reasons yet at the same time know much more than he does as we switch back and forth from his situation to the larger plot obviously it would be a much riskier film if we were called to fathom the larger mechanics from his pov alone but for tonight it worked for me finedamon would be completely wrong for this except his hardened spy is given to us via his wideeyed boyish persona so we follow an ordinary american youth who might as well have been backpacking across europe who is assailed by paranoid perceptions looking out for exit doors etc whose body is at crucial moments suddenly possessed by another self who preexists in a different narrativei liked that they put him next to an ordinary girl with a beatup old mini worrying about a visa it draws out this boy in his late20s who would have all the time to fall in love while hitching a ride to paris but for this previous narrative of political wrongdoingin the end the son turns against the irascible father played by cooper and channeling american beauty the son was a filmmaker there here hes struggling to piece an inner film he meets the girl in an island its all so childishly simple around that commentaryi have the feel ill be able to enjoy this again in the future as a north by northwest popup without any baggage of cinematic mastery attached,intelligence
think about it the books were loosely based on the romanticized life and works of carlos the jackal and while a masterpiece in literature in my opinion it revolved more around jason bourne it was a psychological thriller and remained a classic for that reasonso for obvious reasons they couldnt adapt the movie directly from the book the several names are there and people are there but most of it had to be modernized and personally i loved the way that they did it the story remained about bourne and how he is clawing his way out of his mind to try and remember anything and everything about his past life not only out of sheer curiosity but because well people are hunting him and he has no idea whywhich is why i give this movie a damn good review everything else they could have tossed out of the window but that psychological part the part that i think most bourne fans will agree was the most crucial and they nailed it to the effing tree marie is there to help the damaged killer to find his human side and realize that not everyone in the world is after him the acting is superb the fight scenes are gritty brutal and realistic the plot if basic is strong and to the point only a few side plots are added and everything is neatly wrapped up at the end,intelligence
this film is simply in my opinion fantastic when i watch an action spy film i believe that apart from the daniel craig james bond films there shouldnt be this idea of cool gadgets smart cars and endless women this is the most appealing part of for me i enjoy action films a lot and with there being no gadgets no real nice cars and only 1 female i got exactly what i wanted matt damon plays jason bourne a disgruntled man who has been shot twice and is rescued with no memory which leads to this story of finding himself damon is solid in this film he is tough when in fights with enemies but shows that he is a human being when treating others allied with him you feel sorry for him in the situation he is in even though he is clearly a dangerous human being he encounters franka potente who plays the character maria who helps him and i believe in this crazy situation the chemistry between the two characters is good and believable with the distressing predicament with the government after them another positive is the fact that this film is mostly based in paris which is nice cause it isnt london or the usa which is refreshing this film is awesome and if you like fighting spy films then this is a must watch film,intelligence
when watching a film for the first time it is necessary to allow yourself to be immersed completely in the story characters and locations this is harder if you have no background information but can be even more rewarding if you commit to it you learn as the characters do and you follow their journey what makes so rewarding therefore is that for once you are on a complete equal with the main character in terms of information  you learn as he doesthe film tells the story of jason bourne matt damon a trained cia assassin who has had his memory wiped and is found by a ships crew floating unconscious in the sea gradually we learn more about him as he does he has a great set of skills which only need to be triggered to be used he has a swiss bank account with a large number of passports all in different names after the cia is notified as to bournes whereabouts they send people to track him down so hes constantly on the run damon is a really fantastic actor and plays bourne in a serious yet connectable way franka potente also does a great job as bournes love interest marie and the chemistry between the two is a really fantastic part of the filmone of the biggest problems with spy films in this day and age is the endless comparison with james bond and the need to be different this is where the film succeeds so well its got gadgets action the girl but treats them in a very different way its more realistic the technology is ever present yet not futuristic and the action sequences are far more stylised and extremely engaging the fight sequences are gripping and the way they are shot reminds you of a martial arts film the chase sequences are frantic and more intimate and its far bleaker than a james bond film more personal and this is possibly all down to damons fantastic characterthe main problem with the film is its plot which is at time difficult to follow however the brilliance of the action sequences often makes up for this its a watchable and enjoyable film with a lot of promise leading into the next instalments in the trilogy,intelligence
believability is subject to many things i try to believe in everything until proved false except politicians this is supposed to be and looked like a realistic modern spy movie and not being a spy or hopefully a baddie i believe in it completely what do i want to know about bloody spies except that this particular spy film entertained me havent any idea or a care whether it followed the book or not this is a movie commenting zoneathletic amnesiac is recovered alive from the sea and gradually pieces his past lives together and works out why the authorities are trying to kill him and the woman he picked up in his flight its slick and expertly told intelligent and extremely concise and swift the two have a violent time racing and dodging about france but ultimately im sure it wouldnt be so easy to escape the clutches of the combined relentless forces of good and eventually even be able to storm the nerve centre singlehanded but really no criticisms are necessary as its so entertaining i dont quite understand why the makers were so worried the events of 911 would instantly date the movie when it was released when some huge pcs are on display and the lack of socalled smartphones would give it all away soon anywayfor years people kept telling me this really was a great film and i should watch it  well they were right its not perfect but thats entertainment,intelligence
matt damon has portrayed the character of jason bourne flawlessly and the viewer watches the whole movie taking shallow breaths watching jason bourne striving hard to get back his forgotten identity acting has never been an issue with matt damon he pleases you some of the others have been good too however some have really failed to captivate the viewer even if it is a sufficiently technical spy movie the emotions with which the filmmakers have wrapped this film gives you a good mixture good enough that you can applaud the effort with both your hands the movie is action packed fighting scenes yes breath taking martial arts yes so finally is this movie awesome  yes,intelligence
the first film from the bourne franchise was the id and stars matt damon as jason who am i bourne some might criticise these films to me as crap because sometimes the plots are a bit silly but they all contain some nice slick action and getaway scenes as bourne seemed to elude capture against several life and death members of some corrupt agencies assembled to catch one man but why do they work alone and want to kill each other and does it make any sense overall as already stated the film has some excellent slick action as an alternative to the james bond series of films it features quirky camera work that makes the film fast paced as bourne makes his getaway in an italian job fashion with the use of a mini without the usual james bond gadgets or fast cars and this is what really appeals to me,intelligence
on the big screen this movie made me sickit wasnt the acting or the music it was the camera work it was like someone strapped the camera to their head drank fifteen beers and then ran naked across a football fieldeach stumble makes the camera jerk left or right and my eyes roll back in my head it was really hard to concentrate on seeing the eyes of the actors because every time i would focus the shot would start getting bumpy and id want to curl into a ballthe story is that theres a guy who cant remember who he is but he knows hes someonehe just has to put the pieces together in that sense its an enjoyable watch,intelligence

like it or not this is the reinvention of the super spy movie it came before the new james bond series and probably had more than a passing influence this is not great art or even great movie making it is however that thing that is the minimum of expectations in the most popular of popular culture entertaining and rewardingamnesia in the hero is always an interesting ploy as we discover along with the character new and cool things super soldier spy is another fictional stalwart that just always seems to work despite the whiskers and the been there done that factorso we have a highbudget slick actioner with some modern sensibilities read frantic editing and shaky camera and an affable young movie star brought out to kick start a new wave of popcorn purchases and home theatre inclusions if the movie has a weakness it is the off again on again female sidekick that becomes a bit irritating fluctuating from strong willed helper to befuddled reluctant participant this all seems tacky and tackedon for obvious reasonsthe newest thing here is perhaps the most intriguing that being the nsa surveillance and cia goosestepping that is very disturbing with the technology at hand to invade privacy with a keystroke it should leave viewers just a bit queasy even more so today than in 2002 in this regard the movie was more than a little prophetic,intelligence

bourne identity is not only a good movie but its easily the best bourne movie ive ever seen granted i dont recall much of the chamberlain bourne from 1980s but out of all these new ones including bourne legacy i clearly like this one the most here are the reasons why1 this is easily the most emotionally appealing jason bourne out of all three of this trilogy there is more depth and sincerity in his struggles and he isnt yet too seasoned and determined as he is in the sequels matt damon gives a very good performance2 this movie focuses on the essential it isnt trying to be smarter than it is this isnt a movie about cia spy programs and conspiracies as much as it is about jason bourne this approach makes the movie more relatable more exciting and more effective in every way3 wonderful cast casting was never a problem in the sequels either but i like the actors in this one the most clive owen chris cooper franka potente good job from each and every one of them4 execution i love most of the scenes in this movie for two reasons they are just long enough to tell you that certain part of the story and maintain the suspense  never longer when theres action its not only exciting but you actually see whats happening example one confrontation with clive owens character it doesnt really take that long but its effective and suspenseful from start to finish it doesnt get tedious or repetitive and it tells you every bit of the story you need to know maximum effectiveness example two the fight scene in the apartment its inventive and exciting but not only that you see whats going on while the sequels went a little crazy with the shakycam this one includes enough shots from steady different angles to a keep you in the middle of the action and b let you see the big picture as well this is easily one of the best fight scenes ive ever seen even if the sound effects are a little overblown 5 violence im not a gore fan but these are not nor should they be kids movies some of the action really has an impact on you when someone gets hurt you feel itthats pretty much it this is simply an effective movie its paced perfectly the cast is wonderful action is thrilling and the more personal focus on the main character seals the deal the sequels never came even close theyre not as bad as their hideous visual style greengrass hates my eyes but they chose the path of messier and less appealing storytelling tedious action and general shallowness soundtrackwise the sequels got the upper hand in my mind but thats it im not exactly a fan of director doug liman but he did such a fine job with this film and i wouldve wanted him to direct the sequels tooim writing this review now because i just got this movie in a bluray format universal 100th anniversary something edition and i thought i might as well write a review even though ive had this film on dvd for many years id like to compliment the product itself this is how blurays should be made straight from the menus you know that theres been some effort plenty of stuff bonuses and extras too,intelligence
i must admit up front that i am a hard sell for films like while its a very well made film its also the sort of genre that i am not drawn towards as i just dont love nonstop action many doso keep this in mindthe film begins very welland very stylishly a man is found floating in the mediterraneanalmost dead a doctor on board the ship examines him and finds very bizarre thingstwo bullet holes in the body as well as a strange device implanted in the mans thigh clearly he is no ordinary guy however the moribund man awakensand is clearly a guy not to be trifled with as hes nearly dead but still a killing machine but here is the odd partthe machine has no idea who he is how he got there or where to go next the film that follows consists of jason bourne learning who he isall the while practically everyone is chasing him and trying to kill him the film is one chase scene after anotherall well done but also a bit tiring for me again you may not feel this wayif you adore nonstop action and suspense youll probably like this wellmade thriller as for me it did not leave me wanting to see any of the sequelsit was good but enough for a lifetime of actionsuspense for me as for me i just want more story and less mayhem,intelligence
i was a bit disappointed by this film expected a thicker plot more twists and more locations instead the plot remains pretty thin and thus gets stretched out storywise there isnt enough material for a 2 hour film also there are virtually no twists and the locations arent all that exciting it feels very much like a setup for a larger franchise and cant stand on its own feetthe two leads lack a distinctive image even though i liked matt damons presence chris cooper delivers an excellent performance as an aggressive alpha male clive owen also boasts and exceeds damons performance without even doing a whole lot,intelligence

its been awhile since i saw bourne so i played it again and it still rocked i didnt recall much of the movie only that i enjoyed it enough to buy the dvd the movie has a great raw feel to it really adding the perfect element to this whole who am i feel throughout the movie matt damon plays his role as the amnesia filled jason bourne very well in my opinion hes wound up tightly enough that every little comment about his past gets to him and he then goes and takes out his anger out on everything the cia throws at him all the elements add together to make a great movie the camera work the scenes the colors and especially the soundtrackit was all definitely thought out perfectlyon the whole id give this film somewhere near a 82510but for round numbers sake ill drop it down to 8 for this enjoyable action film i hope the bourne ultimatum is just as good,intelligence
its funny how summer movies play out over time i vividly remember the big tentpole releases of 2002 spiderman attack of the clones road to perdition minority report and none of them hold up for me as well as it was a gamble back then to cast matt damon in the lead role even though liman  co clearly spun the bourne novels into something else of their own but it pays off damon is fully up to the task and brings his a game belying his freshfaced looks and convincingly brings a lethal spy to life it also helps that hes backed by chris cooper and brian cox but he deserves loads of credit the beauty of this thing is that it just doesnt seem to lose steam bournes always moving and therefore so are we whether hes trading fists or bullets playing spiderman on the side of a building or tearing up the streets of paris in a welldone car chase with a great song choice but even in the quiet scenes the mystery continues to deepen and our attention is never adrift and this was before greengrass hyperactive editing took over in the sequels that takes skill the movies got plenty going for it the car chase the fight scenes the rapport between damon and potente the seething rage in cooper beautiful locations and the occasional sense that anything can happen indeed shockingly brutal fight scenes solid spyaction movie and allaround entertaining7510,intelligence
this is a movie where lines between simple movie and reality might be blurred there are some movies that are based on fact or hits close enough to home that it makes people who were actually in those situations cringe this movie might be one of themthis movie to matt damon is like what matrix was for kianuu reeves matt damon made good movies but this might be his defining role mind controlled super agent finds himself lost in gernany without memory of who he is or why hes there the story runs very close to the declassified mk ultra program that us government was conducting to create super soldiers in fact one of the soldiers that came out of this program says he cant watch this movie because it disturbs him too muchthe movie is luke warm interesting and the believability of matt damon as a super soldier is very low so while this movie may hit close to home for some it doesnt hit me at all in fact it was kind of boring and is not recommended for viewing,intelligence
this has nothing to do with the book written by ludlum the movie is not so bad but why is it announced as based on the novel ridiculous the only things based on the novel are some of the characters names all three of the bourne movies are just about totally ignoring the plot of the books which annoyed me greatly because when i read that the movie is based on the novel i expected it to be the tv adaptation from 1988 with richard chamberlain is much more closer to the book so if you are a fan of the novel you would probably like the old movie better because in the it they mostly stuck to the book with few variations,intelligence

2002  out of 4nice thriller has a man matt damon being pulled from the ocean with two gunshot wounds to the back as well as suffering from amnesia over the course of time his memory slowly starts to come back but hes dodging countless assassins sent to kill him wth the help of a woman franka potente he tries to figure out his true identity didnt completely win me over but theres no question that its a well crafted thriller that makes perfect use of its star i think its easy to see damon in this role because he can not only handle the action scenes but he can also perfectly work through the more dramatic moments of the story there are several scenes where the character pretty much cracks from not being able to remember who he is and damon managed to make these scenes seem very real another major plus is that hes just so good in the action scenes im not sure how many people knew damon would be able to pull this off but the transition to an action star worked it took me a while to warm up to potente shes certainly got a different look and style than youd normally see in a movie like this and thats one thing i did enjoy once the story picked up and her character got more involved i thought the actress managed to come out of her shell the supporting cast includes a nice turn by chris cooper who is also dependable i think one of the films biggest pluses was the beautiful location shooting theres footage from across the world and it really helped add to the story add in some nice action scenes and a pretty good if easy to follow story and youre left with an entertaining antijames bond film,intelligence

is a good action film the action scenes were fast paced and gripping the love interest which develops as the film progresses was well done brian cox and the other cia men were wonderfully shady and full of the wrong intentionsthe problem is that it lacks the greengrassian touch it is quite difficult to put your finger on it but lacks something that the greengrass films have perhaps its the more defined use of handheld camera in the bourne supremacyultimatium perhaps its the fast paced soundtrack i feel that at certain points in the film it loses momentum it is probably about 20 minutes too long and i could have done without all of the shots of him walking down streets and close ups of his face when hes driving et al the remarkable thing about the greengrass films is that they are so crisp and tight it keeps the movie flowing at a good pace and keeps the viewer interested in the narrative somewhere along the line you just feel lacks thisit is a good film and sets up the other sequels nicely but it lacks something that the other films have  the greengrassian touch,intelligence
for any of you who have watched any or all of this series and left scratching your head and wondering why you didnt follow the plot  well youre not to be blamed how gilroy could have written not one but three consecutive screenplays without a single mention of carlos the jackal astounds even a jaded movie watcher like meif you who dont know who carlos the jackal was hes a real character  ilich ramirez sanchez  from recent history who was just sentenced to life in prison again on 16 dec 2011 about 10 days ago then you cant possibly know who jason bourne is nor the very reason for his existence and the entire point behind this outstanding ludlum serieswhy would a screenwriter completely strip the core out of three books bourne coming to an understanding of how he had been created by the agency and his growing awareness of the true nature of his mission would have only added to this film why oh why was anything of importance to understanding the plot excised does gilroy harbor secret feelings of respect for the hitman character of carlos and was he embarrassed to actually write this character into the script as a villain surely hollywood hasnt drifted that far too the left however i can offer no other explanation gilroy isnt usually this ineptthat said even damon criticized the installment previous to legacy along with sanchez resentencing damon this last week delivered his own sentence upon gilroy for his writing skills damon advised gq magazine that the script that gilroy had delivered for the bourne ultimatum was unreadable damon reported that this is a careerender i mean i could put this thing up on ebay and it would be game over for that dude its terrible its really embarrassing he was having a go basically and he took his money and left so perhaps gilroy really is that inept,intelligence
i will admit the action is great but this movie moves too slowly at times and is just boring matt damon has some great acting in this but hes the only one whos acting satisfies me also if you are a fan of ludlums bourne books you might come out disappointed because this has little to no connection to the original books this is also a good thing because the filmmakers are able to adapt the book into a modern day setting almost flawlessly and as i said before the action is great but there is not enough of it in this movie and the shaky camera does start to get a bit annoying however despite all of my negative comments i would strongly recommend watching this because both of the sequels to this movie and absolutely amazing and you might get a little lost without this movie overall i didnt like this movie but i stuck through with it because of its good sequels,intelligence
very good movie once again matt has proved that he is incomparable in actingthe back ground sound is too goodworth to spend hours to watch this thrillerit definitely worth for 1010compared to reading the novel this gives different picture of the moviecomparing to the imaginary 007 spy movies this movies gives a different thought  opinion on spy movies though the storyline has appeared in other spy movies the screenplay is awesome and it proves this one is different from all other spy moviesworth watching,intelligence
i like thrillers this was an actionpacked thriller that held my attention i had wanted to see this for a number of years it seems like it has only been recently that i have spotted it on the tube until then only the sequels were shown i have something about watching series in sequencei thought the premise was a bit forced i dont really understand why we wanted to get rid of bourne to begin with just because a hit went bad is a reason to kill him other than that it was a fine movielots of action good visualsit seems like bourne is akin to a modern day james bond,intelligence
as a standalone film this still works very well the action scenes brief and scattered as they may be are very well done and mostly grounded especially by hollywood standards its not quite as smart as it would like you to believe but remains intelligent enough to avoid becoming a stereotypically brainless puncher and i enjoyed the constantlyflipping roles of the ongoing catandmouse game between bourne and his handlers i found the ending to be too abrupt tying everything up into a conveniently neat package and omitting a lot of vital details along the way but i guess thats what the sequels were for,intelligence
i love this movie it delivers everything that a spy chase thriller is supposed to deliver and does it with exceptional skill and economy of action also matt damon is fantastic in the title role of jason bournefirst a couple of caveats about who might not want to watch this film it contains some violent fight scenes that are fairly graphic and there are some shootings that are violent although not in the graphic pink mist gory way so you really dont want to sit down with the little kids and watch this one and adults who arent keen on violence in movies may want to give it a miss and theres some swearing both in english and in other languagesthe movie starts with jason bourne floating unconscious in the ocean where the crew of a fishing boat sees him and picks him up while one of the people on the boat administers first aid bourne violently regains consciousness and it becomes apparent that he has no idea who he is where he is how he got there he has been shot twice with superficial wounds more strangely still he had embedded in his hip a device that upon activation reveals a number that is apparently a bank account or code of some kind for a bank in zurichthe fishermen let bourne off when they reach their port in marseilles and with the money they give him for the work he did while on their boat he makes his way to zurich and the bankonce there he finds that he apparently has access to a safedeposit box that is filled with currency a variety of passports in different names but with his picture and a gun and now the chase is onbournes accessing the safe deposit box triggers the start of a cia hunt for him its apparent that hes some kind of black ops assassin for the cia but he himself doesnt yet know that or really understand who he is and what hes been doingthe rest of the movie consists of bourne who joins up with a somewhat flaky young woman who we know only as marie played superbly by franka potente who he meets in the american embassy where she is trying unsuccessfully to get a visais a very straightforward chase movie with bourne running away from people bent on killing him while trying to find out who he really iswhat raises it well above the average for this genre are two things first the way matt damon becomes jason bourne and makes him a thoroughly believable character who is likable in spite of having apparently been a bona fide assassin second the quality of the writing the stuntsaction and the general high level of the acting throughouti dont want to give too much of this movie away but i do have to mention the car chase scene in this movie the car chase has become such a staple of the action chase movie genre that its very very hard for anyone making this kind of movie to do something that doesnt seem mundane the car chase scene in is exceptional in the way it is choreographed the way it is photographed and the unique twists it has one of the better car chases of recent years although when the movie is over and you start thinking about it you have to wonder if maries decrepit little car really would have held together through what bourne put it through in the chase this is a superb action spy movie with matt damon truly exceptional as bourne youre on the edge of your seat rooting for him to evade the people who want to kill him and to find out who he is a very enjoyable actionspy movie one of the best of recent years,intelligence
2002 is a fastpaced action packed mystery film based on a man trying to find his true identity after an italian fishing boat crew found his body floating at sea after being shot and barely clinging to life once the man awakens and recovers from the near death experience he seems to have forgotten everything about himself including his name one clue the number to a swiss bank account while visiting the bank he finds numerous passports all belonging to him under different identities the identity he assumes is that of jason bourne after finding his identity jason bourne damon and leaving the bank bourne asks a women for a ride refusing his request she is forced to reconsider once bourne offers a large payment in cash finally convincing marie potente to drive him the two travel together in search of all the clues to his past but not without multiple problems and attempts from assassins to end their liveslighting throughout the film has a dark effect to it even throughout the daytime scenes based in the winter the snow slightly brightens the scenes throughout the daytime shots but the lighting is never bright until the ending scene when marie and bourne reunite in greece the darkness of the movies follows the darkness of jason bourne from not knowing his identity to learning of his occupation darkness follows bourne the cinematic point of view throughout most of the film that the director chose to use is indirectsubjective we are close to the action enough to get an emotional effect from the scenes in the scene where bourne and marie reunite the director uses a subjective point of view switching between the eyes of jason bourne and marie as the looks at one anotherwhile is based mostly on action drama and mystery the writers added in some romance between jason bourne and marie reluctant in the beginning to give bourne a ride to his destination she travels with him and the two share a moment in a love scene again the film turns to a bit of romance when bourne arrives at maries scooter shop in greece,intelligence
the 2002 film directed by doug liman is a highly action packed movie about crime and mystery the film stars matt damon and franka potente jason bourne matt damon is rescued by a fishing boat from the sea with bullet wounds in his back a chip implanted in his hip and no memory of who he is as he is recovering from his injuries on the ship he attempts to recover his memory of who he is as desperate as bourne is to find the answers to who he is he will discover that he may wish he did not know this chip implanted in his hip only has information of a bank account number once bourne find this lock box that this number belongs to he discovers many passports with different identities thousands of dollars and a gun it is also at the bank that bourne realizes that he is being haunted and his life is in danger bourne is surprised to have advanced combat skills bourne realizes that he needs to run and here is when he turns to marie franka potente for help he offers her money to drive him to paris where he believes that he lives marie assist him in trying to find out how he is and who is trying to kill him and why it is while they are in paris that he finds out that he is a spy and assign once bourne learns this about himself he wishes that he did not know who he was and wants to forget all of it however his life is still in danger and he has to fight to stay alive this film is similar to a 1996 film the long kiss goodnight where a female is suffering from amnesia and as she uncovers the secrets to her past she realizes that she was once a lethal topsecret agent there are many filming techniques used in this film quick cutting editing is used throughout the film as the scenes change but it does not have a choppy effect of the film because of all of the action in the film the changing of scenes are hardly noticeable the scenes change from fighting scenes to scenes of the cia on the hunt for bourne flawlessly the sound used in the film also keeps the audience awake and alert the sounds of gunfire and explosions keep the film entertaining and make the audience feel as though the scenes are real because of the realistic effects of the sounds although bourne was not happy with who he discovered he once was he is able to overcome his past and escape from the horror that was once his life,intelligence
a well played story action adventure a bit of plot and not completely predictable rats gotta make 10 lines feel free to skip to the more comprehensive reviews a little james bondish which was nice fast flowing action no time for the main character to rest car scenes some nice hand to hand combat a beautiful lady who becomes a part of the action and makes our man use his brain a little more the movie visits some beautiful regions of the world excites us with languages and dialects the spy who has it all fast flowing fun exciting not too black makes me want to read the book and while the whole blame the united states secret service kinda stuff is an easy target it kinda takes you to a more personal level than that,intelligence
this is one of those action movies that will inspire other action movies in the future or at least the style of it all i remember watching the trailer to this movie when it first came out which led me to watch this in theater the day it came out and although when i first saw it in theater back in 2002 and didnt completely understand what was going on at that time during the first viewing of it what i did know was that i actually enjoyed this action movie and was very entertained by it this is a spythriller that is done right and is a fast paced and stylish action that hardly has a dull moment and is crafted very well for the most part what i liked after viewing it again now is how its somewhat simple and yet intelligent at the same time when it comes to the direction of the plot now i know this movie is based on the novel by robert ludlum and although i havent read any of the bourn novels i am pretty sure the author would have been proud and also relieved besides the fast paced simple and yet intelligent direction what really stood out to me was the fast stylized and yet realistic action sequences yeah the whole thing with the amnesia seems a bit generic and far fetched in this but that is a very small flaw even the chase scenes are done really well so overall this is a solid movie that is worth watching and the other two sequels to come and maybe even the sequels after that as well in another words the future of spythrilleraction movies is bourne8510,intelligence
im going to keep this short first off matt damon fits into bourne like a glove the partnership between him and franka potente is excellent in fact the casting is spot on there are many brilliant set pieces such as the car chase and bournes escape from the embassythe story is great and thankfully ends in enthralling fashion the film speeds by like a bullet train one may complain about the action scenes and the constant shaking of the camera but some wont mind or even notice ityeah good film overall and with two more to be seen this film wont fail to hook you into the future of bourne,intelligence
ive watched this movie about 100 times and finally i see what is an obvious mistake the scene at the american embassey where he steps outside on the platform to hideget away there is almost no snowice on the platform but when the marines open the door seconds later the platform has 4 of virgin snow covering itcome on other than that well maybe there are not any more i guess ive watched the film to the point that i am getting picky i have also the up the two dogs quote on the sign and still do not know if that was a restaurant that i ate at in munich i think i know the crew traveled all over the world and some of the scenes are taken in one city but used in another but thats the movies right,intelligence

one trilogy i had been dying to see is the bourne trilogy so many people just love these movies and ive heard nothing but positive reviews about them most people i talk too told me that its a new james bond movie so i borrowed the movies from my boyfriend and watched them this week starting off with and what a way to start while i didnt find the film as exciting as i would expect it it is a very well done action movie the choreography was awesome and matt damon makes for a very strong male lead his character is the only thing that kept me going through the movie we start off not knowing who he really is and want to find out with him what happened to him who he is and why hes wanted dead or alive though preferably dead as he goes through heck to find out what is going on and only having one person on his side a woman who is probably only with him just because hes hot he finds out that hes almost like the superman assassin james bond would probably say well at least i still have my sexy weapons and lines of hot women waiting to jump my bonesa fishing boat crew finds an unconscious man adrift in the mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back when he wakes up the man comes to realize he suffers from amnesia having only one clue to his identity the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector traveling to switzerland to find the corresponding bank the man discovers he is skilled in advanced handtohand combat when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen he arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash and several passports with his photo but with numerous aliases he assumes the name jason bourne a few blocks away he induces marie with 20000 to take him to paris to the address on his bourne passport meanwhile back at cia headquarters the head of treadstone reveals to his supervisor that bourne was the covert operative responsible for a failed assassination attempt intending to sever all connections between the cia and wombosi conklin sends three highlytrained assassins to kill bourne the only thing these movies fall victim too is the shaky cam effect i understand its meant to make the audience feel tense but its not needed for 90 of the movie also i wished they had picked a different actress to play marie nothing wrong with franka potente shes a fine actress but she just didnt really capture me as marie and made her character into such a clich plus their love story isnt really that necessary and very random however like i said this is a very interesting story and im glad that i decided to check these movies out i really loved the car chase scene its rare we get a good one any more and it was handled so gracefully that made it so exciting im so curious if matt damon did his own stunts which is probably unlikely however those fight scenes were just awesome and again done with such style that it made the film worth watching the supporting cast holds up very well with chris cooper and julia styles im sad that chris cooper didnt make it for the other movies because his character is so dark and a great villain but the show must go on and other great villains will be introduced as we find out more about jason bourne710,intelligence
a floating body is found at sea off the coast of france with two bullets stuck in his back by freak chance it turns out that this is not a corpse but a severely wounded man who can not seem to remember anything from his past armed with only a swiss bank account the delinquent goes out to reclaim his identity  that of the highly skilled assassin jason bourne it was this welcome return of ludlums jason bourne that had most to do with a resurgence of spy movies but it also served as a guidebook for future and much superior movies in the genre such as the international or casino royale with the unlikely hero carrying the face of matt damon it was a break out hit which i decided to recollect in full during the festive seasonas such is a relatively crisp and refreshing action movie which hardly ever gets a tune wrong the thriller ride is gripping and to the most part attempts to be as realistic as possible in the slightly overthetop secret agent world he inhabits despite most fights or chase sequences being extremely flashy spectacular and even innovative at least eight years ago most of them seem to be as solidly stuck in real physics and physiology as possible  with a couple of relatively irrelevant exceptions also the scripting was extremely tight for a spy movie and hardly misses a beat with suggesting possible scenarios for our heroone or two action sequences stand out in the movie even if not necessarily the ones with are the most spectacular nothing as memorable as the shootout in the international but the relatively straightforward showdown between jason bourne and clive owens character the professor is especially noteworthyon the minus side the stereotypical african overlord is a real downer and the movie really gets a slight overdose of stereotyping which take away from the general pleasure of watching the movienonetheless by far the best of the bourne trilogy and despite the jumps in standards it has aged very well,intelligence
left for dead an american intelligence agent matt damon wakes with no memory and attempts to piece together who he really isis a solid proficient actionthriller that rarely seems to strain for effect the second hour  which has the hero chasing a paper trail across europe while the cia tries to tie up its loose ends  isnt nearly as much fun as the first but theres an unexpectedly classy cast for this kind of thing particular acclaim was directed toward the films central car chase which was described as an exciting action highlight and one of the best realized in the genre the film is the first in a trilogy being followed by the bourne supremacy 2004 and the bourne ultimatum 2007,intelligence
if you were fished out of the water with bullets in your back and a swiss bank account number in you hip and no memory of anything about your life what would you think and do as a drama this is quite good the audience is along for the ride as our main character is trying to find out who he is and we are trying to decide whether we are supposed to like him or hate him as a matter of fact this story has the audience guessing about all of the characters the catand mouse game is the real tension creatorthe action was kept more personal and i was very impressed to learn that matt damon had no prior martial arts training unfortunately for me most of the action scenes were so predictable that they were boringthis is a prerequisite for the borne supremacy the best of the trilogy oh and julia stiles is not the girlfriend,intelligence
happens to be my favourite spy novel robert ludlum takes us on an exhilarating ride through a plot full of unexpected twists i chose not to watch this movie when it was released primarily because i hadnt read all the bourne novels i finally saw this movie six years after it was released and i was surprised and shocked and not pleasantly may i addthough its understandable that the entire novel cant be brought to life onscreen comparisons to the novel are inevitable the movie adaptation took away an entire character one whose importance in the plot was next only to bourne and this deprived the movie of some of the best sequences most importantly the titanic climax of the noveli found the movie to be very ordinary though the action scenes have been very well done the suspense just wasnt there clive owen has been wasted in a forgettable role cant say that matt damons portrayal of jason bourne was what i had imagined but he does an earnest job neverthelessoverall i dont see the fans of the novel liking this movie,intelligence

1st watched 12182008 dirdoug liman excellent action movie about a man named jason bourneor at least thats one of his names who is found at the beginning of the movie floating in the ocean who is alive but has been shot he doesnt remember who he is why he got shot or anything else about his past he finds a chip embedded inside him with a swiss bank account number on it and he ventures to try and find out who he is he also has the unique ability to defend himself and is almost computerlike with his self defense mechanisms and he doesnt know why this is either we find out later that he is being tracked by the cia and they are trying to get rid of him this is the basic storyline of the movie but despite the simplicity of the plot matt damon is excellent in the role and is very believable in this character his cohort and female love interest played by franka polentea german actress is also very appealing as the drifter who attaches to the wandering antihero carrying some of her own baggage as well there is a bevy of other capable actors and actresses who costar and also help the movie i wont give away any more of the plot for those who want to watch the movie but thats really about it have fun watching it like i did and enjoy this simple but well played story watching this definitely makes me look forward to the next installment,intelligence
the new millennium has found its new action hero and its not xxx or pierce brosnans james bond  its jason bourne based on the popular robert ludlum novel finally makes the solo action protagonist work in the era of amped up stunts and special effects bourne is slick skilled way smart and attractive and best of all he doesnt even know who he is while more fastpaced and driven by mystery than most action heroes certainly not as leisurely as james bond bourne finally delivers the nononsense hero we all rightfully deservewe are introduced immediately to jason bourne damon as he is pulled out of the mediterranean sea with two bullets in his back when he wakes he has suffered a complete memory loss interestingly enough however he finds he has a pretty incredible skill set that includes some sort of mixed martial arts and heightened environmental awareness slowly he pieces his life together only to find hes wanted dead for some reason by the cia who presumably he used to work for while on the run he picks up marie german actress franke potente blow who decides to join the goose chase rather than ditch him and take his cashthe film carries a pretty allstar cast including chris cooper and brian cox as cia higher ups and julia stiles and clive owen in smaller roles they help sort of spread out your interest in the mystery elements of the film mainly the very large and looming enigma that is jason bourne as it is part of a greater series identity doesnt exactly answer all your questions but it clearly establishes who bourne is and why the audience should care about himthe concept of bourne not knowing who he is at the film is a very obvious entry point for the audiencewe are meant to learn about bourne as he uncovers the truth himself and identify with him and his actionschoices as a result he may be much more of a super spy in terms of the sweet moves he pulls on his enemies and not how many gadgets he uses none his drive to understand why he is that way keeps it real for usmatt damon is a great fit for bourne he pulls of the sort of robotic lay down the law quality that is bournes action hero side but he does get across the internal struggle to understand himself that makes him human potente as the leading lady is an odd choice the casting directors were certainly not going for a knockout in the looks department or acting for that matter but her very generic looks sort of help ground the film in reality in a way not every action hero is meant to hook up with a supermodel equivalentmost importantly the action is really well paced and exciting impressive for director doug limans first action film the fights are incredibly wellchoreographed and the editing is nothing short of fantastic while the script tries to awkwardly heighten the drama at times youre really too caught up in the story and the action sequences to care too much about what bourne and marie are saying to each other this is a spy thriller first ask deeper questions later movie and best of all you never shake your head at it welcome to the new age of action heroes,intelligence
the bourne franchise is one that has for no particular reason passed me by until now and it was only because i noticed the dvd on sale for a stupidly cheap price and been assured by friends that all three films were worth watching that ive now seen the first film assuming the law of diminishing returns applies to this franchise i dont think ill be seeking out the other two bourne flicks in a hurry thats not to say this film is bad  its not its a wellmade action film slick and glossy with some nice european locations  but there is just nothing particularly special about it and the last ten minutes completely ruin what has gone beforematt damon plays the central character a government assassin who is pulled out of the sea by a fishing boat with no recollection of who he is and a collection of bullets nestling just under his skin the rest of the film concerns damons efforts to discover just who  and what  he is aided by a german gypsy in the shapely form of franka potente while he simultaneously tries to evade the cia contract killers out to eliminate what they now consider to be a rogue agent potente with her deglamourised look is as well cast as damon is not hes too preppy looking to convince as a coldblooded killer  even one working for the land of the free he looks like hed run a mile if the saloon drunk decided he didnt like the look of his stubblefree face perhaps director liman understood this because the fight sequences are edited at such a lightning pace that were not really given much time to see what is going on sometimes the camera seems so close you half expect a flailing fist to catch the cinematographer a glancing blowanyway bournes quest follows a fairly eventful and predictable path one that is strewn with a number of fist fights a wellfilmed car chase a little rumpy with his new travelling companion and one welcome moment of dry humour when potente overrides damons convoluted plan to obtain vital information from a hotel through covert means by simply asking the hotel concierge to tell her what they need to know although bourne remembers nothing of his past he has retained the killer instinct as well as the smarts to gradually pull most of the strands together which results in the inevitable showdown with his former boss  a role effortlessly nailed by the woefully underused chris cooper an actor who is the epitome of classthose last ten minutes though first were expected to believe this highlytrained coldhearted killer is unable to eliminate his target because of the cute buttonnosed kid sleeping in the marks lap as if his employers wouldnt have tested him in this kind of situation it really is a terrible moment that left me gawping if he suddenly had an attack of conscience could we please have some kind of clue as to why maybe the cia boobed  perhaps bourne ticked the box marked i do not wish to assassinate cute innocent children on covert assignments of national importance anyway bourne hesitates raises his gun and  bam  their go two stars from the movies rating i almost dropped another star for that stupid falling through the air on the back of a dead fat man stunt but the film had already been spoiled for me by then so it didnt really matter,intelligence
typically im not much of a fan of the thriller genre but having just seen the bourne trilogy im fairly impressed with what ive seen this first installment directed by doug liman introduces the character of amnesiac jason bourne matt damon and sets him on his perilous quest to discover his true identitythe cast is a good one with matt damon doing well in a much more actionoriented role than any he had previously undertaken on bournes tail are chris cooper  brian cox both dependable actors franka potente as bournes romantic interest isnt bad but i could have done without the romantic element altogetherthe story is a pretty compelling one once you get past the hackneyed case of amnesia particularly interesting is how the story here turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg as seen in the two sequels i will admit that i wasnt exactly thrilled with the ending here thoughthe direction by liman is workmanlike and is more concerned with constantly propelling the action rather than creating visuals that are interesting in and of themselves the music fits well into the scheme of things contributing to the mood but rarely calling attention to itselfthis is a good thriller sure to meet the approval of those who enjoy such films i think that the two sequels were marginally better but this film is definitely an above average beginning to the series,intelligence
i saw this movie when it came out and found it an average but enjoyable action movie nothing special i didnt understand where some peoples enthusiasm came from but later i was recommended to read robert ludlums book so i did years after seeing the movie with matt damon and man i liked it the story was complex and exciting with all these twists and turns i couldnt stop reading and the whole time i thought didnt i pay attention when watching the movie how could i have thought this wasnt anything special when i finished the book i purchased the dvd and watched it immediately when i came homeok first of all no bad comment on matt damon he is the jason bourne i had in mind the whole time when reading the book and he does a great job the action scenes are nice too nothing wrong there but what happened to the story where is all the stuff that i liked so much about the book they just shrunk the story to man wakes up without his memory finds out hes a professional killer and his former employer wants him dead is that all what the hell happened to charly delta cain wheres carlos what about jasons past and the real reason he took did the writers think the people who would go see it might probably be too stupid to understand the story in its full complexity the way it was meant to be really everything that made the original story so incredibly interesting was left away even if it would take 3 hours or more to tell the story of jason bourne i would stay in my chair and watch it to the finishbefore i read the book i found an average action movie after i read the book i now find the movie an insult on late robert ludlums work thank god theres more where that came from so far the bourne supremacy is just as exciting as identity,intelligence
a man is dragged on board a fishing boat unconscious shot and in pretty bad shape however through luck or god he winds up in a french hospital with no recollection of who he is however what he does know is that his name appears to be jason bourne however the more he starts digging the more names he finds the more under threat he is the more he is able to lash out at a moments notice blocking his opponents with the perfect amount of force this is a man who is literally a walking weapon eventually he stumbles upon the beautiful marie who decides to help him feeling that maybe their is something more to bourne than meets the eyethe film is very very loosely based on the immense thriller by robert ludlum and when i have been going through the reviews one thing stands out and that is a large amount of people who rate the book do not rate the film and there are good reasons for this for it isnt just about things that dont transfer well there is great stuff in key issues that relate directly to the title that are just ignored that make the rest of the film utterly pointless the identity that he thinks he has is not necessarily what it actually is in the book this is dealt with in a fantastic way that if done correctly on film would have had the audience on the edge of their seat not touched on herehowever the other big problem with the film and one that i cant quite believe that no0ne else has a problem with is that the climactic end when we supposedly find out what has happened and who bourne is transpires that the despot that bourne was sent to kill he didnt because their was a kid there so this person we were routing for pussied out and were supposed yo like him i didnt this could be a robert mugabe type or a pol pot type of despot who would no doubt be grooming his children for future atrocities how many other children were going to be killed because he had not carried out the assignment this was not some shadow identity that was fiction this was supposedly the person that we were routing for or to put it differently if the only chance you had to go back in time and kill hitler was whilst he was playing with some children at his lair in the mountains would you do it i think most of us know what the answer would bethe film itself is at its best when it is using or reflecting aspects of the book which it does a lot of in the first half and at its worse when it ignores them as in the second half of the film the car chase which others have wrote is great is not the special and does not match the sequences in the superb taxi series of films or even the more recent vantage point the main issue that people have with this film and i suspect the main reason why it scores so highly is that it seems edgy compared to a bond who is usually super cool but simply the virtue of being different does not necessarily a good film makefor those who read and not just on a computer get the book it makes the film seem about as edgy as a rotting cucumber nuff said,intelligence
my take slick and stylish adaptation of the classic ludlum bestsellerrobert ludlums adapted here in this 2002 big screen romp is an oldfashioned thriller but a heck of a good one its an oldfashioned espionage chase thriller owing a lot to matt damons excellent performance in the title role and the superior direction and pacing like all good mystery thrillers this one keeps us gripped guessing and interested from the first frame to the last i was hookedthe film centers on jason bourne a man who finds himself in the middle of the ocean with two bullets lodged into his back he doesnt know who he is and what happened to him after being rescued by a fishing boat he is dropped to france where he tries to find out who he is he finds out hes a government assassin a professional at the job who the government no longer trusts now hes a target of the government he used to work for to escape he aids help of marie franka potente who also becomes a target of the same agencythere are a number of great chase scenes that follow theres the paris chase scene where a mini copper is chased by the police the film is mostly in lowkey but it keeps the energy level really high theres action here and there but some really good thrills as well and a tight plot that keeps us interested and hooked the performances are great as is the script overall a terrific thrillerrating 12 out of 5,intelligence
i was expecting an actionpacked adrenalin fuelled  exciting action film i spent 24 on the bourne trilogy 24 quid i regret it to the back bone now is torture boredom most of the way some decent parts that made me shiver but that was it the rest was just boringthe start was very promising i was thinking that this was going to be decent but it wasnt its a cheap excuse for an action film and is trying to copy the legendary james bond copying him badlyi wouldnt recommend this to anyone not even people i dislike im not that crueli just pray that the bourne supremacy is any better to save the trilogy ill be watching and reviewing it tomorrow510,intelligence
this movie i had to say was very disappointing i saw it expecting more did i get it no i did noti thought it was going to be a good action flick with a good storythe action was so frantic and the fight scenes were zoomed in and you could not see what was happening they might have just threw black paint at the wall and we wouldnt know the differencealso the ending was horrid it ended like every other bad action flickso if you think this is a good movie then go watch more movies other than ones like thisto be plain and simple if you havent seen this movie and you want to please dont it is a major disappointment,intelligence
this film packs more car chases into one story than any other i know but even the most intense and thrilling urban chases get dull and blurry after the third time or so story is ok but clich evil government against one man ok ok matt damon delivers a decent performance as a vacanteyed trained killer but his stunt men should receive most of the credit in this film one of the most redeeming choices in the script is not to indulge too much in the love element there is just the minimum to fill the hollywood but not an ounce more which is perfect for this kind of film julia stiles plays an executive so she looks old in film even though she was under 29 but she manages to look hotter than franka potente who does almost nothing but stare and scamper around,intelligence
of course movies about spies being hunted down are not all that uncommon but and its two sequels are some of the best ones that have appeared on the screen in years identity is the first and in my opinion the secondbest out of them all it has the most originality to it makes the character of jason bourne seem the most clever and even the more vulnerable than he does in the two following films and is overall a nifty action moviematt damon was the perfect choice for playing jason bourne a former assassin from a series of novels that failed in a mission was injured presumed dead and later turned out alive only with amnesia he soon finds out heres a target for assassination and must try and find the people he originally worked for find out who he is and why they are trying to kill him now damon is a very versatile actor and is very efficient at the rolefranka potentes character while not a major development or powerful character was a necessary character to keep the story rolling the fact is the movie would have been more boring and less compelling if boune was completely by himself at first potentes character is developed enough just to make the point of her being there not so that the audience will become attached to her and i think that was the general idea when they were piecing together the screenplayaction sequences in were very clever and ingenious like the following two films bourne is realized as being like rambo he is able to use a variety of tools for his own defense he can use a gun as well as his own fists and if he needs a weapon as he demonstrates in one scene he can grab a pen and use it as effectively as if it were a knife of course some of his kills were a bit unbelievable and humanly impossible but then again its an action movie lots of them are like that and the audience is just to sit back and enjoy it and the cool thing is that bourne is like rambo not just a random crazy killer as we can assume he was before he got amnesia he tries to spare his attackers whenever he can and only kills when it becomes clear to him and the audience that there is obviously no choice left to himbut what i like most of all about as well as the bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatum is that it ends with several points unclear making it obvious to the audience that there will be more to come in each film many questions are asked some are answered most are left unsolved and in each entry more are asked more are answered and even more are left its a representation of how jason bourne is thinking as hes put into these situations and the audience effectively follows him,intelligence
in the days before tom clancy robert ludlum wrote the most popular if fantastical even slightly ridiculous spy novels but of course times change and there is no way that a movie can come close to covering the complexities of a good spy novel had to be updated because there is no more carlos the jackal in fact there never really was he was somewhat bad at his job the press actually created a mountain out of a dung heap having read the bourne idnetity back in the day i had trouble equating mat dillon with the title character but realizing they would make the movie according to todays realities i tried to go in with an open mind however the movie was just too ridiculous warning a summary and two spoilersthe movies premise stays true to the book in that an assassin named jason bourne is rescued by a fishing boat in the mediterranaean halfdead bourne has two bullets in him and is soon in shape a few days with scant medical supplies in the movie versus the book in which a drunk exbritish doctor sews him up and gives some good advice while rehabilitating him next we see bourne though he doesnt know hes bourne because he has amnesia going to the swiss city of zurich because he has a small laser pointer containing the banks address and an account number surgically implanted in his hipfrom there it is a whirl wind adventure through europe as bourne struggles to recall anything from his memory regarding his identity all this man seems to be cut out for is killing along the way he picks up a wandering german chick who happens to agree to drive a mad man to paristhen he kills a lot of guyspeople have tagged this movie relaisitc that is both absurd and frightening bourne here is so bullet proof he seems like a kung fu movie hero from saturday afternoons or a james bond from the seventies although damon does not seem to have the mileage to pull off the character it is bournes inability to do any wrong that is too much to swallow for example in an oldlone french house in a tiny valley surrounded by forested hills the childrens dog does not answer a morning call so bourne realizing he is being hunted not so unrealistic finds a shotgun does not look outside and study the surroundings then walks out and shots a heating oil tank and uses the ensuing smoke screen to run into cover towards the waiting assassin excpet for the fact of course how could he know where the killer was another even more implausible scenario was when he was at the top of stairwell being fired at by man coming up the stairwell bourne used a corpse as cover as they plummet five or six stories between the stringers of steps not only does bourne shoot the assassin on the way down at what 64 feet per second but he lands on his stomach on the corpse as if that would break his fall safety tip when you try this at home you need to fall on your back otherwise the force of the blow travels to your spine and blows it to piecesthe gaps in reality are big enough to accommodate al gores carbon footprint if you want to see chris cooper and matt damon in a realistic movie watch syrianna or see munich that movie will show you how crazy the espionage game is may be fun but its mental junkfood,intelligence
im not particularly a fan of the whole actionmovie genre but i have to say that in you have to love the action it really does make the movie the fight scenes are incredible and the chase scene as bourne matt damon leads the paris police on a car chase through the city is amazing the action alone makes this worth watchingthe story on the other hand is somewhat intriguing as we untangle some of the mystery revolving around bournes identity but the basic premise which isnt hidden at all in the movie has a ring of familiarity to it bourne is some sort of supercia operative whos lost his memory and has no idea of who he was or what he did for a living but he sure does have some amazing abilities that he hasnt forgotten as were told during the movie hes a 30 million weapon thats malfunctioning that didnt strike me as particularly original although it was unclear to me at least whether his abilities came from genetic engineering some type of implant or just incredible trainingdamons performance was quite good and i thought franka potente came across well as marie the woman who helps bourne and begins to fall for him at the same time even while becoming increasingly uncomfortable as more is revealed about his past its enjoyable and exciting even if it has a bit of a wellworn premise and it caught my interest enough to make me want to see the sequels 710,intelligence
 i had with this movie now i wont get into any kind of spy discussion in the sense that this is how bond should be like or how 21st century spy movies should be made because seriously if every other movie would be alike that wouldnt be coolgood now would it diversity is a good thing now this movie can hold up to any espionagespy thriller that is out there matt damon does fit the bill here and it all especially the storymoves along quite good that is until the end  this was so incoherent with the rest which was innovative in contrast to this clich ridden section that it felt to me like a cheat of course they had to come up with something but im sure there were better ways to exit the movie  thats why my rating for the movie failed to be higher,intelligence
this is fine quite a surprise in fact and ive been putting off watching for fear of disappointment being a fan of the earlier thrillers without an overload of gadgets and cgi and especially the gritty 60s70s italian movies ive tended to avoid the blockbuster fare but this is good there are plot holes and a little silliness but who cares when the action whips you along maybe this or that is not quite right but do we have time to sit and ponder do we heck no irrelevant love scenes no long sequences to try and explain how this really is realistic we dont care if we get a car chase through the streets of paris with enough decent dialogue for us to become involved well never complain i think that possibly shooting so much in paris also has altered the way the film feels and maybe forced the directors hand a little thereby making this look and feel a little more european never a bad thing now for the other two,intelligence
rewatched on tv last week and dint realise i hadnt reviewed before so here it is have you ever woken up on a strange boat with bullet holes in you and not knowing where you are or who you are then youll love is built around jason bourne matt damon who wakes up on a table on a boat in the middle of the ocean he has no idea where he is who he is and how he got on the boat upon arriving on land he begins to try to discover who he is it soon becomes clear hes some sort of assassin he sets out to discover who he works for and what lies ahead with the help of a strange girl he digs up his past and finds out pieces of the puzzle that is himreally good movie shot in some great locations with some excellent fight sequences the greatest appeal of the movie though is the lack of dialogue bourne is cold and calculated and overdone verbal communication would be out of place top stuff,intelligence
i was slow in coming around to the bourne movies and now im squeezing in identity and supremacy so that i can see the bourne ultimatum which is getting ravesis about what i expected its a slick action thriller that will satisfy the craving for dumb stunts car chases and fistfights but which also has a brain in its head youll have to suspend a whole bunch of disbelief and there were a couple of instances that went so far as to make that quite a challenge indeed like many films of its ilk this one doesnt know what in the world to do with female characters so our main one screams and acts helpless while the only other one played by julia stiles plays really no part at all in the proceedings i only suspect that her importance increases later as i see that stiles is in the later movies as well the men meanwhile do what men in these movies do which is survive blows and falls that no mortal could actually survive and bark out macho orders while strutting around with their hands on their hipsi recently took a trip to paris and barcelona so i very much enjoyed the location filming in paris and got quite excited when even some shots of barcelona made it into the film during one montagegrade b,intelligence
it is first of all an action film in which the whole action goes wrong because the agent did not do what he was supposed to do he did not kill his target and he got shot at and he lost his memory the story is unluckily not entirely clear he forgot his identity fine he did not forget his physical training fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts but how did he remember he had a bank account in zurich and the number of the bank account and whats more why did not the cia close the account since the operation had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead this leads to more questions but that is not really important for the action though we like it absolutely clean the message however is not altered at all the cia is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through these killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars the objective is simple control the world with puppets who can be anything democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats no matter which or their reverses provided they serve well otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture when this film came out the us were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism the picture of this cia is pretty terroristic to me we know now several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information though it did gather some but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say is that very democratic at the end of the film when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the senate we are just relieved because the killing robot agent jason bourne has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into but the story cannot be finished because the cia cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart for one simple reason they do not have a heart in other words the cold war is maybe finished but the terroristic spying agencies politically correctly named intelligence agencies are still thriving and well we have not yet reached the country of perfect transparency and total democracy and we pretend to give lessons to the barbarians who are not part of our club dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne,intelligence
yes im not surprised when p jackson cuts many parts in the lord of the rings to make his movies this is logical but here why change so many things  the beginning the story the presence of carlos the terrorist in the books  why not in the movie  no additional special effects were required to make the perfect adaptation so but its still a nice movie matt damon just plays bourne nice even if i think hes a bit young for the character of jason bourne action suspense well everything is here goes fast no dead time this is good finally im gonna watch the supremacys right now i heard it was even better ill see,intelligence
based very loosely on robert ludlums novel is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fisherman who nurse him back to health he can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as the swiss bank account the number of which is implanted in his hip he soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with marie on a search to find out who he is and why he is being huntedi liked the concept of the film a lot i liked the whole thing about the movie but its sometimes very confusing in my simpleheaded mind well its certainly a really good spy film i can tell you that there were some great action scenes and some suspenseful ones toothe acting by matt damon and franka potente were good and there really isnt anything else to say about this film since im not thinking well this is a great spy movie go see it,intelligence
the bourne idenity was a very good and new kind of action movie it is a very good mystery that was based on a good book this movie is full of very well shot action scenes and is full of twists all the way to the end matt damon does a great performance as a spysecret agent this movie is a different take on espionage action movies this movie does not deserve the negative reviews that it got people say that it is too confusing yeah newsflash its called mystery oooh emphasize people may not like this movie but i do this was a good movie i like it i dont know what else there is to say people should see this movie 810,intelligence
on the male scale this movie rates very high there is plenty of action violence killing and a girl although there was no token nudity this was just the kind of movie i could sink my teeth into but i found the taste of it off just a bit as amazing as jason bourne matt damon was i simply wasnt behind his character 100 it is one thing for a random individual to pull off one miraculous escape plan after another and artistically kill one bad guy after another but it is entirely different when a character that you love or genuinely sympathize with is performing the same feats i think that bourne was just a little to mechanical and lacked charisma or a distinguishing personality which added up to indifference on my part towards his plight now it may be said thats what makes him an excellent assassin and i would agree but in this particular case where he was the hunted not the hunter i was expecting a bit more as far as emotions or even fallibility of course the more interesting part of the movie is when we find out why bourne is on the run and why he didnt kill his target before he lost his memory in fact he was a hitman with a heart even though we see none of that until late still it was a good movie i just didnt enjoy it as much as id hoped,intelligence
i have a whole stack of 2006 films to watch but this came on again and i could not resist revisiting it even though i know what is going to happen i remember reading this series when the books came out and the movies remind me of that pleasure mat damon is just fantastic in the role of jason bourne franka potente is just so hot in a quiet way i cant wait for a new film with her to come out chris cooper breach capote silver city is also outstanding in this filmthe car chase through the streets of paris was fantastic only the transporter can out drive bourne the action is non stop and intense a super film,intelligence
this was a really good action thriller for me it was smart and entertaining the story of a government project gone wrong the plot follows jason bourne a american intelligence super agent that has been trained and designed to kill and easily cover up his tracks the only problem is that human fault came into play and he was unable to complete his mission because of his conscience matt damon does a really great job of bring this loner bad ass guy with a heart to life the action kept me on the edge of my seat and i enjoyed the little romance between bourne and the german girl i have not read the book but im guessing it is good because people always say in most cases the book is better than the movie i think this movie is definitely worth watching and it always seems to be on tv,intelligence
overall and excellent film bourne and the rest of the treadstone program are arguably the deadliest men alive those who survived at least smart and dangerous in my opinion this is what modern spy thrillers should look like how do men without an enemy act soldiers need an enemy and if there isnt one they create it tension moves along with the story but then something goes wrongon a more technical side the dialog could have been better but it is both the tacital narration and the acting what carries the plot of the movie of course the characters aint poets and philosophers they are cia agents trained assassins and a german bohemian lady then we have the great action and chase scenes plus one thing that never ceases to amaze me perhaps the only series of movies filmed almost entirely onlocation a remarkable featurei have the same opinion for supremacy and cant wait for ultimatum,intelligence
this series starring matt damon in the lead role number two to date directed by doug liman and later the bourne supremacy directed by paul greengrass the bourne ultimatum directed by greengrass will be released this summer 2007 the bourne novels were written originally by robert ludlum who although still living just after identity was released did not get to see it before his deathi dont know why universal studios decided to switch directorial horses in midstream identity proved that limon had the filmmaking expertise and delivered it in fine stylein many ways i think identity was somewhat better than supremacy the story just seemed to hang together a bit better the moscow car chase scene in supremacy topped the paris car chase scene in identity but i actually liked the kalimartialartlaced paris fight scene in the first film better than the munich fight in the secondgreengrass and crew were fine in supremacy so much so that i decided to rent bloody sunday an earlier film directed by greengrass bad mistake i like supremacy but bloody sunday was a very bad movie in my opinionhas its share of goofs and loopholes but not enough to derate it too badly after all these characterdriven spy thrillers are best viewed by just ignoring things like thatadd a fine score toprate supporting actors and superb cinematography to bring up to a level that is entertaining and fun to watch even over and over again nine out of ten,intelligence

about halfway through this movie i realized that it was much better than the average thriller there is a scene between matt damons character who has lost his memory and franka potentes character marie who picked him up based on an offer of 20000 when marie says hell probably go inside and then forget shes out there so she might as well just leave he replies how could i forget about you youre the only person i know this line shows the backbone of this thrillermatt damon does not know who he is where he came from or what hes supposed to be doing we dont know either the things he can do however beg the question of whether or not he is an average person like say speaking several different languages and knocking two cops out in 5 secondsthis could have just been an average thriller but this level of the unknown makes it all the more compelling we never quite know who anyone is not matt damon nor brian cox chris cooper franka potente clive owen or julia stiles but the relationships are drawn so well that we can guess and infer and thats all we need in this the redeeming value in this movie comes from the action sequences and the suspense matt damons stoic performance anchors everything into a cohesive and coherent picture that never fails to engrossi think this has been dismissed as just another thriller i also think its better than that go enjoy yourself and see it,intelligence
robert ludlums first bourne novel is translated into a postsoviet world to dazzling effect ludlum himself helped the translation to the screen just before he died and is on record as throughly approving the result and why on earth shouldnt he despite a clearly limited budget doug liman delivers an excellently paced  gripping espionage thriller which makes recent bond films look like the flacid tripe they have often beenmatt damon is truly a revelation and proves that an articulate intelligent actor can do an action movie with great conviction his screen relationship with his costar franke potente is a joy to watch and one of the strengths of the film,intelligence
who knew matt damon could be an action hero he does this quite well in bourne identity granted at times i was distracted by his boston accent but even spies can be from boston i guess jason bourne wakes up on a german ship to discover he does not know who he is or what he was doing the rest of the film is to determine his identity and this is the films strong point while action films are a dime a dozen action films with a good mystery are harder to come by and this one deliversfights romance but not too much like james bond and intrigue with a bit of good will hunting mixed in what jason bourne knows is simply amazing but believable in the context of this filmone fight scene was strange because it didnt really make a lot of sense i wont give away the details but youd think if youre assassinating someone youd want to be silent but this guy makes as much noise as humanly possible you know what i mean if youve seen itlastly i want to touch on the women of the film choosing the run lola run aka lola rennt star as damons costar was the perfect choice shes beautiful in an unconventional way and you know she can fight and run when she needs to though this is hardly shown in the film and giving her more american exposure certainly doesnt hurt julia stiles on the other hand was a disappointment i love her in almost everything she does but i couldnt take her seriously as a government agent her theater training made me think she was overdoing her part and she struck me as being too immature to handle clandestine actions maybe thats just me and maybe she gets better in supremacy but im happy her part was so smallverdict bourne identity shines,intelligence
i hadnt watched this movie in a while so i decided to pop it in a give it a watch boy was i pleasantly surprised i didi didnt recall much of the movie only that i enjoyed it enough to buy the dvd the movie has a great raw feel to it really adding the perfect element to this whole who am i feel throughout the movie matt damon plays his role as the amnesia filled jason bourne very well in my opinion hes wound up tightly enough that every little comment about his past gets to him and he then goes and takes out his anger out on everything the cia throws at him all the elements add together to make a great movie the camera work the scenes the colors and especially the soundtrackit was all definitely thought out perfectlyon the whole id give this film somewhere near a 82510but for round numbers sake ill drop it down to 8 for this enjoyable action film i hope the bourne ultimatum is just as good,intelligence
a man with gunshot wounds in picked up by fishermen off of the coast of france and he has no memory of how he got there picking up clues one by one he gradually begins to see that is an elite espionage agent who is now being hunted by assassinsrobert ludlums immensely complex and engrossing story had virtually little to no chance in making it to the movie screen without the sacrificing of many details and subplots and doug liman here does just that and presents heavily altered story but it is actually pretty darn good this is not a typical hollywood action movie and there is a strong focus on what ludlum was so good at presenting in his books the element of realism like the great action film ronin this movie is both exciting and intelligent it goes overthetop as most stories do but it does it in a way that is very refreshing from even good mainstream hollywood action movies like the rock and everyones favorite action classic die hardmatt damon is almost flawless in the lead as jason bourne putting in a performance that seems simplistic only on the surface not quite as intense as ludlums original character but very good by movie standards 810rated pg13 for violence and occasional profanity,intelligence
im not a keen fan of spy movies in fact i have never seen one in my life but when i watched my style of movie completely changed in the space of less than 6 months i used to like action movies such as speed and saving private ryan which were arguably the best action films of the nineties but this is now the 20th century the time when films should have taken a few steps forward towards high entertainment thankfully shows the best example of a futuristic action spy thriller with matt damon playing jason bourne a 30 million dollar weapon as an assassin who suffers from amnesia gets shot and loses his memory the film takes us on a worldwide journey to find out exactly who he is being tracked down by surprising characters bourne finds clues as he makes the most of this rollercoaster ride using his energy to battle against his hunters in kungfu style fights exhilarating car chases and of course the weapon he uses not so often a brain i have in fact seen the bourne supremacy as well and thats even better but this is the start of many bourne movies to come in the next few decades this is the new bond era but with amnesia i dont think damon can even remember the bond movies superb,intelligence
the plot of this movie is intriguing it keeps you constantly thinking even at the end much remains mysterious about who did what why and even who many of the characters wereif the movie has a message it is about collateral damage cia types completely lose track of the fact they are destroying innocent peoples lives it becomes too much a game for themi found one fight scene in the movie extremely tedious after an intriguing start with verbal dueling to my surprise even fast forwarding it went on forever similarly for an interminable boring car chase through the streets of moscowthe movie would greatly benefit from pruning back or refilming the fights and chase sequences they are without imagination and go on far too longthe only fight scene that really worked was the first one in the movie over in a few seconds between bourne and the obnoxious young cia agent it took your breath away with its precision the rest of action was a letdown after that,intelligence

i read by robert ludlum before i saw the movie i loved the book great suspensefilled actionpacked story filled with plot twists then i saw the movieas action movies go it was great but as the movie came to a close i got more and more disappointed the movie does not follow the book and makes some pretty significant changes i dont know if the books plot twists were just too complicated for the movie or what but i wish the film makers had at least triedoverall though is a topnotch action flick my husband hadnt read the book and he loved it my recommendation would be to wait a while before watching the movie if youve already read the book or watch the movie before reading the book the book is so good anyway that reading it after the movie will probably just make its more intense plot that much more entertaining,intelligence
spy films are so clich since the cold war ended that i simply gave up because no one seemed to figure out how to make a spy film relevant to todayuntil i saw it just came out of nowhere and left me floored having never heard of the ludlum books i quickly read the first installment and had to sadly conclude that the movie was better than the book largely because the book was embarrassingly out of date in todays wifi blackberry world it is no wonder why ludlum wanted to do an update of the bookas far as the unreality of bourne snapping and not executing his mission thoughtful reflection reveals that it makes perfect sense bourne doesnt exist his mission was to kill wambosi and the only explanation was a member of the crew but wambosis child saw him which blew his cover killing the kid wasnt part of his mission leaving him no choice but to fleelots of people moan about the dissimilarities to the book richard chamberlain yada yada yada my guess is these people are not gen xyers because i certainly cant even remember having seen a movie with richard chamberlain let alone some madefortvjunk so if youre sacked out at the parentsgrandparents i guess youll have to pop the betamax of chamberlain in but as soon as they doze off pop this dvd in it rocks,intelligence
theres a nice idea at the heart of matt damons amnesiac discovers a clue as to his identity only to discover he has not one but many  hes apparently an undercover agent  so which one is the real him unfortunately the film is not very interested in the true psychology of amnesia bourne is far too composed to be convincing for someone who has forgotten everything and bizarrely he is able to judge what he learns about himself as aberrant and strange ie he remembers what he was not and is thus able to compare what he discovers about himself but has not remembered to this which makes little sense the film has some other annoying features the cia is represented as pure evil but also as nearomnipotent the film is full of exaggerated fight and chase scenes that are less gripping than more realistic ones would be for however actionpacked you cant help but feel you are watching a cartoon and julia stiles keeps popping up for no reason whatsoever as if the producers wanted her in the movie even though there is no role for her to play but on the plus side the production values are high a selection of european locations make effective backdrops the tension is maintained throughout and franka potente makes a sexy leading female and some sequences like the opening dissection of a wetsuit are immaculately assembled ultimately this is popcorn cinema shallow and lightweight but nicely done all the same,intelligence
matt damon stars in a good but predictable thriller as a cia operative who tries to piece together his past make sense of the present and decide what to do next damon falls out of favor with higherups at the agency for not taking out an african political figure and now they deem the agent as soft and expendable the film opens with damon being pulled out of the mediterranean by fishermen who nurse him back to health his travels take him to zurich where he finds money passports weapons and a german girl who becomes his reluctant partner as the local police close in on him the film is a travelogue as the pursuit and action scenes move through the swiss alps to paris where the cgi and stunts become the focal point of the film franka potente is the young woman who gets damon out of a tight spot and the two begin their dangerous journey together the stars have a few moments of quality alone time but spend most of the time trying to stay out of harms way,intelligence
tells the story of an american spy named jason bourne he is found floating in the ocean and is pulled aboard a fishing boat he cant remember his name his occupation where he lives anything however he possesses amazing fighting skills and he doesnt know how he goes on a journey to find out who he is and what he did for a living along the way he finds out that he was a lethal spy and now he is being huntedis an entertaining action film the chase scenes are awesome and the fight scenes are well choreographed and well filmed though the movie changes a lot from the book it still has the same feel to it and it flows just as well all of the actors in this movie did a good job in their roles especially matt damon who shows his diversity in this movieis a thrilling action movie with a great story the movie doesnt slow down i definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good action movie with a deep plot810,intelligence
i felt this movie was a bit of a letdown im glad it followed the book and i was hyped up when it came out but i didnt get what i expected the villains if you want to call them that do nothing but fill time i enjoyed matt damon stepping away from comedy movies oceans eleven to play a roll he really looks like but this wasnt very good i think this current 73 rating is just being nice glad ludlum was on the writing team when he died the good parts were his relationship with marie and the beginning this movie kept hyping up a huge showdown at the end of the movie for bourne but i was letdown as to how short the final action sequence was they could have done a better job on the ending overall if your a huge bourne fan this is for you however like me a bourne fan i wanted a little more action to it,intelligence
besides being film entertainment of the highest order enjoys two unexpected accomplishments one is that it positions matt damon as a truly multidimensional actor with a creative range usually found in actors raised in classical theater the second accomplishment is that it has delivered a rather peerless model of what a spyaction movie should look likei have rented this movie three times over the years and continue to marvel at damons performance granted he has an excellent script and ludlums story is gripping but damon hits so many high notes in his characterization of jason bourne that the viewer cant help but become emotionally involved with him we feel his frustration his helplessness his confusion his meanness and his resolve most importantly we feel his burning intelligence grappling with the amnesia that may get him killed and we find exhilaration in his physical and mental strengthtony gilroys script and doug limans direction are both masterful everything is believable from the hitech toys to the car chase to the fight scenes to the relationships between various characters to the plot development there are very few visual gimmicks to propel the story and yet the pace never lets up i found myself wondering what i would say and do in many of the situations and that means the movie drew me in that i wasnt merely a passive observer dialog was real the subplots were efficient and wellplaced the props and locations added wonderful flavor and the reliefs were perfectly timed the cast surrounding damon is a delicious smorgasbord of types with brian cox being the only usual suspect in these kinds of roleswhile ludlum is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to good story telling the way damon gilroy and liman brought it to life on screen is quite remarkable i fully intend to purchase the entire bourne series if the followups are as good as this first effort this initial film is worth multiple viewings and deserves a permanent place in anyones film library,intelligence
this sure is a great action thriller its especially better in the dvd format mainly because of the sound used in this film most dvds with dolby 51 sound are well one step up from stereo but the 51 on this movie  boy is it powerful or what it seems as if the studio checked doublechecked and triplechecked the 51 tracks just to give the viewer the ultimate surround sound experience so even if you dont own a large home theater system and you only watch your dvds through your television speakers let it be stereo or mono  or headphones and even if action movies arent your forte then watch this dvd anyway itll knock your socks off,intelligence
what a pity to waste such a good literary premise by completely uprooting the original and turning the movie into a collage of video spots of various action scenes that make no sense whatsoever and in many cases are totally unrealistic especially the ending scene furthermore and most importantly matt damon is one of the worst casting choices that i have seen in decades he has less to do with jason bourne than mickey mouse or goofy do he stars in this film playing a seasoned cia murderer looking like a confused high school kid on prom night finally as a consequence of not following the book at all the movie ends up without a storyline to follow the characters are shallow empty and therefore the viewer cannot identify and ends up not caring as to what happens to them action in itself is not enough to justify the making of a film certainly not a successful one unfortunately it seems that in hollywood nowadays they think it is,intelligence

i read robert ludlums book at the recommendation of my father i had never been a huge fan of spyespionage type stories but he assured me i would enjoy the read and enjoy i did i absolutely loved the book and was so taken with the mystery behind jason bourne when i heard that the novel was to be a movie i waited with high hopes knowing what an amazing story would be put to screenunfortunately though i was not so blown away while i realize it is hard to fit a book of 250 pages plus into a 1 12 hr film i felt that there were so many important things that were left out of the film the film got turned into just another action movie with cool fight scenes and guns while i do admit the fight scenes were choreographed well this wasnt really an action story so much of the story is about jason bourne struggling to know who he is and what he is it is a mindtrip keeping a reader turning the pages to know what is going to happen next the film gave the viewer this sense of uncertainty and mystery but not the way the book does something was lost in the film the time lapses were too short and the answers are given too quickly rather than leaving jason and the audience guessing and guessing the suspension got lost in a shootout nor does the audience really connect with jason as a character and what he is going through in the book the reader really gets inside jasons head and we are as lost as he is we discover things as he discovers them i feel that the film could have done a better job of connecting the audience to the characterover all not a bad film but if you enjoy this sort of story please read the book and the ones that follow the series is purely enjoyable,intelligence
was a quite good tv miniseries with richard chamberlain that didnt really need remaking but with all the strife i read about that went into this remake its actually a pretty serviceable hollywood thriller franka potente so good in tom tykwers german movies where she got to do a lot more has some chemistry with matt damon though clive owen who has a tiny part here would have done more complexity with the role than damon doesbut heck if the point of having a new hunk in the role is to get womens fannies in the multiplex seats more romance would have been nice evidently damon thought that interrupted the flow of the story so demanded it be taken outwell the story does in fact make more sense than most such hollywood thrillers i guess well see the deleted scenes on the dvd originally written 7142002,intelligence
this is one of the better actionthrillers ive seen in a long time its detailed and balanced and dont get to advanced and hard to follow is a decent and enjoyable movie one man with no recollection of who he is is found floating in the mediterranian with bullets in his back by some fishermen when he comes back to shore it turns out he is wanted but he dont have a clue whywhat i really liked about this movie is that you follow the character jason bourne very close you hardly vet to know more then he knows and so you kind of experience the same confusion he has now while some movies that follows characters this way may get too confusing this dont spythrilleraction movies may have a tendency to get very hightech with lots of technobabble and gadgets that can do just about anything this movie has a great lack of these elements something i find quite nice it gives you one less thing to focus on and its not necessary neither as the story is well written and the movie keeps you glued there is no need for stuff like this to cover a bad storythe cast is great matt damon does a great job as jason bourne and franka potente is a good marie they are both good characters and you get to know them just as much as you need to relate too them i think its a good idea to use european actors to act europeans and not use american as is seen a little too often it gives more credibility to the movie i can say the same for the use of actual locations like it the effects are good there really arent many special effects and thats good cause this movie dont need any it however got some pretty nice stunts and driving scenes that fits like a glove the stunts are well executed and well coordinated it simply looks good many action movies often contains a lot of blood youll find blood but not in the same amounts as in many other films like this there are also relatively little shooting never the less this movie is filled with actionthe movie is nice scored however you dont pay attention to the music in the hottest action scenes there are low or no music and in most scenes with music the music is just way back in the background its not bad so why theyve done this i dont know but it works its like the music only affects the subconscious and does so wellall in all this makes up a pretty nice actionthriller that is well worth your time,intelligence
the cia has a place called the farm and in this farm the cia train you in martial arts  gun training  role playing  muscle memory  and so forth muscle memory is when somebody throws a punch at you in a certain way it triggers a part in your brain and you basically triggers certain strikes in martial artsthe secret service is trained in the same thing soldiers are trained in the same thing anyways the farm actually exists thats were they train you to become an assain and in most cases your generally recruited also the cia holds job fairs only at ivy league schools and you usually have to have a good grade point average to get in the cia  but not to be an assain the farm is somewhere in virgina and as far as money goes theres no way in hell there going to pay an assain a lot of money as far as the cia is concerned your government property blah blah blah i said what i wanted to say,intelligence
well i think the best point about the story is bourne is not identified till the end just imagine if u are a spy if u are doing some mission u aint really know exactly what u are and what u are really doing isnt so thats the point which bourne identity caught so that makes the movie different from other spy movies isnt it i have few collection of action movies actually but as soon as i watched it i started to like it and i watched it again from time to time the actor matt damons skill is well charactered in this movie as well as he did in the other movie called the talented mrripley he isnt cold hearted but he acted also not over warm hearted just well,intelligence
a young man is washed ashore badly injured and not knowing who he is and what he is all about what is worse he seems to have a band of hit men on his trailill keep this short because this isnt a movie you want to linger on long we have seen everything before and we have seen everything before and better and to be fair we have seen it all before and worsea very good example of those excuse plots that allows you to throw everything and the kitchen sink at the screen this simply skips around europe having mini setups and mini climaxes that serve no purpose other than to provide cheap although i bet the producers didnt think so thrills not that this is all of a bad thing matt damion is quite good baby faced and non showy he gets the job done without exposing too many of his acting bones you can hardly win oscars playing a man who doesnt know who he is himselfthis chooses to use natural and half light which makes things look more real but had me squinting at my television set the much discussed car chase is good but nothing that you would want to pay to see againi found myself filing this one under contrived and forgettable,intelligence
i realized i liked this when i was willing to watch it on commercial tv and i had already seen it in the theater interesting exciting thriller with international setting the damonpotente pairing made it special like redforddunaway in 3 days of the condor a similar story the action scenes are just a little different from the usual how did they get so many good actors for a relatively routine story free trip to europe like redford damon isnt usually labeled a great actor although both have consistently been convincing in entertaining movies im glad they made this movie the book is too long maybe thats why so many books are so long encourage people to see the inevitable movie instead,intelligence
while i mostly agree with sleels comments about realism there is one scene which stretches reality a bitits where he kicks the guy he beat senseless into the stairwell and rides him down the drop shooting the guy coming up after him between the eyes it would have been more believable if he hit anywhere else except there a small point but a point nonethelessit doesnt bother me that it departs from the novels as good as they are the mini cooper chase scenes have elements of the italian job which are very cool driving down narrow alleys staircases on to sidewalks etcstill loved the movie and plan on seeing bourne supremacy soon,intelligence
probably one of the best action movies to have come out since action was mainstream in the 80s in this movie we see matt damon break out of his cute dreamboat shell and into an action movie specialist this movie also contains a very special gem franka potente mostly known for her role in run lola run frankas character in this movie made her into one of the most mysterious sexiest actresses in hollywood in my opinion why she isnt cast in more role is beyond me this movie is basically about an exassassin who is is struck with amnesia after a mission goes wrong his mission now is to find out who he is the story couldnt be better the action couldnt be better and the onscreen chemistry between damon and potente is hot very hot a must see for anyone into action flicks this one ranks way up there when it comes to this category,intelligence
of course the plot is catching more than everything else nevertheless hollywood should descend more in europe to shoot movies that would bear the old continents mark which is exactly a point this movie makes distribution is great though matt damon is not exactly looking like the forceful hero on screen he should have been more credible as a tough guy eliminating further some of the hollywood action movie clichs could have helped but this film is worth seeing and a little bit of reflection on real life untold stories wouldnt ruin anybodys day one could even develop a taste for asking more of the same if not better,intelligence
assassin loses his memory and tries to get it back while cia is out to kill him unfortunately amnesia doesnt exist  its just a fiction of novels and movies people dont lose their memory of themselves for weeks at a time while retaining how to talk and read and drive a car the only way to make someone forget who they are is to pretty much destroy the brain to where they cant do anythingdamon is good as the assassin on the run  his fight scenes are great his girl friend played by somebody i never heard of is a waste shes not needed for the story and shes not even very pretty i did like how the cia is portrayed as a bunch of ruthless monsters who will kill anyone who gets in their way like i said its a paranoia movieone ridiculous episode in the movie is when damon is on the top of a staircase and is in a gun fight with an assassin 30 feet below damon grabs a dead body and throws it over the balcony and then rides the body to the ground floor using it as a cushion to break his fall thats farfetched enough but on the way down he shoots the assassini give this a b,intelligence
probable spoilermy husband read the book i did not but i recall him saying that the book was incredibly convoluted  and this movie probably would have benefited from some more of that or perhaps it was too convoluted for me and i missed something because i felt that the ending was a cheat we spent the whole movie worrying about one thing and it is quite true that a lot of people seemed interested in killing jason bourne  only to find that all of this was really about something elsei like matt damon as an actor but have trouble buying into him in a role like this my fault  he looks to be about 18 and just seems too young to be so accomplished still he did a good job with this i saw his compassion as well as his confusion and determination and i thought the chase scene was excellentloved the shots of paris  so often either my husband or i would exclaim weve been there its about as good a film as ive seen for showing off the citybut over all when it was over i felt disappointed,intelligence
this film was great at the cinema so i thought id buy it on dvd in anticipation of the sequel ii bourne in the usathe film begins with starts with matt damascilis floating in the mediterranean sea like a little boat he is picked up by a bigger fishing boat that takes him to europe considered by many to be an even bigger boat from then onwards matt daemon wonders around europe looking lost and you realize that matt deadman is like harrison ford and arnold schwarzenegger in that hes best when hes wondering around a foreign place looking lost the action scenes come approximately every 15 minutes and are so stripped down and visceral it makes you feel like your face has become a wire brush and youre sweeping up someones shinbone in a dirty teapot factorybut the best handled scenes are the dialoguebased ones where you realize director doug liman has taken a leaf out of the cinema du cahiers truffant godard et al book and chooses to let silence permeate and the camera drift this pacing is unusual in action films and it works to the films advantage and you react to the action scenes with genuine surprisethe film somehow adds up to more than the sum of its parts its not that good but somehow leaves the impression that its a much better movie its kind of like eating a mcdonalds it seems enjoyable but when you ask yourself why you just come to the conclusion that it wasnt enjoyable at all and you just feel all empty inside,intelligence
please dont read this unless youve seen the movieive seen this movie a halfdozen times now since i got it and i think ive figured out why i keep finding it appealing and entertainingat one level its a pretty good popcorn thriller with gunplay fights car chases the whole nine yards theres a pulsing tense driving electronic score with some good strings thrown in that supports the sometimes overthetop action scenes weve seen it all before but its done well and it worksbut at another level we have a story of a guy who wakes up after being pulled out of the ocean literally born get it this guy doesnt doesnt know who he is who his parents or family are where he came from and he cant remember any event in his life he experienced before he woke up despite all this he can read and write speak many languages and kick butt on anybody who dares to mess with him he has survival skills to die for to top it off he has an led display sown into his hip that a displays a swiss bank account number full of cash and passports that allow him to travel anywhere and assume any identity he would ever needso in the process of trying to overcome his amnesia he meets a young woman who seems to be only marginally better off than he is she is rootless and currently homeless living out of her tiny car she has lived like a gypsy flitting from one place to another in a seeming quest to find out what she wants to do with her life it turns out that each has something to offer to the other he has cash a paris apartment and an amazing resourcefulness that is a mystery to them both she has a car to help him elude the shadowy people who are chasing him she also has an intact memory of her life which will help him in a critical way towards the end of the moviewe identify with the bourne character because all of us are born into the uncaring world helpless yet with some innate skills we acquire language and mobility in a way that is amazing and mysterious to anyone who has ever had kids yet we also need help bourne finds himself reborn into the world gifted in many ways yet unable to really survive without help the woman he meets becomes a sort of mother to him and enables him to find his feet in the hostile world where he finds himselfi think weve seen this sort of story told before in many ways but i credit ludlum for placing it in the spy thriller contextoh and by the way the boy does get the girl at the end of the movie what more could you ask for,intelligence
the bourne films identity supremacy spy thrillers full of action fun to watch if you suspend all disbeliefmatt damon is a better actor rainmaker good will hunting than is really required here but cmon he deserves to star in a couple of schlock movies popular with the thrillseeking masses i might even qualify as one on occasionthis is supposed to be fun so please dont bother us with hypercritical detailed analyses which tend to ruin our enjoyment anyway a big part of the enjoyment ultraquick fight and car chase scenes just relax and get into em just ignore the obvious hollywood patterns the predictable love scene the evil cia spymasters etcjust relax and enjoy the bourne films,intelligence
despite what it thinks of itself bourne identity is an old fashioned spy thriller with a slight psychological overtone and a substantial helping of actionthe film picks up out on a rough sea and a fishing boat which spots a body floating in the choppy water on recovering the man the crew find out hes alive and lay him out to rest the doctor presumably removes 2 bullets from the mans back and a strange lazer device from his neckhead on waking the man realises he has absolutely no idea who he is and his only clue is the lazer device on docking he begins to realize he has skills beyond what most people do with a heightened level of physique and instinct bourne identity sees the man jason bourne set out to discover his identity and to find out what happened to him aided and abetted by marie a drifter he encounters at the american embassy in switzerlandmatt damon puts in a pretty good turn as bourne and looks suitably confused by the general situation and the events going on around him and franka potente is reasonable as marie  certainly convincing enough for the purposes of this type of filmthe action is pretty exciting in general but it suffers from the god syndrome as bourne himself is so damn skilled he never seems in danger at all so its not as thrilling as it should bethe plot comes thick and fast and never lets up but the problem is there are a few aspects which are decidedly confusing and the ending feels a bit nicey nicey and hollowits a decent enough ride but ultimately i didnt get much out of it,intelligence
i loved it matt damon is very convincing as an action star the action in this movie really hurts there are no overblown sequences like parachute jumping or airplanes crashing into casinos instead there are gritty handtohand grappling sequences where bourne is able to disarm security guards with his empty hands the first of these scenes is very interesting  it takes place outside and for some reason bourne rediscovers his abilities and muscle memory as a killing machine when he incapacitates two night officershis boss conklin after being disturbed by the unusual turn of events that took place after bourne failing his mission decides to call on other hit men to take bourne out and with this tony gilroy is able to incorporate action and plot where bourne easily memorizes a map and drives through the city fleeing policemen and running in the line of fire of an assassin after he distracts him by blasting a grill with a shotgun with the scenes of marie we get to learn how caring and compassionate and compassionate a hitman jason bourne really is he cares for the kids he sacrifices his sleep just to do so this of course really pays off in the end when bourne remembers why he failed the mission of equono wombosigilroys screenplay deviates from ludlums novel  set in another era when carlos the jackal sanchez was still a fugitive gilroy obviously perceived that none of us can relate to that kind of story today instead he comes up with a very engaging plot about a professional killer with amnesia running from his own coemployees trying to investigate who he really is why people are after him and what was that mission he failed to carry out anywayacting is topnotch so is the direction there are stylized reverse cutins or cutouts especially towards the end but used to great effect doug liman proves that less is morei loved mobys song in the end910 grade a,intelligence
this movie just oozes classexcept maybe for the very beginning in the boat scenes  but they too were well constructed however another viewing is needed to comprehend the alternate beginning offered on my dvd damon is almost perfectly cast and im not even a huge fan of his but top marks to the paris scenery which adds something that would just not have been possible had it been adapted to be filmed in the usathe realism is impressive too nice to see a ford escort get rammed instead of some obscure american car blowing up in a ball of fire after only a slight impact as is the case in so many americaset movies cant wait for the bourne supremacy,intelligence
possible spoilersfor fans of the book do not watch this version expecting a remake of the roger young version with richard chamberlain it is a well crafted script that is based on aspects of the book but it is not the book brought to filmpersonally the action was done well  and the chase scenes are among the better vehicle chases but if there were any attempts to wring any emotional elements from the script they were unfortunately found lackingthe other bourne was more calculating and human whilst this newer bourne is a better assassin watching both will detract from neither as they are different enough not to be confused with each other,intelligence
spoilersin 1997 when oscar winning good will hunting was released nobody could have predicted just how well its two writers and stars will have done in life afterwards whilst ben affleck would release an inconsistent catalogue of films it was his friend matt damon who would become ever more popular as the amnesiast assassin jason bourneset almost throughout in france tells the story of jason bourne being rescued from the sea surrounding marseilles bourne awakes with two bullet wounds in his back an electric chip quite literally in his shoulder and a distinctive lack of memory traveling around the country looking for clues to his life bourne encounters beautiful gypsy marie franka potente and the two grow closer as they attempt to escape from the police and assassins who are following thembased to some degree on the first book of robert ludlums bourne trilogy is a clever thriller featuring intense moments of passion ingenuity and characterisation whilst far from perfect the film moves at a suitable enough pace to never really get boring and to keep the audience entertainedthe ultimate beauty of is simply that it has some superb performances as bourne matt damon is absolutely brilliant giving the role a suitable amount of mystery and confusion whilst never saying very much bourne like fellow assassin the professor the wonderful clive owen never says much unless he feels it is necessary as a result we are given a leading character who shows a remarkable vary of emotions through little speech or facial shapefinally the best thing about bourne is that he refreshes the slowly dying spy movie category whilst recent james bond films have been pathetic and excessively farcical bourne saves the genre by adding a sense of reluctance and realism to the notion of the spy preferring to avoid confrontation and seeking a quiet life bourne shows an intense dislike for the world of espionage in contrast bond spends a considerable amount of time trying to sleep with female spies mess with obscure gadgets all location cars and pens which fire bullets anyone and killing as many henchmen as possible this daft view on spying has slowly ruined an always popular genre therefore its satisfying for bourne to breed new life into itin conclusion then is a quality film whilst far from perfect the film refreshing interest in espionage by treating us to some superb characterisation and some impressive stunts with a decent plot as well this film is a suitable introduction to ludlums books well worth a look,intelligence
has doubtless good points its a modern spy story led by two young charismatic actors matt damon and franka potente theres suspense and mystery action scenes arent too exaggerated and violence is very mild on the other hand the movie has too many slow moments we begin to understand the plot unless youve already read the robert ludlum book more or less after one hour dialogues are not very well written and the interest is not very high sometimes we hope that the action goes fasterthe film is another attempt to recreate spy movies but the film has neither the sophistication nor the entertainment of the james bond franchise,intelligence
ok this movie above all others has torn me in two different directions on one side i see this movie and am insulted and angered by the complete lack of any resemblance at all to the book the main antagonist from the book is completely left out the movie love interest is a polar opposite to the book love interest bourne in the book was at least 1520 years older than damon andwellnever mind ill just leave off by saying that the only similarities between the book and the movie were the characters names and the amnesia part ive always disliked movies that completely corrupted a books story but if you can disassociate this story from the book or if you have never read the book then this movie is actually pretty good its a thinker as well as an action flick its just fast paced enough to avoid falling into plodding along but slow enough to let you absorb the few facts that the director lets you have damon surprised me in this movie as i fully expected him to be pathetic in the bourne role but he did quite well given the circumstances now if i could just decide whether to be insulted or love the movie i would be happy,intelligence
i enjoyed the movie for what it is an action movie that happens to have the same title as a robert ludlum book and for which names of certain characters of the book were reused in the movie  that is about the extent of any link between the book and the movieoverall as someone who has read the bourne trilogy years ago and liked it i expected something closer to the tv film made in the 90s  it actually corresponded to the book in a reasonable way  this movie although it uses the title tells a whole different story with characters that are so substantially different that it really doesnt have much to do with ludlums creation other than some basic ideasif you want to see a rather nice action movie or have not read the book youll probably like this movie  if you read the book and expect to see something that follows the basic storyline you might want to skip the movie,intelligence
one of the notable aspects of this mystery thriller is its good cast with matt damon in the title role followed by franka potente and decent supporting roles by oscarwinner chris cooper the underrated brian cox and an underused julia stiles once again damon drives the film onward playing an amnesiac wellequipped with wall scaling abilities of spiderman martial arts moves of bruce lee and the spy  driving skills of james bondcool huh of course there is a flip to that coin as you will understand when you view the spectacle another aspect is the solid direction of doug liman who kept that delicate balance of action and storytelling from veering too much to either side the production also had good taste to film on location in europe car chases and other brief yet vivid fights highlight the movie for those action fans and enough mystery in the script to keep those brain gears turning anyhow it seems undeniable that damon can act in comparison to his best friend ben affleck and as long as there is good writing ace casting and decent directors why didnt liman stay on as director for the sequel to follow i look forward to the next one,intelligence
i read the book and loved and of course was excited when i finally saw this movie but come to find out they killed a really good storysurprise surprise major parts were either cut out or changed completely along with characters that were essential in the book so when it was done i watched a special feature in which the director spoke and he said he didnt want the movie to be anything like the book then why in gods name did you buy the rights i can answer that he didnt want someone to make a movie that was 10 time better i like matt damon it wasnt his fault the director and heads of the movie studio are idiots the fight scenes were boring any major fight scenes from the book were not included and all in all a lot of the movie was badly acted,intelligence
all in all this is a great action flick  the way its shot written and edited add to the entire story in a great way  whenever i see another action movie announced like this one its easy for me to just throw it in the same category with all the other pure action movies with a plots so thin that they rip when you think about them however this movie broke that mold for me by having a good story with great action scenes and characters that you can sypathize with i think its one of the best action movies to come out in a long time  its definately one of my favorites in this genrei look forward to seeing how they continue the story with bourne supremicy,intelligence
this is one of the best action films made in the last ten years  it is the result of a charming and unlikely convergence of capable indie film players doug liman swingers go decided that for his third film he wanted to tackle  with liman at the helm matt damon signed onto a movie that he otherwise would not have been interested in  the two of them convinced the studio to cast franka potente well known german actress from run lola run as the female lead even though she was not widely known to american audiences  add chris cooper julia stiles and clive owen all respectable actors but not glamorous hollywood stars and youve got talent everywhere you look in a genre that is usually defined by cookiecutter plots fluff acting and overthetop direction think mission impossible 2  most of the film is shot on location in paris and damon even does all of his own stunts  all of this really shows  this is a mentally engaging film that doesnt spoonfeed you an imbecilic plot  it is character driven focusing on damon and potentes reactions to an intrigue in which they are increasingly entangled while the intrigue itself is secondary but solidly put together it features one of the better car chases in film in recent years which features an old mini as opposed to the boring bmw commercial in the italian job  no slow motion or shaky cam just quick well shot action sequences  also the screenwriters did a great job updating the plot from the novel which was published in 1980 the same is not true of the sum of all fears another movie released in 2002 but based on a novel from the mid 80s  is entertaining from start to finish 910,intelligence
im not usually a fan of action movies but i do enjoy ones like this one that have a motive and some suspense to it as opposed to all the standard blowing crap up just for cool special effects is wellcrafted and the scenery is absolutely beautiful matt damon gives his finest performance to date as jason bourne a man who washes up on a boat at sea and has no clue who he is however he begins to discover some of his previous life and learns that he was a cia trained assassin howeverhis mission that he was supposed to carry out was a failure and now the cia is after him at any means possible so they can cover their own asses chris cooper does a fine job as the mastermind trying to bring bourne down and he helps the movie have such an eerie feel to it this movie gets an 8 out of 10 for me for being different and the chase scenes are intense the scene at marias friends house was awesome what with the one on one hunt and all the sequel looks to be actionpacked as well i didnt even know these movies were based on a set of books even though now they are on my must read list,intelligence
great completely superb this was a oneofakind movie i think this was a great action movie one of the best ive ever seen matt damon did a great job in acting and so as franca potente they both did a great job the movie is enjoyable from beginning to the end there was no boring part this movie was just what i expected to see the beginning the middle and the end of the movie were greatmatt damon plays as a cia agent who lost his memory in a mission which he was never able to complete successfully after this he goes through a lot of stuff and action while trying to recover his memoryyo cant miss this movie,intelligence
spy thrillers can be either good or bad when theyre just mass produced see also the recruit they becoming boring no matter how hard they try is certainly not the elite in spy movies thats a fact but it at least seems more sophisticated than others loosely thankfully based on robert ludlums ridiculously absurd novel its what youd expect from a summer action movie but it has a little more into it not enough to make it a classic but enough to make it worth your two hoursjason bourne matt damon washes ashore with no memory of who he was or how he got there he realizes that he was a spy for the cia but now for some reason the american government is trying to hunt him down he teams up with marie franka potente and tries to figure out who he is why hes running and how to defeat his pursuersludlums novel was too long too confusing had too many characters and was just plain silly thank god the american public is stupid so the book would be dumbed down for the movie version theres little development on any character except bourne especially not on anyone in the ciawas that julia stiles the plot could use some working on and at times it seemed a little hard to believe but theres action to spare and its all pretty exciting damon isnt really the make of an action hero which works with his character since hes just supposed to blend in i just hope this doesnt go to his head and he starts thinking he should be the next arniethe obligatory car chase scene was pretty cool although there was much product placement bmw and minis its all pretty standard but its not subpar the rest of the action scenes were pretty intense and exciting with the screen being used to its full potential on that note let me give kudos to director doug liman his choice of shots worked very well and it was obvious to see what he was trying to achieve in each shot why he didnt sign on to direct the sequel i dont know but is good enough in its own rightwhat people want out of an action movie plus the addition of a pretty good character jason bournemy rating 710rated pg13 for violence and some language,intelligence
i thought the movie was very good one of the few i have watched more than once this is also one of the few movies that being nothing like the book was excellent on its own the fight scenes seemed well choreographed and the plot had no dull moments what a car chase i was only a little disappointed that the extended edition only had an alternate beginning and end and no extra scenes put back in the middle not counting the cut scenes i will say that for me the alternate beginning and ending change the whole feeling of what jason and marie will do  can anyone help me with a soundtrack question in the extended edition alternate ending what song is playing i cant seem to find it in the credits thanks in advance,intelligence
the bourne idenity is a tale of a black operations assasin with amnesia who is being hunted by several mob factions including the cia  the gun play in the film takes a back seat to fine weaved plot this film doesnt make the mistakes of earlier films like ronin has great action and adventure but this isnt another mile a minute die hard movie instead of insulting your intelligence the conjure up a wonderful piece of brain candy which appeals to those who like a thinking persons film the plot is thrown out like a puzzle as viewers watch as the director and the producers connect the pices of bournes identity and how he was left for dead in the opening i recommend this film to all robert ludlum fans and fans who liked mission impossible 1 i also recommend this to fans of the spy genre,intelligence
this movie has one of the best openings for an action film and the ending is one that restores faith in the movie industry then they had to screw it up spoilers belowthe alternate beginning and ending on the dvd release are horrible they blow all of the suspense and drama from the whole film will he survive will she yeah thats right of course he does because the whole movie is a flashback thanks a lot ive seen 7th graders write better plot movement than thatlets talk about the alternate ending sometimes we need monsters theyre basically saying jasons whole crisis of character brought on by his being confronted with the children of his target is moot now post 911 because we need monsters so whats the whole point of the film now the only monsters i see are the ones who messed up this films integrity what were you thinking,intelligence
i was reluctant to see this movie having seem the miniseries and wondering how they could possibly  condense it further into a two hour film  i finally got around to watching this movie and wasnt impressedthe action was okenough to hold your attention but matt damon and franka potente are poor substitutes for richard chamberlain and jacklyn smith damon and potente either ham it up or display no emotion at allthese are two people who are best seen but not heard  and whats the deal with julia stiles  what the heck was her role in all this  i never understood thatguess they just needed a young blonde for demographics,intelligence
inspired by robert ludlums novels supremacy and legacy revolves around jason bourne an amnesiastricken individual in search of his true identity and seemingly on the run from almost everyonejason is rescued by a group of fishermen who find him at sea injured from multiple gunshot wounds and on the brink of death while jasons amnesia doesnt allow him to remember why he was at sea where he lives or even where he works he eventually picks up several clues that lead him to believe that he is a government agent and on the run from the very same people that trained him to become an invisible weaponbourne decides that he no longer wants to be government property and revolts and gains assistance from marie helena kreutz a woman with her fair share of problems but in desperate need of income which jason offers in return for her helpfor those of you who thoroughly enjoyed the farfetched unrealistic scenes in other spy films like the james bond series and triple x theres a chance you wont enjoy this film a large part of the film is spent in developing the bourne character and on unraveling the information behind his cryptic past however the film does have several action sequences especially enjoyable are the vehicle chases between bourne and paris police through the streets of paris a chase sequence that won the coveted taurus award from the world stunt awards in 2003overall amazing european scenery a beautiful soundtrack composed by john powell along with tracks from other artists scattered throughout the film and a convincing cast matt damon chris cooper franka potente make this spy film a lasting one and a good setup for its subsequent titles such as the bourne supremacy 2004overall 871 categories story 90 entertainment 85 script 80 soundtrack 95 acting 85 set and design 90 sequences 85,intelligence
i really loved the movie so i went to read the booksi dont like ludlums writing style much but the books definitely go into far more detail and show that the movie was significantly altered to fit modern political scenery as in no more soviet unionthe point is one that is often the case i think that the movie is a grade a movie and quite enjoyable but the books which are grade b for me but probably a for others are significantly different dont try to experience one and assume the other will be the sameim even more pensive about the bourne supremacy as the trailers and previews i have seen so far seem to leave out most of the first half of the booki strongly wish hollywood was more forgiving of 3 and 4 hour movies or was more willing to see things put out in volumes like kill bill which i never though i would cite  so that books can be given full treatments lord of the rings and kill bill were successes  a book like the bourne novels usually have good logical divisions around 12 way through they definitely need more time to fully flesh out the background,intelligence
this version is radically different than the book and the television miniseries starring richard chamberlain but it is much better than the tv version and even though it strays far from the book it stands on its own as a great action thrillerleave it to doug liman best known for swingers to put together a highly charged action movie with lots of energy and panache damon is good as bourne franka potente is sweet and charming as his unwitting and unwilling accomplice and brian cox is always solid in his familiar intelligence official caught up in a big mess role that he has played in five or six movies alreadythis is a very good movie and definitely the best adaptation of a ludlum book so far even with all of the changes,intelligence
is matt damons most meaningless role ever although damons character jason bourne is a great spytype figure in terms of his ability to survive an onslaught of guys who want to kill him i really just had zero interest in the character itself i know other guys will respond with well who cares about character development thats not the point its just supposed to be a fun action movie but ive seen matt damon take roles that werent supposed to be complex and turn a decent movie into a good one by doing something with the character if youve seen talented mr ripley for example you might be disappointed with damons role here             there are a couple pluses to the film as i mentioned earlier there are some action sequences here that would make james bond jealous and a car chase that could rival the french connection theres also a love story going on which is nicely lowkey staying in the background id even say this could have been a really good action movie if only the action star would have lived up to his potential,intelligence

goodwill hunting 2 hunting season ever wonder what would have happened to will hunting had he taken that job with the cia he would have been turned into the ultimate spy weapon matt damon has really made a niche for himself playing talented genius liars all the suspense of the talented mr ripley with 20 less of the homosexual overtonesin all seriousness this was an entertaining film with wit and solid action i largely ignored this film for a great deal of time and only watched it after a friends recommendation on dvd im glad i took the time this film has great european settings intelligent pacing tightly filmed solutions to what seems to be an endless amount of escapes that jason bourne needs to makes the character due to his memory loss has an interesting fourth dimension in his personality than your run of the mill bond knockoff superspy franka potente is an odd but beautiful fit into the role of marie in character motivations that laugh in the face of logical thinking she makes it work nice save franka chris cooper is a shallow underdeveloped yet oddly hateable movie villain while this movie is a b list actors blue heaven extremely confusing to me was the reasoning behind casting julia styles  cant win them alltons of questions were left open at the end of the film i suppose under the assumption that a sequel would be made the bourne supremacy too much or maybe oddly not enough time was spent developing 1 the motives of the cias immediate need to kill him 2 the only real problem i have with this film is the extremely implausible awkward relationship between bourne and marie im going to just let the small stuff go and enjoy the film if you worry too much about why he doesnt at least put a hat on or ditch the red bag grow upyeah time is short so they just cut right to the chase literally hey thats fine with me the film works on many levels plenty of oh hell no moments it made me want to read the book for the details and it definitely made me interested in the sequel if its as good as this film id say a wonderful franchise has been bourne,intelligence
this is a fantastic film and i would recommend it to anyone i would strongly encourage picking up the book and reading that as wellalso if you are not a matt damon fan i would urge you to reconsider your thoughts about him he does a great job every which way he goes and is yet to let me down as though he is working for my approvalif you have not seen this movie and are about to rent it you are in for a good one general america should like this one and its sequel they are simple action films with a slight hint of conspiracy a dash of love and plenty of jason bourne getting chased around and figuring out how to get around themthats it,intelligence
if you can get past the fact that this movie departs from robert ludlums book after about 10 minutes its fun  my son and i were both expecting the same story so we were quite irked  the tv movie with richard chamberlain and jacklyn smith was very close to the bookill be interested to see how the sequel works since the ending of the movie had no relationship whatever to the book  but what the heck first blood the novel killed rambo and the movie shall we say did noti liked everything about the movie except the ruination of the story  but i also have noclue how wet work black ops and so on are done despite growing up a few miles from langley va and being taught by the wives of the men who ran it,intelligence
ludlums book was a dense sometimes bizarre story that focused not only on action but psychology why was bourne doing what he was doing what was the cia thinking as it tried to bring him in would carlos the jackal kill him even though bourne couldnt remember who he was etc the film dumbs down the plot considerably and loses much of what made the book a terrific read that said the film is quite enjoyable damon and potente are good as the leads chris cooper is always terrific and brian cox and julia styles are fine in smaller roles the action sequences are fun the portrayal of the african leader borders on the offensive but all in all a good film but not nearly up to the level of the book,intelligence
there have been an awfully lot of movies with spies in them a few have managed to drop the shiny chrome and perfume glitz of the bond series to reveal that spies are peoplethe bourne i watched is an antispy movie you watch a man with amnesia no smooth patter no cocktails no grey suit no suave automobile not even a coat wearing a sweater with two bullet holes in the back try to discover what he did to discover those holesjason discovers with considerable horror what and who he was yeah hes not adverse to using his valuable training a 30milliondollar weapon his former boss calls him in selfdefense as the film throws him a series of deadly threatsthroughout we see the human side of bourne confronting the reality of his cool mechanical warriorhood  a nightmare hes trying to wake up from we see the event that changed his life uncoveredthere are some aspects of the bourne character reacting to a nightmare reality that very much parallel the awakening of neo in the matrix you could watch this movie simply as an actionpaced suspense but bourne strives to unravel the carefully crafted seduction of the phoney bond image here the suave professional killer is recognized to be little better than a dehumanized junkyard dog doing the bidding of its master a completely amoral and disposable human being serving his master ruthlesslyahhhhh,intelligence
great action movie  the movie history is not the same which i read at the book the screenplay uses the idea of robert ludlum but tell another history without some details but too interesting matt damon proofs to be a great actor he is perfect as jason bourne his lost air is very convincent fight coreography are very well done car scenes are good well how can a supermini  and superold  down that stairs  franka potente is good on the role but there are here so much differences between the movie and the book as wrote by ludlum marie was a strong positive and smart woman which never give up when must to help bourne doing all the necessary and has no fear marie of the movie is most fragile and only one time when she gets him the informations about mr kane she shows some help capacity she has fear and when bourne talk her to leave and give her the money she simply leaves just like yes thats ok im living so long or so neverok self protection is a basic instinctand is so strong but is no appropriated to this personrole i mean j bournes personality is the same as created by lundlum maries isnt but is yet a great movie  see it,intelligence
bourne identy is a good movie i will say that first  i enjoyed it as an action film  but as a story it lacked  what did it lack read the book  the book tells the story so well it really pulls you in  i watched the movie and thought wow this is a cool idea i bet that the movie left out a lot yeah it did in fact in reading the book and comparing it to the movie i felt like i was reading a whole different story based on the same idea  so my suggestion watch the movie first and enjoy all the action and excellent filming and acting then read the book and think wowwhat a story i would give the movie a 67 out of 10,intelligence
matt damons character here seems to be built a bit upon both his earlier will hunting and tom ripley personas  talented clever skillful and adaptable damons hero manages to glide with ease through this rather elaborate action yarn however theres sneaky suspicion that a lot of this has been seen before it plays like a compilation of bits and pieces from other scenarios without having either a distinctive point of view or making an original statementthus we have a great car chase through the city various assassins and kickass encounters popping up periodically to shake things a bit and of course an inevitable romance in the midst of such hairraising happeningswe also have a lead actor who despite his still somewhat unformed sqeaky clean image manages to invest such commitment to his work that we tend to go along with him  its partly natural charisma and partly strong dedication to his projects that project into the theaterwith deficits detracting from assets we end with a plusminus drama of lost identity amidst strategic unfoldment  viewers responses will probably likewise tend toward wide division with ,intelligence
this is a slick intelligent and enjoyably old fashioned spy flick in modern times good conspiracyespionage thrillers have been few and far between some decent ones have included spy game enemy of the states and mission impossible while these were good and atmospheric there was something rather overblown and typically hollywood about all of them from very convoluted storylines to over the top action scenes the didnt seem grounded in reality does however it is far more believable as a piece of conspiracy entertainmentthe plot is fairly simple its a onedimensional story in a good sense in that it follows a clear pattern from start to finish without digressing too much into other storylines the subplots dont tend to interfere with the main plot the story involves jason bourne he is found at sea floating unconscious with two bullets in his back and a laser pen in his leg that when shone upon a wall for example shows the address of a bank in switzerland and also an account number when he is pulled out of the water by fisherman he is near death but is saved however when he is recovered a problem still remains he has no memory of who he is he does things instinctively that ordinary people wouldnt like speak several languages martial arts and he wants to know why so bourne starts at the bank the address of which was implanted in his thigh the plot basically follows bourne thusly on a quest to discover who he is and more importantly what he does for a living that requires him to be proficient in martial arts weapons training escape tactics and also requires about twenty different passports with different names which confuses him no end along the way he employs marie franke potente to drive him from switzerland to paris after discovering he lives there at the same time it turns out that they have been targeted by the cia for termination because bourne as it turns out was a hired assassin who botched a very hush hush job and so when he suddenly turns up alive he was assumed dead they want him out the picture for reasons of national security and to save their own bacon the planned hit was not authorised from the top shall we say the way the plot unfolds is excellent we are always a step ahead of what bourne knows and there are plenty of twists along the way and the film is excellently placedwhat i love about this film is that it evokes memories of spy flicks from the 60s films from the likes of frankenheimer and great films like the ipcress file that are far more grounded than escapist spy films like bond director doug liman has done a great job here the film is old fashioned spy thriller with a modern edge to it the european wintry locations create a great atmosphere particularly in france which really evokes the feeling of a frankenheimer film the action is good too including a superbly staged escape from the swiss embassy which has some lovely intelligent touches he steals a radio from a guard to listen in on security to keep one step ahead of them while they chase him and he tears a map of fire exits off the wall a studies it as he goes along there is also a great car chase reminiscent of the italian job hes driving a mini and once again the lovely touch of having him study a map quickly before he decides to accelerate away from on coming police there are great touches like this throughout that give us an indication of how a cia hitman might be trained to think and act beyond an average citizenthe cast are good matt damon makes a good action man here particularly as the part requires a level of relatability that you wouldnt get from an action star his performance is good and as bourne he is likeable and we are along for the ride as he aims to discover who he really is damon is cool here the part gives him ample opportunity to kick ass and he does with gusto also starring is franke potente as his initially apprehensive right hand man or woman should i say im a fan of potente i love her accent and she has a great particularly nonhollywood presence she really caught my eye on run lola run a great film and she is good here also good are chris cooper and brian cox as cia bigwigs who may have bitten off more than they can chew and could find themselves in hot water should bourne suddenly turn up at headquarters hence they go to great lengths to bump him offall in all a great old fashioned thriller its well paced exciting clever and leaves you wanting to see more the may have given in to a hollywood ending the very last scene the winddown but overall its one of the thrillers out in years ,intelligence
this movie has a very interesting plot which kept me on the edge of my seat until the end while ending was not unexpected the path to it took many unexpected twists and turns the movie did have its shortcomings i didnt like the performance of julia stiles she didnt seem to fit the part there were also problems with realism when matt damon is picked out of the sea he has no clothes yet when he leaves the boat he has a set of perfectly fitted clothes and shoes near the end there is an explanation of how he wound up in the sea but the explanation was not clear and i never understood why and having a dvd and replaying it i still could not figure it out there were a couple of scenes cut from the movie that should have been left in to improve the continuity otherwise it was enjoyable and worth watching,intelligence
opens with a body floating in the water we view this body from underneath through the water as intermittent flashes of lighting give it definition soon the stranger is picked up by a fishing vessel and here two bullets are removed from his back a laserpointer containing a swiss bank safebox number is removed from his hipthe stranger travels to zurich to retrieve the contents of the safebox he finds a bench to sleep on and when prodded by police he takes them out in a quick series of punches and kicks that surprise even him inside the deposit box he finds all the items needed to be a figure of international intrigue inside he discovers his name jason bourne other items include passports from several countries a collection of world currencies as well as a gun bourne collects these items sans the gun and leaves that bank he is followed to the us embassy where the action beginsinside the american embassy in zurich we get our first view of marie played excellently by franka potente run lola run the princess and the warrior bourne takes notice but continues on as he is being pursued when cornered bourne once again finds himself to be a lean mean fighting machine by taking out several security cards without a second thought bourne makes an escape from the embassy that is a nailbiting cinematic experience this scene which was free from music or any other distractions solidified the directors talent in my mind this guy is goodoutside the embassy bourne runs into marie yet again he offers her money in return for a ride to paris where jason bourne lives marie agrees and together they go forward to unravel the mystery along the way we are treated to a glimpse inside the cia as a man by the name of conklin chris cooper begins to track down bournethe film flows briskly and is full of human moments that raised it to a level above and beyond what your typical action film rests at the casting is excellent across the board although the use of julia stiles seems to have been a waste the direction as said before is excellent the music adds to the film overall this is first and foremost is a drama about a man trying to discover not only who he is but why he is his past is the only way he can figure out what his future should bethe films only flaw is that when we finally figure it all out its nowhere near as exciting as the journey there with such tight drama carefully executed and believable action including a nailbiting classicstyle car chase through paris one would expect a simple yet satisfying ending while we get both it is just not enough this flaw though is not enough to justify not seeing the film it is an intelligent fun ride that demands at least one viewing,intelligence
modern day life contemporises this ludlum tale written way back in the 80s the car chase sequence in paris is the highlight of the film reminiscent of the italian job and ronin matt damon goes through his part almost lifelessly compared with richard chamberlain in the tv version same goes for franka potente run lola run who is the female interest compared to jaclyn smith in the tv version again the tv movie was a better translation of the booksuggest get your hands on the tv movie first and then watch damons bourne you will know what i mean,intelligence
it seems that so many people i talk to either completely love this movie or just hate everything about it lets look at the facts spoilers matt damon does not shoot his target due to some children being in the way probably not too believable but otherwise his acting is actually about on par with his performance in good will hunting he has the role of jason bourne down franka potente is excellent as the bewildered german who gets involved in all of this the parts of the fellow assassins were completely believable as well as those who work for the cia the plot takes several twists but they are interesting and add a good dynamic to the film the cinemetography is fab as are the locations there are also some great action scenes ala the car chase in a mini flying down the steps back to the original argument i do not know why there is such a love hate relationship with this movie but i cant really find much wrong with it at all if you are one of those people voting low for this flick do yourself a favor and watch it again its pretty damn fab 810,intelligence
i like a movie that tries to be faithful to the writers story this was nothing at all like the robert ludlum book matt damon while doing a fairly decent acting job is at least 15 years younger than the character in the book and to be as good an assassin as his character would require greater age  experience the original movie with richard chamberlain  jaclyn smith was far better but if all you look for in a movie is killing and car chases then this is a movie for you 110 for book accuracy 710 for action,intelligence
this was a great movie it was not by any means predictable and it had a cast of very talented actors one thing i did hear tho was that this movie was the first of a trilogy and was wondering if it was true movies of this nature it is always great to have more matt damon is hott and a great actor,intelligence
i havent read the book so i cant comment on the faithfulness of the film as an adaptation but standing alone i thought it a very  impressive espionage thriller damon with his chicklet like capped teeth was very believable as bourne and the rest of the cast was more than competent the stunts and martial arts choreography were very exciting and exhilarating and were executed no pun intended most impressively i look forward to further installments in the franchise recommended 810,intelligence
one of those films that really dont improve too much on the trailer that advertised it but its a better than average spy pic taken from the ludlum novel which i never read but something tells me wasnt much like this film damon is convincing as the beleaguered amnesiac bourne and franka as always loveable playing here a euro trash drifterlove interest high tech gizmos galore and lots of those impressive movie cia cant miss assassins true to life hmmmm arent there 2 notorious targets running around in iraq and afghanistan that we supposedly have marked for dead maybe hollywood should send some men out there the real cia cant seem to do the job but if you can suspend disbelief and ignore the evil american empire nonsense this movie is aok excellent scenery,intelligence
bourne identity is a movie about a dangerous assassin who has lost his memory and gradually recovers one of the interesting parts is the way he gets his memory back its not like were used to in most of the films ie images from the past coming back but by coming to realize  his abilities like fighting skills etc another part that makes this movie very nice to watch is that its located in europe which gives it another air than were used to in hollywood movies i personally like this atmosphere very much like in ronin i also found franka potente a very pleasant surprise i havent seen lola runs yet but i definitely plan to now some might say that all in all its just an adventure movie perhaps better than the usual ones but i definitely think its more than that,intelligence
as is obvious with any thriller you need to leave your analytical mind aside while watching this movie not that its specifically too far out but its best enjoyed for what it is an entertaining thrillerin fact some things feel quite realistic in the movie for instance matt damons character isnt unidimensional and rings quite true for what hes supposed to be that part was quite refreshingthe plot is perhaps not as complex as one might expect from a movie based on a novel we learn most of what we need pretty early on but it works out right in terms of tension and directionsimilarities with no way out starring kevin costner have to do mostly with this type of tension and the type of bad guys found in both moviesan interesting thing about the movie is that some of the ancillary characters such as the fishermen at the beginning are portrayed in a somewhat subtle light for such a manichean plot,intelligence
great adaptation of the robert ludlum classic about a man who does not know who he is and is hunted by people who wants him dead matt damon is great as jason bourne  a man who has to stay one step a head of his would be assassins and chris cooper is also great as the man who wants him dead this is the first of the jason bourne series and judging by how well they did this film i have high hopes for the second,intelligence
i am not a big fan of actionadventure films but this film had a good plot and everything was quite perfect but some parts were boring and was dragging a little my favorite character is probably marie played by potente because she helped bourne a lot and stayed with him and supported him i liked that there was a little romance in it too i would see the sequel when it comes out  out of ,intelligence
i see many people are greatly offended by s deviation from the book ive not read the book but i can tell you i really enjoyed this moviematt damon proved very beleivable as a highly trained cia assassin franka potente was good though not quite up to damons performance here excellent supporting roles by chris cooper and brian cox believable chase scenes minus something blowing up every 10 seconds thank god if you enjoy action flicks this one will keep you in your seat i give it a solid 810,intelligence
i watched this movie for franka potente and i was rather disappointed with her performance i thought she was quite bland i never cared much for matt damon but i thought chris cooper was very good a decent time waster but no more i certainly hope that the sequel is better and i also hope that franka potente appears in it and gives a better performance 610,intelligence
represents the latest butchering of a novel by taking some absolutely absurd liberties  first off matt damon is terrible as jason bourne  his credibility is on par with miss piggyaside from the atrocious script the film also flunks because of poor editing and camera work  while it is not exaggerated in the mtv style of film can simply be renamed the bored identity because of the poor pacing and failure to create any suspense  i dont know where hollywood is hiring these new crew from but ability is not one of their strong suits  this probably has verna fields rolling in her gravemarginal realism is something that robert ludlum attempted to create when he wrote the novel  being the enormous fan of the books that i am i was not impressed by the studios attempts to modernize the storyoverall not worth your time  the day of the jackal and north by northwest are superior to this uninspired and slow tub of lard  15 out of 5 stars,intelligence
i enjoyed rather more than i expected reviews in the uk had been generally positive but i expected something pretty formulaic and predictablewhat made the film was the eccentric casting and clever direction casting director joseph middleton must have had a brief to undermine expectations in the casting of the female lead as run lola runs franke potente is a very un holywood choice she convinces me rather more than matt damon as bournewhich is odd because the part should suit the robotic style of acting he favours perhaps the problem is that he wasnt believable when struggling to assert the human being over the programmed killing machine as he struggled to remember who he was what was funny was glamour girl julia stiles relegated to the second division role as agent controller in a dingy hotel room surrounded by monitors didnt the producers think to switch around their female leads to improve the audience demographic or is there the delicious possibility thatthey were duped into approving the casting without realizing which actress had the lead role good support from chris cooper a dependable brian cox anear silent clive owen and nice to see walt goggins from the shield in a small roleon the direction front i was surprised by how confident doug liman was withthe action sequences these could have been terribly predictable or derivative but instead he showed real flair  a great paris car chase led by a battered mini some vicious handtohand fighting  and he handled the pleasing europeanlocations with flair it had a similar feel to luc bessons underrated thetransporterso in summary this is aboveaverage fare,intelligence
personally i find it almost insulting that someone with 2 bullets in their back recovers so quickly  it turned me off almost immediately toward the film to see bullets plucked like zits and within 2 weeks the man up doing pullups without difficulty tearing scar tissue bleeding from wounds etcother points in the movie were all right but the landlord in paris didnt need a spot between her eyes  our embassy in switzerland didnt seem to have their wits about themself eitherall in all i guess disappointing was the best comment  i really liked the amateur it was well done and the basics were here in this material to do at least the same quality if not better  is this what agent style movie making has come to  why cant someone make an agent movie with a character like secret agent where the star concentrates more on surviving and not some wench,intelligence
im not really sure why this movie was called maybe youre trying to cash in on the success of the novels but anyone whos actually read them myself included is pretty horrified that they thought the movie was going to be anything like the book plot is 95 different similarity guy with gets amensia almost drowns meets girls thinks hes an assassin the movie with goldie hawn could almost have been titled characters are almost all different plot was pretty stupid too and script even mocks ludlum complex plot intrigues when bourne goes to the hotel for the receipt very strange and irritating to watch grade d,intelligence
is one of the best action thriller popcorn whatever moves ifve seen in a long long time it is such a fun to watch it has everything martial arts and car chase hundred times better than in the matrix reloaded cool chick that could actually act and most important of all it had that feeling of realism yea thats right realism something unusual for such moviesmatt damon is an amnesiac who happens to be one of cias top assassins till he figures that out he has to deal with a whole bunch of people who want him down virtually everybody in this movie tries to kill him but thats ok for as i sad the film is still realistic as a film can be matt damon contributes a lot to that feeling solid performance i especially liked the scene at the american embassy when he came down from the roof like alpinist no music just him and the wall it might sound crazy but i liked itthe whole movie basically is about nothing has no heroes and no bad guys it goes nowhere it wontmakeyouthink kind of movie pure entertainment everythings executed at a very good pace with some great camera work and surprisingly good performance from matt i didnft like him very much even in good will hunting highly recommended,intelligence
with matt damon wasnt nearly as good as i thought it would be it was clunky and didnt fit well together parts were kinda cool but this just didnt work i wouldnt recommend this but some people might like thismaybe looked cool in the preview but all the best parts were in the preview not recommended go with a jackie chan movie much more funwhat 73 cpg13 for violent sequences and some profantity,intelligence
action movie without incredible explosions accompanying every car chase or whatever nicely done i hope to see more of this type of movie the reason it didnt get a higher mark was probably because i didnt think it was anything absolutely exceptional it was entertaining to watch but it didnt have anything really grabbing,intelligence
as a great ludlum fan i watched this movie after reading the book something that turned out to be the wrong way to go but still the movie in it self is a pretty good one i really like the realism in the chase and fighting scenes i like the colours and of course i like the wonderful settings around euorpeto bad though that there was no carlos the jackal in the story the real plot has more dept and is more complex but as always the movie fail to live up to it if you havent read the book yet  do it,intelligence

i dont think i have ever felt more conflicted about a movie than i did about this one tony gilroys script absolutely mutilates the source material robert ludlums gripping intricately woven novel the simplified dumbeddown version of the story seen here is down right painful to those who know the real story the change to the central premise of jason bournes identity is roughly equivalent to remaking citizen kane and saying rosebud is    a flower    or something okay the book isnt as good as citizen kane but its the best analogy i can think ofthat said had i seen this film without ever having read the book or seen the emmy nominated mini series which may be a little hokey put retains far more of the intelligence of the plot i have no doubt i would have quite liked this film its a good little thriller matt damon one of the most talented of the current crop of overexposed young actors surprises again by making a credible action hero as does director doug liman who would have thought the swingers guy could do actionsuspenceif you arent familiar with the real story see this movie first and youll enjoy it if you have seen this movie but not read the book read it and youll understand what we ludlum fans are complaining about,intelligence

i havent read the book so my views only reflect the impression that this movie gives me and does not focus on whether it is loyal to the original novel or notthe film has that air or arrogance if you like of a classy thriller the music brings out a kind of good old espionage atmosphere  unlike the style of other recent spy movies which focus on gadgets and dazzling the audience with hitech there is still showing off hitech in this film but it doesnt go so far as to degrading the film because the attention is mainly on telling the story rather than building up to one action showdown after anotherand the story without having read the book looks pretty good to me its good enough for the film to last two hours without getting the audience bored the action scenes are good enough and has a different touch to it rather than imitating the matrix like so many other movies have anyway to wrap this comment up i say if you are a keen thriller fan and havent seen this film you should see it at least once,intelligence
to me the movie was the disappointment of the year for those who expect a movie truly based on the ludlum novel dont there is no remembering how to disassemble a weapon no talking in asian toungues no carlos the jackal none theres the amnesia a girl named marie and matt damon who though performing well in no way answers to the image of jason bourne the way ludlum describes him and thats as far as it goes for following the original story linethe cast is without exception doing its damnest to make something of a script that should have died where the movie starts sinking away to the bottom of the ocean,intelligence

i really like the fight scenes with matt damon he shows some really cool moves as a trained assassin  the story was ok but it does drag in parts and i really didnt like the lead actress i dont think she and damon had much chemistry and they didnt do a lot together so i didnt buy them falling in love on their short adventure together  the car chase scene was ok but there just wasnt anything special about it plus we knew damon would get away at the end since it was in the middle of the movie  of course it does have some things that dont make sense like why bother trying to kill jason borne if he has no memory of what he did  and then they let him go in the end why not finish the job  plus what was going on at the cia never made much sensefinal verdict  the best part of this movie is the hot matt damon too bad he didnt have several scenes with no shirt  there are some cool hand to hand combat scenes but the whole story seemed more like a made for tv movie i dont know how it could have cost 75 million to make  i recommend it if you like spy movies or matt damon but if you like really fast paced movies then you may want to skip this,intelligence
i thought franka was a bad choice as the love interest i didnt  think she was believable opposite matt damon  she is not a very good actress at least not in this movie also she is in my opinion completely unattractive sorry franka  the movie was a little slow and matt and franka just didnt click,intelligence

finally caught up with tonight  a movie i had somehow missed  despite hitting the cinema like once or twice a week year in year out  and had definitely wanted to see in the first place to bootwell in the end it turned out i had not missed all that much the movie does fine in the sheer craft department being edited well suitably convincing in appearances scenery gadgets and secondary castyet it is also as uninnovative as they come has less surprising plottwists than your average disney cartoon and a hero matt damon which one finds it hard to sympathize with at all there is not all that much action it takes like 30 minutes before the audience gets any sizable fightchase  and when it takes place it looks harmless artificial and strangely unsanguine for some reason there is very little blood at all in the movie even when some guy is shot with a shotgun twice and is then shown in several closeup shots no real kicks for the viewer here  while i am not a gore hound i found it taking the urgency out of the fights regretably the bad guys are of the utterly uninteresting sort as well  soulless onedimensional killers arrogant and conceited secretservice bureaucrats and some shadowy political backers nothing new nothing memorable  everything is conventional foolproof and has  one begins to feel with regret  been seen a thousand times before  especially the paris scenes why oh why does every europebased thrillerspy movie coming out of hollywood these days have to take place in paris  dear directors please take the hint  this  makes for an inevitable comparison between masterworks or scenes at least done very well with mediocre and soulless ones   which may be yours  this severely hurts  there already are several much better memorable car chases through paris eg ronin kiss of the dragon etc  and there have been more breathtaking furious fights in paris houses and staircases too  the pont noeuf or 19th century french townhouses are not new innovative location and neither are the quais on the banks of the seine with notre dame in the background been there seen that a thousand times the fight scenes and matt damons sparring especially are unremarkable  an utterly  bad thing for the main protagonist in an action movie  if we cannot root for him or at least marvel at his prowess  who else should catch our interest  why even tell his story  his acting is defintely not going to draw us in  he walks about like some wounded puppy only to turn into a rabid rottweiler in the fight scenes and back again like a light switch thrown really deep acting there makes it hard to sympathize with him  especially as to the audience it is quite  obvious what he is right from the start while mr bourne seems to need ages to realize what sort of life and profession he has forgotten due to the old trusty plotsaving device of amnesia yawn  this and the movies dominant moody blueish light but this too has been done much more effectively before  makes for a very cool frigid and emotionally detached athmosphere  not bad in a spy thriller but a weakness if you already have to struggle for the audiences interest due to a witless plot lets not forget the rather weak soundtrack which if used properly might have lent some urgency or drama to the story again a failure also bourne is as free of humour as it is bloodless  total really chilling   so chilling in fact that any attempts at characterforming acting by matt damon and franka potente must find it impossible to involve the audience  because the audience cannot help but not to care for mr bourne mrs potente btw is hopelessly overqualified for her roles acting requirements  which makes matt damons lightswitch acting seem even more wooden and threadbareas a resumee  uninspired fights and chases weak and obvious plot uninteresting onedimensional characters no humour but at least well done handiwork on the camera and in editingwell lets hope there is no sequel to squander money on,intelligence
this is a wellmade wellacted film with plenty of action  however what it lacks is any suspenseevery time bourne is up against some sort of obstacle human or otherwise he and we discovers that he just happens to have the skill he needs to effortlessly succeed  we watch a james bond movie and know he will come out on top but that is less frustrating because 1 over many films we have grown familiar with his list of skills and 2 we arent expected to take it seriously anyways  i wanted bourne to just once stumble across his own personal kryptonite or crazed industrialist with a laser,intelligence
although this movie doesnt rock your world in terms of originality it has great action sequences i think he kicks faster than neo a mustwatch is the carchase which is one of the best i have ever seen the power of the movie is certainly partly due to the soundtrack i can recommend to anyone who likes a james bond style movie,intelligence
please watch this movie before reading the book or you will be sorely disappointed  the action sequences of the movie were excellent and if you are a fan of movies featuring matt damon with special powers you will enjoy the movie  however there are several elements of the plot which simply do not make sense  after reading the book which was written in the late 70s it is clear that the producers of the movie attempted to modernize the plot with tragic consequences especially involving character development or the lack thereof,intelligence
this was a real disappointment ive neither seen the book or the earlier tv miniseries  but although the acting direction and scenery are nice  the plot is shot through with holes about fifteen times i found myself angry that bourne does something that no one would do  and so many small things didnt make sense it also feels quite dated  in these times when most americans hope that the cia has plenty of assassins not just drones to destroy our enemiesthis is really bad  hokey unattractive female lead so many things that cause you to doubt bournes intelligence if youre in the mood for a good movie of this kind set in europe  see ronin  its much better,intelligence
robert ludlum is one of my favorite spy stories writer many of his books deal with the issues of memory and describe common people accidentally caught in spy intrigues webs is the case of such a lost memory case  with the main hero suffering of amnesia and learning fast that his true identity may be one he prefers to keep forgottenunfortunately the complexity of the ludlum action is badly brought to screen in this film we never get a good explanation of what really was behind the complex and seemingly all powerful spy organization that tries to eliminate our hero the action is paced there are many good atmosphere scenes a plausible romantic thread but the logic is missing and many viewers may be in the situation of not really being able to describe what the film was about after having seen it still good entertainment  710 on my personal scale action and spy movie fans will not be disappointed after all,intelligence
if you read the book this version is just ridiculous this is also in my opinion on of the worst adaption ive ever have seen what a difference to the tvversion starring richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith almost true after the ludlumbook where was carlosand damon as the action hero looks like a college boy what a misscasting,intelligence
years ago i saw the 80s tvadaptation of ludlums great book which i read by chance some years after i liked the film as far as i remember i loved the book and now im sort of slightly disappointedright bourne 2002 is a solid action movie with a catching car hunt through paris nice fighting scenes and some actors i always enjoy to see on screen franka and matt make a matching couple just look at their profiles but  and thats rather a but  during the whole film i was kind of puzzledfirst puzzler the zurich shots were definitely not made in zurich i think i know this town quite well but where the heck should this have been filmed it looks kinda like it but it sure is not whereas in the 80s version you could tell it was ok being swiss i may be a little too sensitive about that  second puzzler how did jason bourne make it to switzerland in the first place  on a train without any document of identification they do control at the swiss border you know  third puzzler what about bournes and the professors headache why mention it anyway if theres no real point to it in the whole storyline  forth puzzler what is treadstone about anyway and dont expect me to read the book again to answer that if i spend money for a dvd i might as well expect some conclusion herei might add some more but my comment already sounds far more negative than i intended it to be in the first place so lets bring this to a nice hollywoodlike ending as in the movie sit back relax enjoy the show and ignore the inconsistencies and loose ends under these aspects i give it a 710  but i still like the 80s version better,intelligence
from the very beginning this movie was missing something realintrigue genuine caring for the protagonist i think all the cia stuffclues you in too much to figuring out who he is way too early in themovie so it ends up being not very suspenseful franka potentescharacter was kinda flat she and bourne didnt really have thatmuch chemistry just the obligatory boyintroublemeetsgirl andas small as julia stiles part was she was still bad its bourneisnt it or whatever she said when the lights went out ugh as forthe amnesia if bourne could remember lots of other innate stufflike languages and fighting skills isnt it likely he would have hadan immediate answer to the question what kind of music do youlike and how by the way did this movie get a pg13 there wasplenty of violence and several dead bodies,intelligence
finally a top espionage thriller that i and my wife liked very much it begins mysterious powerful and ends with a happyend the story keeps you guessing like a puzzle and there were many plots and twists all is well mixed with action adventure and suspense congratulations to the director doug liman and of course to the actors matt damon and franka potente who delivered a strong performance this movie is a perfect example for all directors and writers how the audience should be entertained in futurei liked the car chase and of course the setting in paris interesting how the city of zurich is transformed in prag where the bank scenes have been turned the painted blue white trams that are the colors of this swiss city were nice to see in the movie i highly recommend it to every thriller fan if you liked this one dont miss frantic with harrison ford  7510,intelligence
entertaining from start to finish nothing real deep but a good watch a bit of a new role for damon but he pulls it off well i wouldnt be surprised if he did a few more like this  i bought it on dvd prev viewed for about 14 and figure i got my moneys worth,intelligence
watching this ludlum results in how obvious questions questions questions yearning to be answered dont expect a good action movie i mean if you want that  go watch yetanother schwarzenegger this is supposed to be a mystery thats quite what it is leaves a lot of puzzles unsolved at the end and the still andor stepbystep function of your dvd player wont help you  rather disappoint youive found this movie very entertaining so did my girlfriend according to her matt damon has never been sexier i mean who am i to disagree i was charmed by the fact that this was shot in europe europe looks prettier than ever  paris is beautiful matts dutch is excellent so is his german and the car chase through the streets of paris is an amazing piece of set workchris cooper is excellent he deserves another oscar for this work always very much american vulnerable straightforward subtle  natural acting  makes him a reason alone to watch this movienot an artistic masterpiece just one of those good old fashioned european spy movies if youre into that go see it you wont be disappointed,intelligence
it wasnt until about 20 minutes into the film that i realised id watched it or part of it before this suggests that the first time i watched it i was very very drunk despite the feeling that you think you may need to concentrate to get the best out of the film its very easy to watch and doesnt tax the mind too much all is explained as the plot unwinds though matt damons ability for dealing with all the obstacles put in his way are sometimes a bit unbelievable unless you imagine arnie in the role in fact its a pity for arnie that he didnt do this film we might have seen him in something good for a change worth watching even for a second time,intelligence
i had read the book before having seen the movie i loved the book it is an incredible piece of writing that i somehow still remember which is why when i saw the movie i had no idea what was going on the movie doesnt even come close to the book everything that jason bourne ever wanted to know all of the questions he kept asking himself all of the answers he went look for are in the end of the book they dont even make it into the movie up until the scene in bournes apartment i almost believed that they could cram a long novel into 2 hours from there i dont know where to beginmatt damon is not suitable for spy thrillers jason bourne is supposed to be a sophisticated man who could blend into any background become invisible damon can do none of that he can barely act the rest of the cast was good though julia stiles as nicole was somewhat unneccessary though when she first came on screen i looked at her for a second and knew that she was julia stiles no amount of make up or acting can hide thatcain is for charlie delta is for cain now where the hell is carlos,intelligence
for what it was was a good movie  action movies in general have many flaws  this one does too  but if an action movie is as well made as this one is then we or at least i generally overlook them i am not a really big fan of damon but he was good in this flick  the twist at the end was totally surprising to me  overall it was a good movie,intelligence
is an extremely good movie and i would recommend this film to anyone who has read the book or seen the original movie  matt damon is the perfect part for this movie and franka potente was also a good choice after run lola run  a must for all lovers of spy movies,intelligence
it has been a while ago that a good thriller like this one was made action suspense and good acting damon action hero to be made me want to see this dvd again and again hope they are going to make more movies like this one,intelligence
i like matt damon and i like the older james bondmovies  i liked the director understood that in suspense thrillers less is more and didnt go for no triple xbullst but instead set some nice little action scenes like the escape from embassy and oh the catnmouse with the sniper in the field  straight out of some 70s spy movie i could almost imagine the same situation played with say gene hackman or michael caine great stuff minimal yet effective the final shootout was one click too close to ridicule hope they would have tuned it down that much you now what part i mean and added in say 23 more bad guys but thats just me bitching also nothing wrong with the carwrecking action just that after ronin however the two real downsides of the movie are 1 the headquarterstuff was straight out of a bad bmoviewhats the french word for stakeout aw cmon please weve seen that ped of captainact in a hundred buddycop actioners one might think chris cooper is a bad actor if he wouldnt have just received an oscar and if one hadnt seen american beauty 2 why is wombosi portrayed in a wideeyed comicbook style seriously out of stylebut as a whole this flick is well worthy of purchase,intelligence
this film is one of the best spy actioners of recent times it ranks way better than any of the previous bond films of the last ten if not twenty years i very much look forward to the next instillation of this series matt damon is just right and the female lead does a great job that is franka potente she is great because she has a natural feel to her someone like julia roberts would have been totally wrong and would have ruined it potente gives the role that european touch that only a euro actor could give to it three cheers to european actors anyway i was suprised how much i liked the film check it out,intelligence
mr bourne is highly trained agent suffering from amnesia trying to find out about his past but everybody wants to kill him is the coolest agentspy movie ever james bond was a py this is like mies vailla menneisyytta man without a past with some attitude,intelligence
a little far fetched but mostly in the way they give a euro mini about 300 horsepower and the shocks of a humv  aside from that and the plot holes it was a solid across the board 8 film  you can tell they edited it for a pg13 rating just like they do for all the bond movies  boy it sounds like i didnt enjoy this film but really i did  check the stats on imdb  every sexage bracket gave this film at least a 7  pretty rare for any film worth having in my collection,intelligence
spoilerssure he acts like an unhuman robot at times but theres several scenes in the movie that make it seem he used to be a nice guy  an average joe framke is her own stunning self  shes always this way  though she definately has done better movies in germany  lola rennt comes to mind run lola run  this is the third movie of hers ive seen and the first one shes done in english  though the title song for lola rennt was done in englishmatt damon continues to beat ben affleck into a bloody pulp  no matter how you cut it hes the better actorthere are some storyline gaps maybe the movie was running faster that it should havebut its a pretty good movie  maybe i should check out the tv version now its also on dvd810quality 710 entertainment 1010 replayable 1010,intelligence
certainly bourne identity had a slightlyinteresting premise  however the execution was botched and rendered the film less appealing than it could have beenthe photography was universally bland and boring except for the action scenes  during the action scenes the photography was downright bad  the camera edits were confusing and changed perspective so frequently that the important scenes came off as unfinished and choppy it was also quite evident that matt damon didnt really know much about what he was doing as evinced by the camera shifting angles at key points of contactin addition to the blas cinematography the film had all the key elements of cheesiness that are so prevalent in modern cinema  cars still do not explode when shot with a shotgun when will hollywood take physics 101 and learn this  there were a plethora of completely unbelievable scenes that were clearly only for the purpose of eye candy and were designed specifically for the teenage machismo crowdthe subplot notice the singular was hobbledtogether and contrived as if it were placed at the last minute  several events were just too convenient  but then again this is hollywood of which i speaki dont know why this film has such a high rating  im glad i didnt pay to see it in theaters or rent it  there was nothing redemptive to make this production stand out from the generouslyproportioned crowd of which it is part,intelligence
2002 d doug liman matt damon franka potente chris cooper clive owen brian cox julia stiles gabriel mann walt goggins entertaining action farce has every action clich imaginable but a good performance by damon makes it worthwhile a man washes ashore ridden with amnesia and bulletholes as he tries to piece his life back together and eventually gets involved in international espionage nothing special rating 6 out of 10 rated pg13 for violence and profanity,intelligence
im not hard to surprise when it comes to movies  i didnt guess the ending of the sixth sense i had no idea who keyser soze was and i didnt predict the twist in primal fear  but with it was perfectly obvious exactly who jason bourne worked for in the first five minutes and in the first ten minutes it was clear what his job was  i simply cant understand how people could call it suspenseful much less confusing frankly i dont think director doug liman meant to keep anything about bourne secret from the audience  and that is stupid because whatever potential the movie had to generate tension and suspense depended on us being as clueless as jason bourne as to who he wascompare this movie to the matrix  the matrix is a pretty secondrate movie too but its good for its first half for one reason we know no more than neo does  he doesnt know who morpheus and trinity are or what theyre up to and neither do we  the brief glimpse we got of trinity just deepened the mystery  in there is no mystery for us to penetrate were just waiting for bourne to catch up to where we already are which is simply an exercise in tedium  this is aggravated by the fact that bourne is pretty slow on the uptake  by the time he got out of the zurich bank he should have realized that there were only two possibilities for what he was intelligence agent and professional criminal  the audience of course doesnt even have that much uncertainty since we are shown bournes employers early onvery little thought went into this movie  for instance when bourne discovers his pile of passports each with a different identity attached he should have had no way of determining which one was actually him since he had no memory  but he just guesses right miraculously  the swiss police are shown as being unaware that a us embassy not present in zurich anyway is sovereign us territory  the marines guarding the embassy are shown as being unarmed until they get into the arsenal ive never been to the swiss embassy but in nicaragua the marines carried their m16 rifles in the very door of the embassy and even in the consulatesthe best i can say about franka potente is that she managed at times to distract me from the fact that she adds nothing to the story  this movie should have been entirely bournes show and shes there just to provide a love interest and to be a springboard for dialogue because liman is too lazy to provide exposition with just bourne himself  julia stiles is window dressing the director obviously hasnt the foggiest idea what to do with his female actorsanyway isnt a complete disaster it gets markedly better in the second half its no more credible than before but at least the stupidities like bournes escape scene have a payoff in thrills  the acting is good by everybody  take a note of the small touches when agbaje enters the morgue his nostrils quiver as the smell hits him and when stiles hands over the information to the assassin you can detect her fear of him even though he is on her side  and it has a superior car chase scene  the acting by everybody is goodoverall the movie is tolerable but the premise could have delivered a much better filmrating  out of recommendation  action fans should catch it on tv,intelligence
first im not a movie critic and i dont pretend to write like one awesome stunt riders on the police kbikes riding those at speed on wet cobblestones takes a lot of skill would like to see a race between this mini and steve mcqueens bullitt mustang someday okay ill shut up about the chase scene now the rest was pretty good too if you want the intellectual read on this check out somebody elses comments,intelligence
do you remember being a child and playing with your friends and then you will come up with the desperate idea of making one of the toys fly to by ahead of the game by saying this gi joe is flyiiing  and then when your chums will disagree with you the reaction is even more desperate yes it can fly look it has wings or whateverthis is exactly what you will see in this movie one desperate attempt after another for stuffing the movie into the moneymaking frame in which you are not supposed to ask how that could happened why should i believe this and  i better put my brain in idle an let hollywood teach me what a real hero is for just 10 the ticketyou will love the feast of clichs so much that you will feel disgusted that in 2003 you are still getting entertained for such flat and idiotic films  the romance in moments of rush the cia big flat screens on the wall little texts telling you where things are happening the whole nine yardsthe acting well you dont have to put a lot of effort into portraying a young man returning from severe amnesia and 2 bullet wounds like is recovering from a binge with the frat brothers the night before  also this hero doesnt have to worry about anything he gets money out of nowhere meets a beautiful lady as sidekick with a perfect car for the chasing scenes in paris streets when is time to flee  has forgotten everything but knowing how to kill with a bic pen exactly when the bad guys want to eliminate him  yes he is an assessing with a lot of good luckis an action movie with unoriginal action is a thriller without suspense and it is a romance without randomness,intelligence
matt damon is in excellent condition while passing himself off as a spy in  outstanding in its combat scenes and clandestine action sequences this film has one problem  it resembles the feeling you get when you put together a jigsaw puzzle  thats not a bad thing however once youve done the hard work in putting it together it doesnt quite look like it lives up to all the hard work thats been put into it its final resolution comes off as thin quickly put together in its writing and the dvd features an alternative last scene ending that has more feeling and speaks to the audience without words  a minor league james bond at best but still worth a look,intelligence
i really enjoyed this show no problem dealing with any plausibility issues regarding bourne his id his skills as an agent or plot people must learn to lighten up and stop dissecting everything to deathlife for these and those of their ilk must be no fun at allkarl so take your lab coats off  and quit complaining bob,intelligence
a question i must answer every single day of my life is the most fundamental of all  who am i  am i the product of my environment whether good or bad  am i defined by what i do  am i synonymous with my job  is my personality my very sense of self gods own caricature written long ago in the stars and etched in the palm of my hands  or do i have the willpower to choose who i am  can i say who i am without reference to my past or my occupation  matt damons character jason bourne is a man who is faced with exactly this challenge which is what makes inherently compelling  while watching jasons attempt to discover himself to find out who he is i sit and share his inner trepidation for one reason  when he discovers his social identity will it be compatible with his natural instinctive self the self that has come to him from a near death experience like a second birth  or will he find out that hes gone off the rails somewhere along the way  will he find out that the choices hes made the life and occupation hes chosen for himself is in alignment with his uncluttered self  i identify with the main character because im forced to ask myself the same questions  is all this stuff i use to describe myself my personal history my talents who i really am  does my personal history really reflect my deepest values  am i living an authentic life this is interesting stuff a compelling reification of socratess idea of learning as recollection  the main character discovers as does the audience that his past life is an identity a cover story and not the true jason bourne  its as if hes playing whats my line and hes all three contestants  in this film bourne is a hero of selfdiscovery and not some idiotic james bond type who cant distinguish his penis from his gun,intelligence
in some cases the film is better than the book but this isnt one of them this isnt a bad film its just that the book is much better mainly due to details the film lacks many of the small details that ludlum so carefully adds to his writing what this film has is an excellent cast matt damon chris cooper brian cox and usunknown franka potente these folks all do a creditable job in this film and the basic story is a strong one but it just lacks so many details that jasons story is never told in any depthof course in a way thats the premise of the film still the film is only a shell of the book ludlum writes a lot of detail into his books and thats what makes them so interesting i might watch this film again but i wont hurry to do so,intelligence
hey does anyone know who the artist is and the song title that was used in the alternate ending of the dvdfwiw ive read the book and watched the movie now  i kinda liked how the story was a lot tighter in the movie  the book had some more suspense in parts but dragged early on and the ending was less than satisfactory as well imo,intelligence
i am a matt damon fan here in his home state of massachusetts i just bought a hitachi dvd player and have purchased rounders and oceans 11 which i enjoyed i got bourne identity as a gift but was very much let down by it female lead the german chick seems like a nice person based on interviews in bonus coverage but she was a definite miscast for this role in all the dvd bonus coverages i have seen the directors always say how important casting is this is where bourne fell apart a bombshell with some charisma opposite damon would have made this much better in this film the german girl sports a hideous tatoo on her back and you actually hope she keeps her clothes on also i couldnt understand a word the african guy was saying like i said i wish i could forget watching this but at least it was better than watching celtics play raptors 6 out of 10dont buy,intelligence
im one of those lucky ones who dont read the book before i see the film so i can take it on its own merits i found it to be very good and better than such recent high profile thrillers as minority report and the like matt damon is good as the secret agent found floating in the mediterranian sea south of marseilles and picked up for dead by fishermen poor guy couldnt remember anything about who he was but quickly figured out he must have had lots of training because his awareness and defense skills were second to nonespoilers  read further at your own riskas everything unfolds we find out he was a highly trained assassin with a place in paris and many different passports under many names he had been sent by a highly covert operation to snuff an exiled former african leader who was threatening to expose things if he were not reinstated but an assassin with a conscience is a handicap and when he saw the children with his target could not do it and instead was shot and dumped so the whole film is his trying to find out who he really is while his covert organization thinks he has snapped so are trying to kill him but he is too good he always gets the upper hand and there is a great chase scene through the streets of paris him driving a red mini police chasing in cars and on motorcycles with marie franka potente at his side about halfway into the film they are alone she begins to kiss him and in his memory loss had a moment to try and figure out if he liked girls he figured it outin the end he is presumed dead the covert operation disbanded marie ends up with a cafe and motorbike rental on a small greek island and he finds her good movie good ending i suppose the reason i liked it so much is the way we pull for the underdog here both bourne and marie who only want to have a safe normal life the dvd picture is excellent and the surround sound is very dynamic and aggressive very high entertainment valuesept 2017 edit just watched it again still a nicely entertaining movie,intelligence
i rented this movie expecting to not like it  i love ludlum books but find that they are almost impossible to screenplay effectivelyi was very happy with the overall feel and pacing of the movie  i also missed the opening credits so i was unaware until the end that doug liman had directed  swingers is one of my faves and i also enjoyed go so upon learning he directed it my happiness with the movie was reinforcedoverall a well done spy flick without all the bondesque glam but with all the action you should expect  the use of franka absolutely sold me on this movieone question was damons dialogue with her in the car the part where he says something like youve got to be able to run an intentional wink to run lola run,intelligence
what can i say after seeing this movie i now want to buy a mini  they must be besides from the bmw the best to whip the pants off of any cop car it happened in the michael caine film the italian job and now thisanyway bourne identity is a remake from an 80s tv show and apparently a perversion from the book i dont know havent read it  while having lots of action and chasing the film wasnt as nail biting as i think the people involved making it wanted it to be i myself  who hates anyone chit chatting through a film  was beginning to wonder from the screen and making idle conversation with my misses  then going back to the film and still having a grasp on what was going on not a good signif you like action rent it if not then wait for cable,intelligence
if i could truthfully say robert ludlum would be proud i would be lying to a extent with many holes including the fact that marie is actullay a accountant which is methodical instead of a gypsy that jason and marie form a bond as she was rudly raped the fact that her brother was killed is no biggie no not at all but i did enjoy it they had a very intense view if i never read the book i wouldnt know and be on the same page as jason wondering who the hell is this strange man running for his life i like the way they kept it a brainy novel to the hotel bank mourge all the same indeed they had to modernize it for anyone who read the novel there was no laser it was a micro filment that can only be seen with a rusty projector the doctors name was all wrong geoffry washburn to groncial something like that is totally wrong what about wiring the good doctor his 1 million dollars so many things left out things that matter marie and jason never ever leave each other in the book jason kidnaps marie she isnt offered money just if she helps him she keeps her life overall the closeness to the book and the authors wishes a very very low 2 but excitement 9 genre 10 sosawthatcoming 5 total 65 ive seen better maybe another one the bourne supremacy will get a higher score,intelligence
i really had so much fun watching but mind its not a classic but well worth watching thought its abit daft when mr bourne was floting in the sea at the start of the film in real life we would of been dead in that time of season good acting had a good story nice plot to the film and cant forget the mini car chase in paris and the music to it just so cool i am giving this film 710,intelligence
the bourne identedy stars matt damon in his action hero debeut as a highly skilled assassin recovering from amnesia once he finds out jason bourne sets out to find the reason he was suppose to be dead he notices his terrific skills for combat and understandment of all around him this movie impressed me with the action scenes i mean really when was the last time you saw a top agent ride a dead guy down a staircase gap to kill someone scenes like that will blow you away just like when youll see a great car chase through traffic this movie has my honours of 810,intelligence
there are definately a lot of robert ludlam fans that saw this movie and most likely all are dissapointed  my roommate read the booksaw the movie and complained i hadnt read the book and thus enjoyed the movie as someone with no prior knowledge of the bourne series of books  this movie was very well done with some pretty stylish elements ive enjoyed director doug limans past two films siwngers and go  the action was very entertaining believeable and well distributed throughout the film matt damon did a good job in this role and was a true badass yet confused assasin  i especially liked the scene between him and the assasin trying to kill him in the field though i wont say more about it and spoil the movie for anyone who hasnt seen it i cant see much wrong with this movie and it one of the better films i saw in the theaters last year,intelligence
well aside from all of the death defying chases on foot and in cars this movie to be perfectly honest was rather bland it didnt really hold my attention long enough to keep me from doing other things while watching itmy short attention span aside i think franka potente did a good job acting as sort of a drifter who gets unexpectedly caught up with damon a trained assasin with amnesia and i especially liked the fast cuts during all of the fight scenes which represented his mastery of hand to hand combat but all in all i couldnt help comparing it to the likes of so many other movies that share the same plot linesso if you love trying to decipher confusing plots and like matt damon and franka potente then you would enjoy this movie 610,intelligence
this movie was a lot better than i was expecting  somewhat of a cross between ronin and die another day it was an intriguing spyaction flick  matt damon comes across as a very good action hero which remains to be seen with his buddy ben affleck in daredevil and the action sequences and fight scenes are done very well  most hollywood action sequences are overblown and unbelievable see xxx but this movies scenes were believable and fun to watch and more importantly it did an excellent job of not allowing the action to upstage the plot  it easily ranks as one of my top 5 movies of 2002,intelligence
this taut thoughtfulattimes actioner works a lot better if you havent read robert ludlums book or its two sequels the bourne ultimatum and the bourne supremacy  if you have read them youve probably developed an emotional attachment to david webb the real name of the man whose cover identity was jason bourne and his wife mariethus youll be offended by the characters played by matt damon and frank potente resemble the ludlum players in name only  indie director doug liman has thrown away most of the book save the title and the basic situation of the main character being an amnesiac who is dismayed at the talents he discovers in himself talents which point toward his bring an assassin which david webb in the book is notthe reputation of jason bourne as a hit man is a plantthe new film sports some good acting from damon who is not yet a great or accomplished actorbut may very well be a great actor in the making  from the time of good will hunting and dogma he has shown enormous promise and still does  franka portente is a strange mixture at least to american audiences of strength alternating with vulnerability the fact that shes quite goodlooking but not a pepsodentsmile modeltype is rather refreshing  good support from brian cox and chris cooper who seems to be a dead ringer for lloyd bochnerremember his legendary line from the twilight zone episode to serve man  its a cookbook he screamsand hilariously his character apropos of nothing repeats the line in naked gun iiback to bourne identity  if youve not read the book youll probably like it  if you are a ludlum fan look for the vhs of the 1988 tv version with richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith  not a perfect adaptation by a long stretch but at least an honest attempt to be faithful to the original,intelligence
i originally went to see this movie out of sheer boredom and it certainly brightened up my day matt damon is generally not everyones idea of the all action hero but he excells in this movie and quickly becomes very believable as the deep cover operativeassassin franka potente is certainly going to be on many producers wanted list after this extremely competant performance it made a pleasant change for the action scenes of which there are many not to detract from a solid and well thought out story line the main character of this spy thriller behaves very much as you might expect and quickly becomes a believable spy on the run who fortunately does not have the invisible cars and exploding wrist watches that ruin for me anyway other spy based movies you will thoroughly enjoy this film as long as you dont go expecting billion dollar effects and exotic locations this movie does the job very well with its realistic approach to a man on the run plenty of gunfights hand to hand and explosions but always believable  oh and there is also a mini car chase that gives the italian job a run for its money  great stuff,intelligence
this flick could have just as easily starred jean claude van damme in the starring role what with all the heavy acting skills that the script demanded cough coughbut still it was sort of fun to watch,intelligence
once again folks a movie that doesnt hold a candle to the book it is supposedly based on if you want to see a good adaptation of this book i suggest that you rent the richard chamberlain versionfirst of all though i am a huge fan of matt damon and he does a good job of acting in this movie he is waaay too young to play the part of jason bourne a seasoned cia operative if you are the type who just likes action for actions sake you will probably like the film on the other hand if you are a fan of ludlums intricate plots and character development you will cry like a babythe role of the female lead was completely butchered a strong female lead was turned into an irrelevant dingbat if youre just out for thrills chills and spills more power to yabut if you like a well told story dont bother with this one im glad i didnt blow money at the theatre on this one,intelligence
why did they even call it other than having some resemblance at the beginning and even that was really different and a couple of familiar names the movie was a completely different story that being said i somewhat enjoyed iti just was completely unprepared for how different it was from the book which probably jaded me a little soif you read the book pretend that you are watching something completely different and you will like what you see710andy,intelligence
of all the years i have studied martial arts and the different styles is the most realistic display of street defense in the arts     the movie is not an overkill of martial arts display but has a realistic touch of what to do in the street that is quite efficient against multiple armed attackers and unarmed attackers it lacks the exaggerated useless moves of most boring martial arts films  the modest but effective choreographic scenes in this film could be used for realistic training purposes  they are outstanding,intelligence
this one is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time smart with an adrenaline rush i dont have much to say im trying to find out my words but this is an awesome movie,intelligence
matt damon once again shows that his acting ability is much greater than his buddy ben  damon transforms himself into an action antihero in this dark film  there were some editingplot holes bourne puts his red bag in a locker and then all of a sudden has it again but overall a very solid film,intelligence
this isnt as flashy as die another day which i also liked but its suspenseful and fast moving it also takes the time to develop the characters so its an engaging people story too i loved the car chase through the streets of paris,intelligence
ludlum would be proud i expected a gun blazing no thought hardcore fast paced action zone and i was wrong this is not new grounds big shot with martial arts and weapons training loses his memory and the people on both sides rush after him in a dead or alive frenzy nobody to trust nowhere to run nothing to help bring back the past seen it dozens of times memorable ones being the hit flick the long kiss goodnight and jackie chans version in who am ibut there is something refreshingly new about this movie the actings great direction is cool and vfx is not unnecessarily flaunted all i can think of saying is that i thoroughly enjoyed it and the storyline is brilliant what more could you ask for the movie is fast paced but kind of slower than i expected im not complaining mind you i loved the movie its just that i expected more but there is a fantastic surge of excitement throughout the movie i definitely recommend it both for the casual movie goer and for ludlum fans even if the plot is very different from that in the book the characters were handled smoothly a sense of realism surrounds the entire movie except for a part in the central theme which i cannot discuss without revealing the climax not that it contains much of a suspensejason bourne is one character ill remember for a while the way he is represented tormented bullet ridden castaway with one hell of an identity crisis tortured at every step of revelation he finds things about himself that he just cant live with and even reaches a point where he doesnt want to know any more the plot proceeds so casually and wonderfully that you cant help but confesswell yeah i suppose that is the only step he can take its like you know that in the situation given the only logical and reasonable step to take would be the one shown in the moviei give it two thumbs up as soon as i stop typing that is,intelligence
as always youre in danger of plot spoilers reading beyond thisjason bourne is really really confused  he regains consciousness on a ship at sea with a stranger performing impromptu surgery on him  with no memory of how hed gotten there nor who he is he tries to retrace his life and figure things out  how surprising then to find out that there is someone or someones trying to kill himand he has astounding selfdefense skills he didnt know he hadthis is the premise of  matt damons nuanced and sensitive performance of jason bourne keeps this thriller from sinking into just another entry in that genre  when he makes startling discoveries about his past identity he actually shows it  gasp  a sensitive caring assassin  whoda thunk it  as the plot barrels forward with stunning stunts and excellent acting from damon and his reluctant sidekick the always phenomenal franka potente run lola run is well worth viewing,intelligence
this movie had so much potential it had some sweet action sequences and the driving scene was awesome the plot could of been way betterover all a solid 7 damon does a fine job in an action film but their was no great ending although surfing the guy down at the end was nothing but awesomeness,intelligence
with this movie it proves that most american directors do not know how to shoot a fight scene correctly  doug liman is trying to make matt damon look like jet li but to no avail  the camera is undoubtedly sped up to make the fight scenes look more realistic but thats not even the worst part  the worst part is the awful framing of the fight scenes  what is with all of the pov shots that american directors love to do in fight scenes  i know that they are trying to put me the audience into the fight but i dont want to be in the fight  i want to watch the fight as it unfolds another director that does this in all of his movies is michael bay the rock pearl harbor  the only american directors that have gotten it right are the wachowski brothers the matrix  once again proving that there is no action like asian action,intelligence
i have a mode of judging movies before they open in theaters  if a movie enjoys a massively huge mediablitz weeks before the premiere that movie either is ridiculously stupid or cant survive on its quality  take for example the failed solaris  i remember seeing commercials on television five and six weeks before the movie premiered  and the movie tankedmy point is that universal did a similar media blitz for and i immediately dismissed it as another boxoffice flop waiting to happen  but from chatter with friends the movie seemed to be better than i was led to believei decided to wait until the dvd came out since most theaters in seattle lack dts audiowith its fresh take on a familiar story line very similar to the long kiss goodnight among others this movie combines a witty script and camera choreography that left me leaning toward my screen  credit must be handed to matt damon who plays jason bourne a man who wakes up not knowing where or who he is  but when facing trouble his instinct releases military training superceding that of even special ops commandosthe dts audio providing clear and crisp audio for even the background effects the vibrant music mixed perfectly with amazing action sequences edited with amazing precision caused me to be thoroughly impressed with the quality of this moviei still hold to my method of judging which movies ill watch in my local crummy theatre but sometimes theres a pleasant surprise mixed in with the rest  910,intelligence
disclaimer i havent seen the tv adaptation and nor have i read ludlums novel though i intend tothree things surprised me about first that matt damon could realistically pull off the extreme action aside from his age am i the only one that thinks hes looked 21 forever i had no problem accepting damon as the consummate assassinavecamnesia he worked in those impressive hand to hand sequences  grimacing sweating bleeding  and overall he pulled off the intensity bourne would have to havesecond that the film would be so smart  yes of course there are cliches but how in the world can you have a spy movie without cliches  what im talking about though is deeper  the director of the film consciously chose to believe in an audience willing to think  for example in one short sequence bourne has found shotgun shells in a strange house and desperately needs to find the shotgun quickly  from his pov the camera flashes to a childs toys childrens books and immediately bourne checks the highest spot in the room knowing that the houses owner wouldnt leave the shotgun in reach of a child  its quick  blink blink shotgun  but it and many other similar moments gives the audience a realtime idea of how fast bourne thinks and actsthird that franka potente  a relative unknown  could carry herself beside a big name like damon  shes very very good moving from fear through fascination and desire back to fear again  and as i indulge my sexist self shes also beautifuli give and 8 out of 10  its my favorite spy flick since daltons license to kill and i may even like it better,intelligence
when i think of spy films generally what comes to mind are the james bond films the misson impossible films the jack ryan series or perhaps even james camerons take on the spy film genre true lies however is more like the jack ryan series in that it is a serious film starring matt damon dogma and chris cooper american beauty is a nice break from the more overdone series of spy films the story centers around a man who has amnesia and with the help of a young woman he tries to discover the secret of his own identity but the truth is difficult to face when he realizes that he is an assassin for the american government  filled with great action sequences and some cool car chases proves to be a thriller that not only provides excitement and intrigue but brains as well ,intelligence
it is not a bad movie  actually it is quite enjoyable and certainly you will have a good evening watching it with friends but dont expect much more  it is a classic variation of a chidrens story except that children get fairies and we get matt damon cia an assassin instead because were grown upssweet dreams my vote  7  10,intelligence
this new adaptation of robert ludlums reasonably famous book as a vehicle for matt damon might work for you if you were born yesterday otherwise its all going to be overtly familiar stuff  as for damon in the lead hes adequate at best in whats basically a mechanical character  franka potenta is well cast as matts love interest but again its a onedimensional sexinterest role  its all bleak and austere and could have benefitted from a dose of humor or dark wit  the director should have studied hitchcocks north by northwest for a little inspiration  too late the hero,intelligence
i dont take in action movies very often as action usual takes precedence over script and acting was a pleasant change damon was superb you could see him scanning the area anticipating the inevitable attack but he never acted totally out of the air no shots fired over the shoulder while making love a la james bond with only one exception the stunts and the action seemed plausible the latter occurs near the end of the movie and is so obviously a do not try this at home move that it jars surely there was a better way to get down the stairsthis is not to say that this is an intellectual or art film far from it but it is marked with excellent acting and a script that does not insult the intelligence of the viewer a good night with the dvd and the alternative ending which demonstrates how in touch the director was the alternate just doesnt play like bourne how can you go wrong with paris as the major backdrop,intelligence
spoiler warningthis is good movie but when hollywood will start paying attention to details for example when was shown russian passport name written in english was foma same in russian was ashf they even didnt bother to pay somebody in russia 5 so it will write correct spelled name they just typed foma with russian codeset which is completely different from english and as result we have a meaningless mess of letters as foma in russianbut it is only one of few drawbacks in this excellent movie,intelligence
the only other spyassasin movie that i could think of that had close to the same premise was a long kiss goodnight  however that being said these movies are nothing alike  the movie takes the spy genre in a different direction  it has action and suspense yet is character driven unlike xxx or bond movies    matt damon pulls off the action star thing because he has to acting chops to be believable in the scenes inbetween the action sequences  the arent that many laughs although they try for a few mostly this is a serious movie  and it works well  good movie,intelligence
extremely engaging thriller  completely captivating action sequences that were believable and went well with the drama entrenched plot  you feel the main protagonist confusion and desperation as he struggles to gain control of his upside down life  definitely more satisfying than other unbelievable recent action pictures such as xxx franka potente was an excellent choice as the damsel in distress and love interest   as superb as this movie was put together it also notoriously has the biggest glitch ive ever seen overlooked  especially now on dvd you can freeze frame and study the scene to witness what i did  follows the scene where william wombosi is angrily discussing the attempted assassination attempt on him with his trailing behind aide and a security guard  wombosi walks quickly through his house in a tight black mock turtleneck that shows his massive belly  his holds his sport jacket over his right shoulder  we make a turn into a hallway not only does the security guard dissapear so does wombosis jacket  wombosi descends the stairs still ranting about getting bournes head for a lawn ornament and he passes the open window  bamm  the window shatters and im thinking the sniper hit the aide  no  wombosi now fully wearing the jacket seems to have been facing the window twists and spills his glasses and somehow makes it all the way down the stairs in his aides arms  unbelievable the editors missed this but yes rent or buy it today and catch it,intelligence
i have always liked matt damon films and so when i heard was coming out i knew it would be a good one thank goodness he didnt disappoint from the outset i watched with a trepidation normally reserved for a well executed horror story i think it had that appeal because damon is so convincing as an actor essentially putting me in his situation as i watch all the casts performances were believable in how they reacted to unique situations i find myself criticizing a film mostly because a character definitely wouldnt react in the cliqued way they normally do so to see bourne and marie both as confused as each other whilst in a terrifying chase across europe coupled with the complete lack of bondesqe double entendres was a thoroughly refreshing change i particularly liked the way the film makers substituted special effects for raw tactical based conflict id even recommend my mum see this film 8510,intelligence
i always love reading the reviews of holierthantho people who use this medium and their thesaurus to downgrade people around them instead of giving their opinion and letting you have yours they insist on insinuating you must be an idiot if you like a film they dont well this idiot saw bourne identity 3 times in the theatre and enjoyed it more each time as did the people who accompanied me who cares if it wasnt like the book making movies is a business and the object is to appeal to as many people as possible the box office results prove they were correct in every way finally a story with perfect pacing likable characters and all without unbelievable scenerios that only excite the senses i will buy this movie and be the first in line should sequels come about i recommend this film highly obviously and urge you to see it and dont worry about the book if you like the book read it again this is another version with other ideas that will stimulate the part of your brain that loves to sayfinally something different,intelligence
finally an action movie where cars dont automatically explode on impact and an action sequence doesnt have to be capped off by a witty remark  i was completely impressed by the credit the filmmakers gave the audiencebeyond the lack of cliches the acting was able and solid  the actors took the characters to a level not achieved in the novel and the characters made the action more believable  though the story strays far from the novel i found it engaging though like the other reviewer a little happy hollywood for my taste  the bourne character in the novel is much darkerif you are looking for real action with bite that doesnt make you feel like you could be watching pro wrestling this is the movie for you,intelligence
what does one get when one of his favourite books gets made into a movie starring one of his favourite actors awesome entertainment i was surprised at the casting choice of damon as bourne but i was defintely not disappointed the movie kept me riveted for its whole duration and i was gladand surprised to see a lack of special effects and instead a character driven action movie no saving the world here just a man fighting to survive so that he can discover who he really is this movie ranks at number 4 of my favourites for 2002 just behind minority report lotr spiderman and just edges out signs,intelligence
is probably one of the greatest spy movies to be created this isnt something you should compare to james bond since theyre completely different kinds of movies while i love bond films they really dont include the reality of spy life as this film does matt damon is excellent in this film doing his best performance since good will hunting and rounders not only is the acting top notch the story superb but there are enough fight scenes and car chases to keep the casual movie goer entertained this is based on the novel by robert ludlum who also wrote the bourne supremacy and the bourne ultimatum i really hope they make the other two novels into movies as well a very great piece of workscore 9 out of 10 excellent,intelligence
this movie surprised me in two ways firstly that the action sequences on the whole were realistic and not overdone secondly that matt damon handled the role so very well i had no trouble believing in his characterit follows a standard assassin loses his memory then tries to work out what is going on plot but trundles along quite nicelymy only gripe is with one of the final scenes in the film where damons character is fighting off a group of killers sent to take care of him spoiler in one scene he grabs a body and jumps over the side of some stairs then falls about six or seven flights landing on the body using it to cushion his impact and then staggers away unharmed im not sure about that onebut the action works well enough even that scene due to damons absolute nononsense approach to the scenes there are no glib witticisms no oneliners reminded me a little of action scenes involving steven seagal who lets face it cant act but knows how to fightanyway worth a watch to see what combat sequences should really be like but die another day fans will be sadly disappointed,intelligence
wasnt a bad movie but after reading the book its a pale comparison to robert ludlums work i probably would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if i hadnt read the book first so for those of you who havent watched it and have not read the book i suggest you hold off from reading it until you have seen the movie,intelligence
contrary to expectations is a satisfying actionspysuspense film and its made as though everything after the 1970s never occurred a rather old fashioned movie in texture and technique an overused device like amnesia should have been a liability but never really slows up the intriguing narrative also the audience is ahead of the story when it comes to the mystery of who crossedup the protagonist but again it proves to be less of a stumbling block doug liman as director keeps things strippeddown and on the groundas opposed to the improbable comicstrip antics of james bondand at least makes the proceedings quasiconvincing matt damon as mysteriousactionheroinsearchofhispast is likeable here and does a good job kicking butt unfortunately franka potente has little to do as does julia stiles in an almost throwaway bit part,intelligence
this film is great its so exciting and enjoyable the films so great that the time runs so fast so the two hours feels like  hour its that good i promise i love the the different european cities paris zrich hamburgtoo bad that they werent in the biggest city in scandinavia stockholmill give this film   5,intelligence
the robert ludlumdirected film now showing at te awamutus regent theatre is just different enough to heighten the entertainment level for a starter the main character wakes up aboard a french fishing vessel with bullet holes in his back completely unaware of who he is and why anybody would want to shoot him as the story unfolds the man played convincingly by matt damon discovers he has almost inbuilt skills in the martial arts and is hounded by the american cia who have ordered their operatives to kill him as he makes his way across europe he hooks up with marie kreutz a gypsy girl played with by a frantic franka potente who helps him discover his own identity all this unfolds in between a number of innovative chase scenes that occur in some of europes most beautiful cities from switzerland to paris is a film about choices as the man who discovers he is jason bourne has to decide whether he wants to continue following the path his life has taken him on or do something different it makes the bond movies look like several walks in the park real edge of the seat stuff,intelligence
style  cool just the way agent flicks should be makes james bond look like schwarzenegger music and visual stuff just dances together best possible settings for a spy story paris zurich i love europe,intelligence
whatever you do dont read the book before watching the movie the movie is a pretty standard boy cant remember who he is boy meets girl boy gets in trouble girl get separated from boy boy beats the bad guy boy hooks up with girl again type of story some cool clipsbut not much more the book however has a really good plot and a lot of twists and turns but if you have some time to killsure watch the movie,intelligence
just got out of the cinema for this one it was a good film to watch if you want a chilled night out or when it comes out on videodvd a quiet night inspoilers actually just the plot outline briefly the plot is about a guy bourne  matt damon who is saved by some fishermen from the middle of the med sea he wakes up with two bullet wounds in his back a bank code inserted into his hip and most importantly of all no idea who he is he sets off to find out who he is first stop to the bank where he finds a lot of money passports and a gun by this time his associates are trying to find him and get rid of him as the story unfolds he meets a german woman i think shes in run lola run who says schisse a lot she gets hooked up with him and becomes the love interest of the film so together they try to find out who he is and what he does amidst a lot of shooting and fighting end spoilersi felt that the film was all a little too predictable especially with the love interest and the ending nevertheless the fight sequences and car chase are worth seeing i gave the film a 6 out of 10 for the entertainment value and i would recommend watching this film at least once,intelligence
its an excellent action movie that have all the right ingrediences of a true action movie and when the guy came thrue the window after approximately 12 hour you felt like you moved back two rows in the cinema and that vwas awefull,intelligence
definitely this is not a brilliant movie the plot has nothing new and scenes are exactly like many others in cinema history but it doesnt mean bourne identity is bad not at all matt damon who has shown his talented in many movies is good as the protagonist frank potente as beautiful and talented as always costars it very well too this film is ideal to be seen in a movie theatre for the good quality if the sound and the guaranteed fun,intelligence
this is an almost american movie but it almost doesnt show convincing characters brilliant soundtrack a happy end but almost no heroism no one man saves the world the plot is conventional has almost no surprises and yet i found myself thrilled throughout the film i gave it an 8 for solid entertainment,intelligence
this movie is great popcorn movie without a deep storyline some great action sequences and a surprise ending franka potente is doing great in her first action packed usmovie i only wonder why all great car chases were filmed in paris ,intelligence
i thought the movie was fantastic and the action was smooth and exciting but i thought that the sex between jason and marie was too soon  their attraction should have been more drawn out to create more tension  i think this kind of spoilt the ending  their being reunited should have been more of a surprise and a novelty dont you think,intelligence
nice drama with good acting the story is a little far fetched at some points but i like to escape now  again so i forgive the mini minor makes a welcome comeback to car chasing jason bourne seems not to worry that the owner warns the car pulls slightly to the rightthen he pulls it every way a mini was not meant to be driveni think it could have been 20 minutes shorter but never mind this is a cliffhanger well worth watching i rate it 8 out of 10,intelligence
thats all i want to say a slightly above average quality action movie becomes something you can enjoy when there has been an effort to breathe life into the supporting charactersthat has definitely been done here and i go along with michael okeefes comment pointing out chris cooper and gabriel mann as contributing a lot to the whole thinggreat actor directing mr liman and unlike someone else i think franka potente adds something to the specific feeling of the movie and think in blow she was excellent damon is surprisingly sober and efficient no complaints outstanding dialogs be they ludlum pure or reinvented the rythm is special the multiple countries visited almost get us into that travelingagencyadd feeling terrible flaw in so many movies but fortunately we mainly stick to paris which is a good thing it would be a shame if we hadnt been given the minichase really nice work just to say the action doesnt come short here most reviewers here before me seemed to agree on thatin the genre a great job with a little extra what more can we ask for ,intelligence
this movie was a real rideit has some great action scenes and a breath taking car chase that comes close to the one on the movie ronin with de nironowmatt damon is no de niro but he can pull off the action scenes and the jet lee ability to handle guys without gunsfranka potente is not as good as in lola rennt and could have  been replaced by any second class actress because of her two dimensional character choose any new good looking chick from hollywood julia styles comes out as a character the movie really didnt need so you can guess they used her to get some teen audiencethe bad guys play their roles well enough and the story is interesting but sometimes the movie slow down and if youre sleepy youre gonna need a good cup of coffee to keep up with it ill give it a good 9 out of 10 on action movies with matt damon,intelligence
as a long time reader of ludlum the guy who wrote the jason bourne triology i can only say that this film was a total dissapointment only two things seem similar between the book and the film  one is the title and the other is that the plot involves a us agent with amnesia every other thing has been changed from the namenationality of the female lead right down to the very reason jason bourne existed in the first placeinstead of destroying the plot of an excellent book why did they not give it a different title and sell it out as a run of the mill spy caper ludlum would turn in his grave if he saw his intricate plot reduced to this piece of dogmeal ill stick with the earlier tv version at least that tried to give an accurate portrayal of the book in the time they were allowed no treadstone 71 plot no cain plot no carlos plot  no plottin good,intelligence
the analysis on this film by tedg is unbelievably bad this guy has to be a total jerk from mit this type of guy should stay away from mainstream movies and stick to ones either only with subtitles or ones which are only shown in theatres with a maximum occupancy of 10 people they can all sit and over analyse their movies with their so called superior intellectis quite simply an entertaining movie from start to finish very exciting great scenes and a brilliant performance from matt damonnuff said,intelligence
most of the commentaries that you can read about this film are focused in how it closes or not about the robert ludlums book but i think that this film represents a valuable effort to update the feels and phobias that we had in those cold war years matt damon makes a great performance as bourne that i feel the obligation to write these lines by the way i loved the bourne trilogy books and i think that this film pays its tribute to the ludlums characters,intelligence
for those who like actions movies like me the movie has a lot to offer the super man highly skillful in martial arts so keen that he can figure out someone is trying to kill with a long distance rifle just be missing a dog that is not his in a house he happened to sleep for one night is a very fast paced movie you do not feel bored a second it has some overexaggerated scenes as when jason bourne matt damon jumps from a tenth floor or so using a fat man body as shield for protecting himself from the fall not only he does survive the fall with just a scratch on his forehead but he also kills an assasin on his way downfrank potente plays the bychance partner of matt damon and of course a she becomes more than just a partner at the endi give 7 out of 10 to its good film,intelligence
this remake of the 1988 tv movie is so so the story is pretty solid as most of ludlums work however not very well adapted to the screen the cast were quite flat no big highlights pretty slow sometimes not very hard to foresee the plot i give it a 6,intelligence
if only this movie had anything to do with the robert ludlum novel it could have been a great movie the big question is did the screenwriters actually read the novel of the same name if hollywood cannot bring a screenplay together that holds true to the original novel then they should leave the project alone this movie would have been far more popular if the title had have been no identity cashing in on a successful novel is great provided the movie is actually similar to the novel perhaps peter jackson should have written and directed ,intelligence
if you like an excellent plot great action scenes  more than adequate character actors this movie is for you  on every level this movie delivers  its intellectual script keeps you on your toes as far as what will happen next  moreover the fight scenes are realistic and more than believable  the cast choices give a wide range of character development no matter if their role is small or large all in all this movie wont let you down,intelligence
is a mixture it is an old fashioned hardnosed spy thriller plus some martial arts and hightech equipment  la enemy of the state all in all it is a fast paced movie with little time to breathe which is good okay but not superior matt damon imhois a poor actor but does okay in this one id rather have seen anyone else except ben affleck but hey franka is making up for him and everything else people might not like about the movie you just have to love her dont you macaulay j connor 710,intelligence
i would like to add something about this movie the movies plot and interest is based upon the 2 faces of the main character the discovery of his killer training and nature but the details are unexploited the way he goes through himself the way he discovers himself is inexistent you could watch geena davis in the long kiss goodnight and see how it could be done matt damon plays in a stoneface way never we can see him tortured by his nature yeah except in this ridiculous flashback when hes on the boat and refuses to kill the black guy due to the children the conspiracy training of these killers is inexistent the dying killer in the field speaks about pills for the headache   yeah and do we have to imagine the whole training and plan from the government we feel that all the background that actually exists in the book has been cut another thing is that all the places where damon goes are underexploited always this short view of a city bluefiltered colors a lack of rythm is the great flaw of this movie short action scenes and 30 minutes of blabla that follow in which we learn nothing about the plot oh and i dont even speak about the cute happy ending scene,intelligence
a man matt damon is found floating in the ocean miles from shore by the men of a fishing boat he is presumed dead but quite surprisingly he is alive before he regains consciousness the ships doctor sees two bullet wounds on his back and removes the bullets he also finds another scar that hides a small object which projects some numbers and lettersafter the man regains consciousness he says that he doesnt remember who he is how he was shot or how he ended up floating in the ocean he recovers physically but still has no idea who he isafter he goes ashore in southern france he uses the clue of the numbers and letters that were embedded in his body to start to learn more about who he is including that his name might be jason bourne he meets marie franka potente who helps him which is good since it seems that many people would like to see him deadmeanwhile we see cia agent conklin chris cooper who is trying to clean up after an assassination that was planned but never happened by an agent who has disappearedthe plot is more involved than this to the point where i wasnt 100 sure that i followed everything there are some things that dont make sense and others that seem a bit unlikely but it makes enough sense to avoid distracting you from the action scenes which are the reason this movie exists and which work very well that you dont know exactly whats going on especially earlier in the film keeps the tension effectively high and the acting and the special effects like the story are good enough to avoid distracting youunlike xxx this film is definitely recommended if youre looking for an entertaining action filmseen on 8232002,intelligence
any of major reviews give away most of the plot and thats ok because the story doesnt really keep anything up its sleeve sure the screenplay could have contained twists and doublecrosses galore but that wasnt the story the filmmakers were given to work with most good films can be capsulized in a four word review s could be amnesia spy danger love matt damon is very convincing as the main character whos name may or may not be jason bourne who awakens on a fishing boat with two bullets in his back and no memeory whatsover of who he is or how he got there and alas no id what the movie does extremely well is show how jasons amnesia has not affected his physical and mental capabilities just the memory pertaining to his personal life which must be in a different part of the brain jason spends the rest of the movie running around europe trying to find out who he is while defending himself from known and unknown forces along with protecting a girl marie  played well by franka potente of run lola run fame whos in the game first for money and then eventually love the film has plenty of edgeofyourseat action including a great car chase and plenty of fight scenes with just the right touch of humor romance and mystery on a final note i thought the filmmakers did an excellent job of recreating the look and feel of the eurpopean coldwar thrillers of the late 60s and early 70s specifically through the mix of cinematography and musical score i rate 8 of 10,intelligence
for matt damons first thrilleraction he has set a good example of his rise in the businessis one of the best realistic more witty movies i have had the privilege of seeing this year set in great locations with moscow switzerland and paris and having one of the best on screen supporting actress with franka potente from blow it really set the movie of to blossom into one of the years best movies in my booksfrom doug lilman the director of go and swingers its a change of style for himself with the character wonderfully portraight buetiful setting and one of the coolest car chase scenes i have ever scene he should be awarded for his efforts and can not wait for his next movie to be releaseddo not worry folks ben affleck does not star in this movie just like to set your minds at easethey say that xxx is the new style of james bond but i would have to go with with cunning skills used throughout the movie giving a unique styleif there would be any let downs about the movie it would most likely be the ending very short and to the point but dont let that put you off i would definetely check this one out for yourselfsi will give it a 910and hats off to the cast and crew great job,intelligence
this movie didnt have any overexposure by the press and was probably only heightened by matt damon coming to australia to promote it i thought it was a good film and matt damon plays the part of jason bourne convincingly franka potente fit the role of marie an innocent but curious woman who gets caught up in bournes world by mistake they didnt emphasise the romance between the two characters as a key feature in this movie which was good because that wasnt what the story was suppose to focus on i have to say though the cia must have some lousy agents if they cant gun down one of their own yet that one agent can outsmart them alldidnt they get the same training,intelligence
cia agent jason bourne wakes up in a fishing boat off france and finds himself with amnesia and slowly discovers himself throughout the movie and discovers its not truly what he wants to be he wants to live a normal life with his newly met lover marie kreutz and get out of the life of an assassin the film makes us think about whether we all really want to be where we are and shows us that there is always time for change in a world with many options despite this message the film has great scenes of action and acting in general for an action film there are not too many unbelievable events and the depiction of europe and european culture is reflected wellm ogg brisbane australia,intelligence
shows what a poor actor matt damon is when there is no director behind the camera this movie reducing the novel not a masterpiece but an enjoyable thriller to its rather poor plot line is one of the most pathetic thriller i have ever seen makes spy game look like a master piece only the secondunit director did some good work the car chase is not bad the rest can be thrown in the depths of the dustbin of movie history  ridiculously bare plot no real character only ridiculous stereotypes nobody to direct the actors a thorough disaster,intelligence
a good action film considering the pg13 rating  the suspense is there well mostly but overall it is still a straight forward action film  the ending wrapped up a little too quickly for my taste but overall it is a good friday night movie,intelligence
i went to see the movie because of go liman and was ready for a disappointment damon in it but it was much more than i expected i even thought damon was ok why do people keep comparing it to the book i do not doubt the book may be better but the movie stands on its own great direction and cinematography for the type of movie that it is nice not to see a dozen hollywood stars packed in it 810ps great shots of mykonos in the end so blue and cold instead of the yelloworange colours that prevail there impressive,intelligence
a lot of bond movies can learn from a film like this its a hell of a lot more realistic and it contains some excellent martial arts scenesin a lot of ways it is the opposite of a bond movie take the chase around paris sequence does our hero elude the bad guys in a flash swanky cool aston martin no instead he eludes them in a bashed up miniwho would have known that matt damon would have made a great action hero i hope they go through with the sequel if it does ill be first in line 75 out of 10,intelligence
considering director liman produces films with title such as kissing jessica stein shows how vaccuous he is  this film really trashes any credibility a director would have  first we have matt damon who just hosted the new awful saturday night live  in this film he plays an amnesiac who has a gun speaks many languages knows martial arts has thousands of dollarsand doesnt have a clue who he is cia assassinnaahhhhh  franka potente who was excellent in run lola run cant figure it out either  so he goes through the film killing a whole bunch of people and he doesnt even know why or who they are       very disappointing film and the interesting european locale doesnt help this film in the least from being anything but a boring waste of time and the dialogue  inane as you can get  we are supposed to believe franka potente is that dumb and we already know from run lola run that she isnt but you cant blame her im sure they paid her a whole bunch of money for this poor poor role,intelligence
as the rogue cia plot is collapsing in careerending disarray the idiot responsible for the whole mess arrives on site to do damage control  he checks in with julia stiles to make sure shes destroyed the evidence  we never see her again on camera  the next time we see him hes hurriedly leaving the building for an appointment with his executioner as it turns outmy thought  i wonder if after making sure the stiles has destroyed the evidence he didnt just shoot her  after all her memory was evidence tooi suspect stiles murder was filmed but left on the editing room floor after all we already hated the guy so we didnt need more crimes laid on him  and stiles character though part of the antibourne conspiracy was pretty much an innocent pawn  in fact i kept expecting her to realize what her coworkers were really up to and then either confront her boss which would then insured her getting killed or bolt and go to warn bournemy theory  preview audiences didnt like her death so she gets to presumably live,intelligence
this movie has a really feel to it that sucks you in any movie both me20s and my mother in her 50s can watch and both enjoy is a good on in my books franka potente is excellent in this movie  if you are looking for more of her work see anatome also matt damon is perfect for the titular character,intelligence
i live in zurich switzerland and ive just seen the movie dear guys in hollywood i mean its really funny what you expect switzerland to be but for the next time make a better research and make your movies at the original spotsfirst of all in switzerland we understand it yet we dont speak german swissgerman is a language at its own the police never behaves like that that was closer to the 2nd worldwar gestapo we dont have french ambulances the central station is not the same as paris gare de nord shown in the movie and the tramways look completly different although congratulations for getting the right color and destination for the tramway no10 but just mentionning the fact that no10 doesnt pass near any bank in zurich  they are all located in the bahnhofstrasse and if you wanna get to paris you dont need to cross the alps as shownso the movie turned to be sort of a sad comedy for the first half an hour and we made a lot of jokes throughout the whole audience i know all other peole around the world dont give a damn about any of these points above yet no one would ever have the idea to shoot a film about new york in los angeles that would be a hell of a scandal in the uslast but not least its not a bad movie ive seen worse and its very positive to see just a normal spy thriller without any bondlike impossible gadgetbull yet after reading the book the story is really shallowi understand that reading today is out but if you wanna have a really good thrill by with ten times more chases and a much better and challenging story its absolutely worth to read the book i guarantee that,intelligence
if i hadnt read robert ludlums book id have loved this moviethe story is ok acting is good and the action is excellent i liked when jason bourne suddenly remembers hes good at martial artsat this point id have given 810however as i did read the books i think the plot is too much different in the movie than in the bookswhy an african dictator instead of carlos the international professional killer  why did jason bourne fail his mission  in the books seeing the dictators children would not have stopped him killing the guy why is maries character so different than the one in the books  shes supposed to be a canadian economist not a homeless german girli thought that if the first bourne movie was good they might have done the 2 sequels as well but now i wonder how they could achieve this as the story is completely differenti am really disappointed that robert ludlum executive producer gave his greenlight to thisso i give this movie a 6510 rating,intelligence
this film is one of the better action films in recent years matt damon is fairly good in his acting and youll find that he rocks in some of the martial arts scenes  the film has really cool car chase and youll laugh when youll see bourne surfing on a mans back chris cooper was great as conklin so was brian cox in his character  julia stiles is always great but she should have picked a better role than this one better yet they should have given a struggling actress the job she takes calls thats it franka potente plays a woman who chooses to stay with bourne while hes being chased but you can easily tell that bourne wants to be with her mainly because of her body theres a nice twist in the end where the reason of bournes mission failure is revealed anyways great action go see it,intelligence
is an action spy thriller  it opens with our main protagonist jason bourne matt damon awaking in the ocean with 2 bullets in his back and with no memory of his life  we follow his journey as he attempts to figure out who he is and why everyone appears to be trying to kill himbourne fights is an action spy thriller  it opens his way out of sticky situations gets involved in car chases apparently done by the team that did the famous ronin chases and fights his way out of even stickier situations all the while slowly piecing the puzzle togethermatt damon as weve come to expect turns in a great performance as bourne who is a cia agent that seems very well trained in the martial arts franka potente of run lola run fame plays the female interest brilliantly adding much believability and warmth to the roledoug liman has done a terrific job directing this film making it a very fast paced suspenseful thrillermy rating 12,intelligence
ended up being different to what i expected i went to see it having not read the book or having read any reviews of it i was expecting a spyespionage movie but what i got was just as good the movie is fast paced and unlike some action oriented movies is able to convincingly sustain such a fast paced plot while the plot may at first seem detailed and complex it is revealed well by the movie as each new element fits into the overall jigsaw puzzlethe movie is not weighed down by too many characters central to the plot the handful of central characters all put in solid performances damon is very convincing and shows he is maturing rapidly as an actor the necessary female character while well played by franka potente was a little too cliched for my liking overall is a well made film that is well worth a look for people after a bit more substance in an action movie810,intelligence
yeah that was great  a really good moment in the movie theatre good actors good story and an amazing car chase one of the best i have ever seen the only thing was that the paris geography is a little messed up but that is not important go and see it ,intelligence
when i went to the cinema bourne identity was not my first choice of film however after choosing it as a second choice i realised that it was more my sort of film there are various elements of different genres or at least styles thriller action martial arts conspiracy all come into play at some point rather then a simple theyre going to get me ill fight back film the amnesia element gives us a sense of really following matt damons character from the beginning of his new life the action scenes are cleverly executedand the mini chase scene was extremely well thought out and filmed there are several intelligent moments when jason bourne finds a new talent for example language and how he tries to explain his memory lossaltogether this film is solid and fast paced throughout the action never stops and when it does it is replaced my moments of intrigue and suspense the ending may be simple but in one way this adds to the style and charm of the film810,intelligence
is an excellent film but not the finest movie of the year  it has redeeming qualities in the action scenes and even though they are unbelievable they seem logical for this picture  i went away with a sense of money well spent,intelligence
the film was quite entertaining but didnt really carry itself off as a genuine blockbuster  which im assuming it was selling itself as matt damon cut his teeth well in the action hero role and i think well be seeing more of him in this respect  the plot was thin to say the least and it almost turned into a road movie more than anything else at the start when the premise was being setup there was enough to keep me interested but the middle section seemed to run out of steam the last bit didnt really feel like a ending at all but went with the film i feel that the film tried to be too many genres at once at some points emotional at others an action film and sometimes a thriller type affair the pastiche doesnt work however and given a two hours rewind in time and this knowledge i wouldnt go and see the film,intelligence
star ratingunmissablevery goodokayyou could go out for a meal insteadavoid at all costsis a fairly interesting spy thrillerthere are some fairly entertaining action scenes but the plot drags in parts and it has to be said matt damon isnt the most appealing action leading man in the world,intelligence
in australia recently to promote his latest film the wouldbe espionage thriller toothy superstar matt damon was at his most amiable whilst running the media gauntlet surprisingly he was able to maintain his composure even during the most inane of questions this was especially the case during a press conference via videolink between adelaide and melbourne the adelaide media contingent was out in force ranging from the overly earnest scribes of university publications to fawning bow tie wearing film critics and most unfortunately exfootballers who appear hellbent on turning any news story into a footy fuelled farce nevertheless amid this avalanche of absurdity damon did make one candid and telling comment regarding the story itself isnt that original what makes it unique is its style and execution herein lies the dilemma with this updating of robert ludlums 1980 bestseller previously filmed as a television miniseries in 1988in matt damon plays a victim of amnesia who is found floating near death in the ocean during a storm what few clues he has regarding his identity are troubling  there is a swiss bank security box containing several passports featuring his photograph his uncanny skill with guns and martial arts and most disturbingly two bullet wounds in his back he soon finds himself on the run attempting to uncover his past before a horde of mysterious secret agents can assassinate him numerous shootouts and a car chase ensue including what appears to be a fairly lethargic homage or is it just product placement to the famous mini sequence in the 60s classic the italian job another film currently being remade fortunately audiences are seemingly spared any computer enhanced fight sequences that are de rigueur in action films although towards its conclusion features a stunt that is so outrageous it may well go down in cinematic infamymatt damon is obviously hoping to establish a film franchise with his first foray into the action genre with two further bourne novels in print and healthy us box office for this installment it is highly likely that we will see more of him in the role hopefully this will be a character that he can grow into as damon who turns 32 next month is perhaps currently too young for the partindie director doug liman swingers go and writer tony gilroy have taken robert ludlums coldwar tale and attempted to invest it with 21st century sensibilities unfortunately beyond the cunning casting of hip eurostar franka potente from run lola run wasted as the obligatory love interest and a contemporary score featuring the likes of moby and paul oakenfold appears hopelessly anachronistic the uniquestyle and execution that matt damon spoke of during his interview are sadly lacking perhaps the film would have fared better had the original era and east versus west tensions of the novel been maintained after the relentless energy of director limans cult favourite go this somnambulistic spy saga is a major disappointment that once again suggests many filmmakers do their most interesting work outside the hollywood system,intelligence
an enjoyable thriller to watch great action scenes chases sexy leads but what was it all about perhaps i missed a bit but i do like my thrillers to make feel that they have carried me along rather than my falling off somewhere towards the end it is good fun but as too often these days the necessary thriller scenario is there but not enough substance beneath surprised exec prod ludlum did not want more depth,intelligence
i read the book in my teens and loved the first film with richard chamberlain  he was much older and the character in the book if i remember correctly was not as active as the new version  the fight scenes in the new film are brilliant and altho there is some mindless violence to fulfill the testosterone bulging viewers its not over the top  i loved the obligatory car chase even better for it being in a mini i love it when americans make films in europe cos i can play spot the well known european actor id give it a 910 for an action film same old themes rehashed but exceptionally well done this time,intelligence
lead character doesnt know who he really is is hardly a new storyline but this is still a good way to spend an hour or two matt damon is perhaps too young to be really convincing in this role but the movie still keeps your attention lots of unidentified people filling key roles in the story obvious to say since the story is set in europe but the movie has a very european feel which i havent seen for a while and it gives the film a certain credibility ending is bit lame but is short enough to not ruin the whole story,intelligence
straightforward auctioneer thats not overindulgent or fantastic  having read ludlums commercial potboiler as in the early 80s as a kid i expected possibly a louder bgrade flashbang version of the dull 1988 tv movie starring richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith  im glad to say that the film is better although there are many changes to turn it into a blockbuster action show  it delivers a quite consistent level of well shot actionviolence frankenheimers excellent ronin with its european setting comes to mind and easytounderstand intrigue  no bond gadgets john woo bullet ballets or gangsta pansy posing  people complaining about it lacking the depth of the book cant seem to understand the booktofilm transition and that this is no classic literary tome in the first placedespite damons natural easygoing boyish charm his character remains a cold professional throughout curt in speech and clinical in action commanding authority even when he decides to bang the chick  it could have been a talented mr ripley conflict of coldness and vulnerability but bourne comes across in the end as lacking any strong characterisation probably quite apt for a professional killer  this opens the film to arguments that the characters are never fleshed out properly which is not important here the female interest franka potente grows increasingly irritating as lola becomes tired of runningbeing released in competition with another actioneer with a european setting the flashy xxx with vin diesel delivers a professional hollywood job with a euro feel despite the indie roots of the director doug liman  probably wont win any oscars but it sure wins a place in my shortlist for dvd buys  well made watchable entertainment,intelligence
the film was good a lot of action but definitely not like the book which is actually a little disappointing because the book is really good and very interesting but matt damon did a good job i didnt think of him as an action guy which in this film was quite good because the jason bourne is not the person whom youd think would be any good at well  anything that has to do with kicking and weapon so if youve read the book and cant think of any good reason why anyone should change the book into plain action  then dont see it its nothing like the book,intelligence
a wounded jason bourne matt damon finds himself on a fish boat with no recollection lucky for us he regains all normal functions and proceeds to investigate himself spoilers he has a pin number tattooed on his arm which leads him to a bank account he uses prior selfdefense to avoid apprehension he recruits a troubled lady and offers her a large payment in exchange for a ride to paris when they arrive he finds his old apartment but still cant remember anything meanwhile the cops are looking for him by request of the government they avoid apprehension and hideout at friends amidst the chaos matt and the lady fall in lovehonestly this movie was a little too boring and apparently parallel to inferno which was probably a rip off of the original television show  the characters failed to involve the audience emotionally i find the fault in the movies premise not the acting which was fine matt damon did a good job with a mediocre script although i have to admit inferno though parallel was a great deal more entertaining i found myself anticipating the ending despite some neat action sequences,intelligence
even though the timing wound up being accidental due to delayed opening dates friends matt damon and ben affleck went head to head with action thrillers in the 2002 summer box office season both based on famous novels and doing rather well  this was damons entry and he came off better than expected  he plays an amnesiac who soon finds out that he has a past full of violence and intrigue  hes accompanied by potente a financially strapped girl who makes the mistake of getting involved then cant break free of the drama surrounding him  hard to believe but true these parts were essayed by richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith in a 1988 tv miniseries  the film is stylish nicely paced and for the most part more realistic and less showy than its competitors although a scene near the end involving a staircase shatters that whole idea and crosses the line damon is comfortable and likable  he appears to be doing much of the fight choreography and does it well  he isnt always entirely believable as an amnesiac but his natural charm goes a long way  potente takes a while to warm up  she is more facially inexpressive than an american actress might have been but eventually she comes along  damon shows little sexual interest in her until shes free of make up and he gives her a short hair cut making her look a little more like affleck  hee hee  naturally he uses the worlds dullest scissors yet she emerges with a vidal sassoonish up to the minute eurotrash style  damon looking awfully cute with dark hair and matching eyeliner for some reason never has to adopt any sort of disguise while hes on the run  the casting in this film is bizarre cooper though a solid actor hasnt got nearly enough charisma to pull off his key role  owen who has starred in smaller better films is barely onscreen at all and not one word of his dialogue is intelligible  stiles is ludicrously miscast and unnecessary  aside from a very drab start the film moves and has interesting locations exciting set pieces and some nice production values  recommended for people who havent read the book and for people that have read the book but dont mind some tweaking,intelligence
from the start to the finish you wont be making a coffee  you wont take your eyes off it  you will want more   it delivers  marvelous fantastic best film seen this year  worth waiting in the rain have to get my mates to go and watch it,intelligence
this has all the potential of a great film it is a great idea with a good interesting cast not jam packed with big namesthe film starts well enough and looks beautiful the filming of parts of europe looks great and makes this a far more interesting film than your averagebut it loses the plot part way through the film it has this great idea starts the film in an interesting way but then doesnt really know how to progress the story and then finish iti walked out of the cinema feeling that i had seen a film which could have been really great but instead i was left feeling short changed the great ending i expected just never surfacedsuch a shame,intelligence
jason bourne matt damon has a nasty case of amnesia after being plucked unconscious out of the mediterranean sea but its not long until he discovers that he was a trained assassin for the cia one problem though hes now marked for death from the very organization he used to work for with the unexpected assistance of a swiss woman franka potente in a surprisingly strong performance whom he pays 20000 for a ride to paris bourne struggles to regain memory of his past while trying to stay alive the solid screenplay  based on the late robert ludlums bestselling 1980 novel  by tony gilroy and william blake herron is well crafted and finely paced complete with solid dialogue and some great action sequences such as what turns out to be one of the films best scenes a thrilling car chase with a cooper mini  through the streets of paris which is accented with great cinematography and music by paul oakenfold bourne is a most refreshing alternative that distances itself from the nonsense thats been clogging theaters all year if damon surgically removed himself from ben affleck hed be a worldwide phenomenon after movies like this 8510,intelligence
this movie screams class modesty and intense action all at the same time the acting is honest the production aside from a couple of minor continuity errors who cares is superb and the story although seen a few times before under different guises is brought to the screen with a fresh and realistic angle the action is believable and continual the fight sequences are very well choreographed with a wincingly realistic edge and thank god  no corny one liners after each physical encounter very refreshing is fast paced without leaving the viewer feeling confused at certain points or patronized by its simplicitythe music is excellent setting the mood for each scene convincingly when required and gets the adrenalin going around the action and especially the fight sequencesoverall a gutsy well polished piece thatll instantly make you want to get your fat arse get down the gym before applying for assassin school and a new passport go and see it,intelligence
a guy who is more professional than the saint and cooler than james bond but who has lost his memorythis is robert ludlum style the movie itself is never boring although you know how it has to end the action scenes are simply fantastic expecially the melee fighting style of jason bourne but of course weve seen that in many other movies beforethe performance of the actors is very goodespecially the performance of franka potente and of course matt damon the 2 main actors but also chris coopersas a european i appreciated that the whole movie took place in europe paris switzerland etcto summarize my thoughts the movie is good although we had the plot very often it does not get boring actors performance is quite good i wouldnt go to the cinema again to see it a second time but on tv i will watch it whenever its on,intelligence
given movies like die another day and xxx its refrshing to see something like this getting made a simple action story with great actors this is my favourite surprise hit of the year the only quibble is that matt damon looks ten years younger than his supposed fellow agents but that is minor dithering about seeing this dont go see it and enjoy a retro spy movie that thankfully isnt a parodyoh and famke potente is sexy as hell,intelligence
close but no cigar this movie could have been great instead it assumes the audience of today will not sit for over two hours and are less interested in character interaction and romance than in things blowing up and people getting killed in spectacular wayscertainly the film is slick beautifully shot and edited the thrills are there as is the violence but there is no heart to this film the book excelled in portraying the humanity of the lead character and it carefully developed the romance and the relationship between marie and bourne and made that relationship critical to the ultimate success of the hero what do we get in the movie a hurried onenight stand which although believable in its inevitability is unconvincing as a harbinger of a deeper emotional link between the couple the elements are there but they do not come together largely because of ill advised plot changes she is a street wise loner as opposed to an intelligent academic to whom the world of jason bourne is in utter contrast to the mcgill university depicted in the book there is an intellectual as well as a physical connection in the book and the tv movie incidentally so jettisoning the old fashioned elements of the plot was in my opinion a mistakefranka potente has been quoted as saying that she found the character of marie in the book to be unbelievable in todays context and therefore the character was redrawn to be more gritty and street wise how unfortunate movies like casablanca or the big sleep or from here to eternity and so on are still beloved by movie fans largely due to these films old fashioned story and character elements that todays audience will not accept such themes is an unproven assumptioni will probably buy the dvd and the film may grow on me with time but right now i think ill go and watch peter jacksons frighteners and enjoy how he develops both the thrills and the romance between michael fox and trini alvarado in perfect balance,intelligence
im an action movie guy and i  loooooove action films so having read the book and the others in the trilogy the only works of robert ludlums that excited me i had high hopes for and sure enough there was plenty of action good acting and special effects the romance did work for me and im looking forward to seeing matt damon againunfortunately the plot seemed to meander and the film lacked tension at odd times while i was glad the film didnt go into silly superhuman stunts like james bond does there was something about the buildup and presentation that just didnt click for me could somebody email me to explain it is that what the cinematographer doesfor example when the action scenes were done with a blitz sequence of little half second shots that was just confusing for me it didnt work and without giving away the ending let me just say that i was actually surprised the film ended because there wasnt the usual big high stakes at work but its not nearly as bad as gone in 60 seconds which was flaccidwho should see this film action movie buffs but only on a rainy day unless you like sort of empty flicks like oceans eleven ill give a 6 out of 10 catch run lola run which also stars franke potente,intelligence
do not get me wrong i thought the film was good and very well made but i had read the book so this means that i know want its supposed to be based on and it was not even closethe only aspects of the book they kept were jason bourne losing his memory being picked up by a fishing boat and some of the characters which were completely different like marie in the film she is a german gypsy who drifts around europe but in the book she is half french and canadian and works for the canadian embassyso when i realised the plot wasnt the same as book i decided just to sit back and enjoy the new plot and it was fun but it was not as complex and as exciting as the book the car chase was great and the fight seem were extremely realistic the cool fight scenes are an aspect of the book matt damon and franka potente were excellent in the movie especially matt damon who i think would of been perfect also if he was given the complex character of the bookso if you have read the book then go and see the film because it may not be the same but it still jason bourne and what more can i say if you have enjoyed the film but not read the book then go to your book store now and buy it because its one that you cant put downfilm  710   book  1010,intelligence
audiences  critics have identified director doug limans new film as a very wellcrafted flick however there have been others who have renamed it the bored identity i could see why some have said the latter since the film does drag at times however i mostly have to agree with the former because is just one cool amnesiac spy flick matt damon stars as jason bourne poor mr bourne is a superspy who suffers from amnesia on the streets of paris he teams up with the beautiful franka potente and now we have a identity case of 2 innocent fugitives on the run who are now being chased by everybody and their bourne relatives  forefathers damon does a credible job as bourne who is good well hunted throughout most of the film franka potente is illuminating as the innocent girlontherun potente proves she has a lot acting potential is one film that you should identify to see quickly  good,intelligence

i saw it at a screening last week and it surprised me i really liked it full of action excitement and romancealthough not to much romance that is not to original but hey original isnt automaticly very good good to see matt damon as action hero something different than the evil but bit dorky mr ripley8 of 10 just for amusement factor,intelligence
not too long ago when reviewing the sum of all fears i wrote of what we all experience at one time or another when seeing a film based on a book weve read  as i was leaving the house and driving across the river and entering the theater to see i was having that quandary once again  id read the robert ludlum novel almost fifteen years ago and i recently reread it just to make things even more difficult for myself i suppose im a glutton for punishment  id liked the story  id even kindasorta liked the richard chamberlainjaclyn smith tv movie version in 1988  the novel was a little melodramatic in parts but on the whole it was an intelligent involving action story that incorporated technogadget spytoys of the day late 1970s in a realistic fashion  moving that story forward twenty years while staying true to the source material would be a challengeill come back to that point shortly but i also wanted to touch on some of the developmental hell this film went through in order to make it to the screen and how all of that affected the finished product  those who follow the movie business know that this film was shot in late 2000 and early 2001 and meant to be released in the fall of 2001 but 911 pushed that back  then after test audience results came back unfavorably cast and crew were recalled to european locations to shoot a new ending in january of 2002 and the release date was pushed back even further  it is something of a truism that when such things happen the movie is almost beyond saving and will probably stinkoh the story  man is pulled from the mediterranean sea his body riddled with bullets a microchip surgically implanted in his hip and no memory of anything that happened before he was fished from the sea  the microchip leads him to a bank in zurich where the first clues to his identity are revealed and the more the man learns the less he likes what it appears he is  picking up an unwitting accomplice in zurich in the form of a young woman who gives the man a ride to paris he ends up implicating her in whatever troubles his past self may have created and relying on her to aid himall that being said did the one thing that a film can do to avoid the novelscreenplay conflict  it threw out the book or at least most of it  and considering the hell that director doug liman and universal studios put each other through the finished product is a wellmade entertaining and fairly believable action thriller  director liman is known for his first two features independently produced swingers and go neither or which unfortunately i have seen  this picture was his majorstudio debut and his reputation as a visually and structurally innovative filmmaker gave me hopes of something stylish and gritty maybe like michael manns work  my guess turned out to be correctthe european locations  marseilles zurich paris the french countryside  are not shown in their travelogueesque glitz and glamour  its winter its snowing and overcast most of the time adding to the gloom of the title characters situation  limans camera work does not disappoint and matt damon delivers a topnotch performance that will add action star to his resume of credentials  the romance between damons character and his slightlyunwilling companion played by german actress franka potente is wellhandled by the screenplay  theres no roll in the hay for the sake of a love scene here the film demonstrates how these two people both cut off from their pasts in manners of speaking seek comfort from their fear and learn to trust one another  the action sequences are not the type seen in your average bullets and profanity pictures they arent gratuitous and with one exception at the end yes in that reshot new ending theyre realisticof course there were three bourne novels written by robert ludlum and doug liman has previously stated that he can envision shooting all three as a trilogy of films starring the jason bourne character  i for one cannot see how that can be done being how the first novel was all but ignored for the making of this film  but the james bond franchise continues to this day some twentyfive years after the producers of those films abandoned the source material  maybe liman and universal will surprise us  however for this summer this film is worth your money especially if you like your action stars not wearing tights or swinging laserswords,intelligence
this is one of those movies where your perception is shaped by your expectations i went in simply to see matt damon in an action film so my only disappointment was that fact that i kept feeling like something was missing in adapting the story from the book a number of plot lines had to be updated the book is copyright 1980 or removed entirely in order to make it a more modern film my main gripe in the adaptation process marie st jacques franka potente was transformed from a very strong lead female character to a supporting character whose only conceivable reason for being female was to act as a love interest,intelligence
full of spoilers  warning i went into this movie expecting it to be crap if you go in with this attitude you will be pleasantly surprisedmake sure your suspension of disbelief goes into turbo mode when what looks like 45 slugs are excised from just beneath the skin and you will be pleasantly entertained till the awfull stairwell scene when the movie will lose you entirely mercifully close to the end just before the truly nausiating reuniioni didnt mind the jump shots as much as some the euro chic was fun the car chase was brilliant i think anyone who either hated or loved this film has missed the pointbig question  what was the score with the grainyness and blotches on the film  since a couple have commented on it it cant just be the one print i would seriously doubt that the noise  the seething grain and the blotches could be anything other than deliberatewas this movie shot on high end video and those flaws added digitally to give the film a soft 60s feel or am i an idiotis there a good website where technical issues such as this are adressed by the film makers the official website for this film sucks utterly btw,intelligence
the movie was good right up until the moment where spoiler alert stop reading now if youve seen this or dont care regardless continue on matt affleck rides this guy down the center of a looping staircase you know the kind i mean he basically lays across the guys back on his chest and holds on by his collar oh yeah he shoots someone on the way down also now one or two flights maybe but not five or six youve gotta be kidding me and he gets up and walks away with a slight limp not only that the fx in that moment were really bad you could clearly see that it was an insert whatever that moment kinda screwed the movie up for me its a good movie but that scene ugggh my tummy hurts just thinking about it its a shame cause i enjoyed everything else the action the story a bit and the acting franka potente will be my wife eventually and if you are reading this franka email me because i seriously love you rating 12 out of  ps if you think you caught a mistake with the matt affleck thing i hope that you can find comfort in knowing that i feel sorry for you,intelligence

this movie has very good action its thrilling everything is in perfectly done its kinda like james bond matt damon does well playing jason bourne sometimes the movie got a little boring but it got better see it in theaters or when it comes on video and dvd go rent it,intelligence
i just finished reading the book today what an amazing novel chalked full of action smart dialogue and intrigue after finishing it i was wanting to see how the movie matched up boy did it not match upi know that movies never live up to the way the book plays out in your minds but this movie has basically nothing in common with the book aside from the name and a few characters its totally different matt damon does a good job as jason bourne he is believable as the character if only he was given a good script to follow there is plenty of action and the fight scenes are pretty goodi just cant get over how different it is from the book this movie will be good for those who havent read the book it does carry itself well as a above average spy flickso if youve never read the book go see the movie you will be entertained but it wont be something youll remember in a few months those who have read the book steer clear this movie doesnt hold a torch to it,intelligence
this was one of the top three movies entertaining movies ive seen this year  very well cast and directed  i only wish the production made it a three hour instead of a twohour movie so it could have developed the original ludlum story line  if it had it could have been one of the top three movies of all time  hey if doug liman reads this then you should beg the studio for a remake so you can be immortalized too bad that the sequel we all know will come soon has to abandon the richer story line in ludlums bourne series,intelligence
this movie is awesome good plot good actors good action scenes hardcore male movie no bs no sex no gushy love best action movie ive ever seen go see it or if its out of theartres buy it dont waste time and money renting it just buy it,intelligence
spoilerspoilerspoileris a foreign intrigue thriller set in zurich and paris the ciaif theres one thing it does well its cleanup a messhas a problem  ted conklin chris cooper a cia handler in langley has a big mess on his hands its name is jason bourne matt damon  bourne an assassin whos mia in the cia missed his hit on an exiled dictator was wounded and set adrift and has lost his memory ie identity  bourne remembers just enough to be dangerous turns up at the us embassy in zurich and all hell breaks loose  marie franka potente an itinerant german working girl lends him a hand and the chase is on  bourne can neither hide nor rejoin the cia nor can he right his blown assassination attempt  this situation can end in only one way or then again maybe two or three ways is vintage robert ludlum  theres an exotic but not improbable story with fast paced action suspenseful twists and turns unexpected bursts of violence and a hero  best of all youll not have to scratch your head to unravel the plot at the end  mat damon is the real deal as a crafty cia assassin with all the savvy moves and killer instincts among the films highlights is a car chase that would stop traffic pardon the pun and is reminiscent of the french connection 1971 or even bullitt 1968 with steve mcqueen  is one of those rare films with perfect casting  damon an improbable selection can add a page to his resume with a convincing performance replacing tom cruse as an action hero wont be mission impossible for damon  germanborn franka potente adds a realistic touch as a handtomouth youth drifting across europe and always up for a thrill she sprinted onto us art theater screens in run lola run 1999  chris cox a personal favorite is just right as a journeyman cia operative whos in over his head without a lifeline  ludlum who died in 2001 a prolific american writer with over 30 best sellers and legion of fans was apparently not a fan of hollywood with only 23 of his books on film  see this one,intelligence
i wasnt planning on saying anything about this movie but after major disappoinments like minority report and the frustration of wanting to shout at the screen do something during road to perdition easly stands out as the best summer movie this year maybe signs will surpass but doubtfull and f vin disel this was a really enjoyable movie liman handled the action in a very interesting way very enjoyable movie i loved it,intelligence
and a star is bourne  not that he wasnt already a star  but he adds legit action star to his credentials in this piece which is a notch above the postconnery bond films and even some of the connery bond films  it is intelligent and endlessly paranoia and just cause im paranoia doesnt mean people arent out to get me  franka polenta is odd casting here youd think theyd go for a more obvious babe type a la bond girl but she works so well in this film  looks like damon and polenta have a franchise opp here,intelligence
this was a fun summer movie nothing more nothing less matt damon exceeded my expectations for this type of role the chemistry between him and franka potente was good not familiar with her before this movie but liked her presenceespecially liked the cinematographymajor flaw julia stiles role what was the pointoverall i would recommend,intelligence
it wasnt one of those movies thats so bad you want to leave the theater but it wasnt anything special if you wanna kill a few hours watching guys fight and shoot each other its entertaining enough after seeing the movie i read the 1982 novel that it was based on as is often the case the book is much better than the movie the good news is if you have seen the movie it didnt spoil the book the book and the movie are two completely different stories with only the very basic premise in common on the other hand if you liked the book and are expecting to see a movie version of it you will be disappointed they just made a typical hollywood spy thriller with a weak script and gave it the same name as the 1982 novel,intelligence
i happen to be a fan of ludlums is one of few of his books i have not read so far yet this movie pales when compared with say the fugitive matt damon is no harrison ford and his enemies are not half as convincing as tommy lee jones in the fugitive or any other movie hes playing the bad cop franka potente is quite authentically shocked julia styles is  unless she was supposed to play a dumb girl picking up the phone in this movie  in this case very convincing and the hitmen were all sort of zombieish however the car chase was fun and quite credible when you discount the the fact that the fastest way from zurich to paris will not let you see any matterhornlike mountains damonbourne falling down the between the stairs was definitely not neither was the haircut he gave franka ,intelligence
im from australia and the film hasnt opened here yet however i need to stress for those of you who are saying that this is nothing original and to go and see other films instead that this film was first a book that came out in the era in which novels of this calibre were being released by such great authors such as ludlum deighton le carre and forsyth not too many of these books have been made into films which is a shame and garth franklin put what i am saying into greater detail but it needs to be stressed that you have to go into this film and realise that this film was a book before its release and although it may not be true to the book there will be a trilogy hopefully that will be a new series for us bond fans out there to enjoy by the way i thoroughly recommend the book to anyone who loves to read andor loved the film cheers,intelligence
i found the film a good action movie like the character in the film i recovered from amnesia mine was why i stopped reading the book there were too many action fights in the book although they are good in a film it made the book too boring for me also the implausibility of remembering everything except your name i am sure many enron and worldcom former executives will have or have the problem now matt damon and all the bad guys were very good in the film,intelligence
oki had minimal expectations going into andi must say i was not disappointed but rather entertained  its gotsome style the editing is tight but not mtvish the frenchlocations very gritty and realistic and the action is regular kineticand creative   a nice little rental movie or a cheap matineesome weak points  julia stiles who i liked in last dance isutterly wasted here as a glorified phone operator   the subplot ofthe african dictator in exile doesnt really pay off you really dontcare whether he lives or dies  and finally and almost fatally mattdamon is too boyish to be a realistic jason bourne who iexpected to be a bit more worldwearyall that being said i hear there are two sequels in the works  illstill consider catching those particularly if directed by doug limanwho i liked in go,intelligence
is about as action packed suspenseful a thriller as you are going to find and thats rather surprising because the plot is not all that original and not very difficult to figure out even if youve never seen a movie like this beforethe plot has matt damon fished out of the ocean and finding that while he knows how to do all sorts of things including speak a lot of languages hes americanhe just cant remember his name or anything personalthe rest of the tale is the unraveling of his past which turns out to be all about his work as a cia assassin director doug liman does an excellent job with the almost nonstop action which is expertly staged from start to finish  that includes a car chase through downtown paris which puts to shame the one staged in ronin by car chase expert john frankinheimer  limans work is less precise in terms of the direction of actors but then for the most part they dont have all that much to do actingwisedamon is fine as the man without a past  german actress franke potente the redhead from run lola run is even better as the girl who gets involved with him  she is actually given a little room to work and she does well especially in a scene where she witnesses a brutal fight to the death and finds she cannot just shrug it off as one more day in the officesome of the other casting falls a little flat though  chris cooper usually great is somewhat miscast as the head of a cia black ops group the very talented julia stiles is given little to do as a paris cia operativeand looks much too young for the job and clive owen clearly british sort of seems out of place as a cia assassinbut the action moves so fast that you hardly notice and overallthe picture succeeds very welleven though you pretty much know how its going to come out before the first reel is overi recommend the film highlybut one final thought about its timing  makes its debut as america continues to be caught up in the war on terrorism  thats interesting because this film is clearly about the cia which is depicted as a us government agency that assassinates foreign leaders then blames the crimes on others murders innocent civilians and then lies to the american people when its leaders perjure themselves before congressall this at a time when us intelligence agencies are arresting suspected terrorists and holding them incommunicado at times saying it may not even grant them a trial  but we are told trust these government agencies we can believe them  they may have blown chance after chance to head off the 911 attacks they may have muffed countless important cases in the past they may have failed to predict any of the major events they had been looking out for since world war ii but dont worry theyve finally got it all rightsorry the message in the bourne identify rings a lot truer than most of the pronouncements coming from real washington officials about why we shouldnt mind that they are whittling away at the bill of rights robert ludlum may be simply a novelist but john aschcroft is a failed politicianhe was defeated in his bid for reelection to the senate by a dead man and aschcroft is the one i dont trust,intelligence
bourne takes itself too seriously  we have already seen the sum of all fears and we dont need another phoney  even though everyone involved in this film thought it was something special and it isnt it still will work for some friday night entertainment  it wasnt bad it just wasnt the ticket either  id say save it for video  then you wont feel jippedgrade c,intelligence
i really enjoyed this roninesque movie a top government assassin with amnesia trying to figure out who he is the european back drop was perfect for the storyline the elaboration of the primary assassination could have been better explained you piece it together through flashbacks good entertainment jason bourne finds himself changes his course in life and gets the girlfranke potente,intelligence
this movie was fantastic the suspense was awesome the action superb the characters were likable and the plotline interesting matt damon was great and the very talented franka potente was great to see the direction was very welldone and the sound thrilling there are so many other good things about it that id love to say but theres just too much this movie is definitely worth seeing and im going back a second time and getting it on dvd 910  see this movie,intelligence
is a diverting entertainment piece that moves as quickly through the mind as it does across the screen it says little and means less and that arguably is what action pictures are all about good clean violent entertainment with an ostensibly happy ending bourne is mostly comicbook stuff with a modest bite  more a nibble really  and its fine for an early summers family entertainment the night i saw the film there was a young girl maybe age twelve sitting with her parents a few seats away from me at films end i didnt have a sense that she had seen anything terribly inappropriate especially by current dismal standards for one thing there wasnt any sex the one promising clinch in the film between matt damon jason bourne and franka potente marie kreutz quickly faded from view  shades of the 1940s  once the embrace got really close and it was apparent that tongues and other body parts might soon be involved in the only other scene where sex seemed likely damonbourne elects to sleep on the floor rather than share potentekreutzs bed the efficiently homicidal chap is clearly a boy scout under that  well  boyscout exterior and thats important of course children who attend movies like this must be protected from displays of adult sexuality never mind that the set is drenched in blood and littered with bodies at films end hollywood has its valuesalthough i really enjoyed the film i do have a few problems with itthe main problem as i see it is with the depiction of the cia and even its inclusion in the plot it might have been better if bournes controlling organisation had been referred to semianonymously as the agency a ruse that has proven useful in other films of this genre marathon man comes to mind for better or for worse my own bias is for better the cia and its companion agency the fbi are in very bad odour in the wake of their colossal failures leading up to 911 the oncehappy notion that the cia is populated with hugely intelligent and hyperefficient guys and gals who never or almost never make mistakes has taken a welldeserved hit and their reputation is basically in tatters the tragedy of 911 more than suggests the opposite that these two governmental critters are in fact bloated bureaucracies where internal turf battles and selfinterested ladderclimbing are more of a preoccupation than actually protecting the nation and the larger western world from terrorism and other international nastinessand that highlights the inherent problem with films like thanks to a moderately vigilant press and the courage of a few formerly anonymous public servants who miraculously appear to believe that they really are servants of the public most of us have become more than just a little sceptical of the shenanigans of the cia and its fellows with their penchant for covert operations that involve the murder of foreign political leaders they dont like its especially bothersome of course that last years brave and treasured ally is too often the current years loathsome villain in this context its useful to remember that both saddam hussein and osama bin laden were cia darlings before they went bad and forfeited their dubious attraction for the strange group of souls who set and abet foreign policy in washington it was fitting then that bournes cia chief ted conklin chris cooper is so unlikeable and so obviously a villain when he is taken out in one of the final scenes it was no surprise and even pleasing but that didnt succeed in lifting the moral tone of the film certainly nothing like the sheer joy that reverberated through the theatre when dustin hoffman took out the agency bad guy william devane in marathon manfor all of the above cavilling though i have no lingering bad thoughts about it was entertaining and i enjoyed it matt damon continues to elevate his career and his obvious talent combined with refreshingly offbeat looks  faint echoes of a youthful jimmy cagney  should fuel the ascent providing he maintains a reasonable amount of discretion in role selection ben affleck take note and if bournes amazing epiphany in suddenly rejecting violence and deciding to eschew the career of an ultraefficient assassin doesnt really convince thats okay we always knew bourne was really a nice guy under the 9 mm glock a sort of jimmy ryanwill hunting inwaiting franka potente was an interesting choice for the loveinterest role shes a good actress and i look forward to seeing her again i admit however to thinking several times during the film that bourne was a good choice for her major american debut all that running through the streets in run lola run 1999 must have gotten her into terrific shape for the frantic racing around paris and elsewhere one final question though what happened to the julia stiles character did she live did she die why in fact was she in the film in the first place its something of a comedown surely after serious roles in o and the business of strangers to be included in a major film simply as a pretty face,intelligence
unlike many summer films gets the job done indie director doug liman swingers go  makes a highly entertaining and slick action pic that us viewers need to see more of matt damon plays jason bourne cool and collective and the story centers around his state of memory loss as the puzzle is unraveled jason starts to learn his identity the techno beats on the soundtrack provide the appropriate mood for this spy thriller great actions sequences and futuristic camera work make this movie top notch entertainment810,intelligence
yeah it has the pacing of a 007 movie but i like james bond movies  and i bet you secretly do too  willing suspension of belief and all that stuffwhat makes it even better it can be compared to the early spy movies when you actually thought the good guy has a chance to get hurt  heck he does get hurt  the movie doesnt insult your intelligence with a bunch of unbelievable decision making  you know the sort dont into that dark room buffy  the movie sets up the action that follows by allowing the principals to think their way out of a jam not just get lucky  the action by the way is great escapismthe cherry on the top of this confection is the locale  it is nice to see the new europe in a distinctly american movieoverall a good movie that has plenty of eye candy is exciting to watch has actors actually acting and is suitable for anyone over say the age of 14  what is up with the ratings board  not a bad way to accompany popcorn,intelligence
matt damon was surprisingly convincing as jason bourne  an excellent fastpaced adaptation of the ludlum classic  much better than the tv movie chris cooper also shines plus a surprising cameo by julia stiles  great summer entertainment,intelligence
i really enjoyed this fast paced spy thriller  matt damon again gave a believable performance  he is becoming one of my favorite movie actors this story kept you on the edge of your seat and the car chases were exciting and well done  it is my highest recommendation that you go see this nail biter,intelligence
i went to see this movie because it looked like an action flick that might be halfway decent a rare find with action flicks in my mind  i was pleasantly suprised  while i had anticipated that matt damon would make for a lousy action hero i found he pulled it off nicely  the girl from run lola run is great and believable as the heroine  nice to see a movie that doesnt use a hollywood starlet as the leading lady and goes with a great actress instead nonamerican to booti liked everything about this movie  the plot was intriguing the acting was great the action scenes were super one of the best car chase scenes of all time and even the romance was believablei left this movie wanting to read the book by robert ludlumi gave this movie a 9 out of 10,intelligence
remember when matt damon and ben affleck were making films together it doesnt take much of a memory since theyre still at it wasnt it just a couple of weeks ago that the sum of all fears came out cia thriller reluctant spies dead bodies abound although i didnt catch that one fulfilled my minimum daily requirements of espionage intrigue and physicality and for a dad with two teenagers i have a very high threshold there are allot of spaces to be filled in this movie so linear thinkers beware jason bourne matt damon will be your 30 million dollar killing machine without a clear memory of his past or his lifes mission but he has skills and reflexes to make any killing machine proud and money stashed away to give him time to find out if his pursuers let him alone that ismarie kreutz franka potente straddles the line between strong and independent woman and perplexed partner and adventurer although this film has many strong characters ms potente is clearly the highlight watch for several connections between her current character and her former role as lola in run lola runbourne has a weakness that renders him ineffective as an agent and though his boss isnt clear on the specifics he knows hes got to get him in a body bag by sundown bourne isnt going down without a fight and he seems up for anything theyre going to throw at him and that not only goes for secret government agencies but also the more dangerous hollywood studioshow much do you think bmw paid to get an old mini cooper placed as the getaway vehicle if a vintage beat up mini can outpace the french gendarmes just imagine what my new one can do,intelligence
the best action movie in last 3 years since matrix no fantastic jumps almost no stupid rapids there are some holes in plot but they cannot shadow the quality of job done 8 out of 10,intelligence
the film was near perfect  the acting was subtle the action quick and clean and the suspense was gratifying  there are so many good things about this movie but perhaps the best is that it was intelligent  no goofy comic relief no hamfisted political preaching and no silly overthetop superhuman read mission impossible special effects  i have not felt this good about an actionspy thriller since three days of the condor  one more great thing this is a great date movie  there was definite sexual tension between the beautiful leads damon and potente but it was not graphic,intelligence
first it helps that matt damon is one of my favorite actors hes been somewhere near my top five since i first saw him in dogma and after that i discovered that hes a much better actor than that movie allowed him to show hes easy to like in any role and i havent seen a movie yet that hes been in that i havent liked add to that some great performances by chris cooper and julia stiles whose role was not nearly significant enough but enough to lure me into the theatre and i think ive found potentially my favorite realistic action movie of the year assuming nothing better comes along but to the movie i had no idea that it existed until a couple of weeks ago i had no idea that i would like it until a couple days ago and i had no idea that i would see it today until a couple of hours ago but i did and i liked it and now im almost disappointed that i have disliked shelving robert ludlums books for the past few months is a great story one worth seeing several times over and a great movie having said that i may just have to read the book in my opinion is one of the best movies of the year and is easily one of my new favorites assuming that that doesnt change there is a particularly good chance that the dvd will land on my shelf when it is released in my opinion its a great movie  one of the best films of its genre that ive seen in quite a while,intelligence
i had the opportunity to see a test screening of far back in the summer of 2001 overall i didnt feel that the film merited any special sort of awards but it is a good film none the lessstarring matt damon and directed by doug liman go swingers the film is about a spy who seems to be suffering from amnesia meanwhile assassins are sent to stop him before he remembers whatever information he was supposed to have forgotten the film is based on a book by robert ludlumin comparison to this summers other big spy thriller the sum of all fears this is filled with my action rather then political drama not that political drama is a bad thing but that sort of thing doesnt appeal to all crowds if you like the james bondie type spy thrillers is your game overall a good summer action movie check it outrating 8 out of 10,intelligence
apparently no one including most or all of the critics picked up on the flaw which renders the whole picture ridiculous  any idiot amnesia or not with a room temperature iq would have done two things almost immediately after a bank security man yells you with the red bag stop  does this trained spook get rid of the bright red bag from which he can be spotted from a satellite nooooo  much later in the picture he stashes it in a locker worse yet with wanted posters all over the place with his picture on them does he try to alter his appearance  no again  no hat no sunglasses no beard or mustache nada  he tries to change the girls appearance by chopping off her hair which doesnt change her enough at all but why bother  he is obviously shaving every day so he will continue to look exactly like matt damon whom they paid all that money to play the part  he should be minimally smart and change his appearance when everyone in the world seems to want to kill him  this lapse is so ridiculous i spent the entire time yelling at the screen and not enjoying whatever virtues the film did have  shame on the producers for allowing this idiocy,intelligence
as a frequent moviegoer ive found that movies have a lot of predictability this really is not a problem for most genres except for suspensethrillers such as i bought my ticket because im a fan of matt damons work i had no great expectations but boy was i wrong not only was damon great as the amnesiac jason bourne but the entire cast along with the unusual choice of a director and the location shots made this one of the best spy movies ive seen in a long time,intelligence
the acting was great the car chase was fantastic matt damon pulled off the character as jason bourne very well im not sure that anyone else would have been as good in that role it was not too unrealistic i definitely loved this movie and would recommend to anyone,intelligence
the movie kicks off in a bang and remains very intense for the entire duration matt damon makes an excellent performance and the directing work is outstanding overall a solid spy thriller with a nice new touch as a citizen of zurich the only time the film upset me is when the old cliche of numbered accounts on a swiss bank was used again and the zurich setting was obviously not zurich but apparently somewhere in paris well why not spend a little more money and at least set the cliche where its supposed to happen ,intelligence
i just got a chance to see today  at first i didnt think the movie would be any good consider im not a big fan of matt damon but there were some movies i liked or loved saving private ryan oceans eleven good will hunting any movies by kevin smith just to name a few and there may have been 1 or 2 movies that i didnt liked the talented mr ripley but after seeing this movie well heres what i got to sayi just thought the movie was pretty good  there were some great scenes  i like the setting of the movie  matt did a good job playing the main character jason bourne  i dont know what else to say  its not one the best movies out there but its still good  if youre a big fan of matt damon then check out  im sure you wont be disappointeda 1113 12 out of  stars,intelligence
i loved the book and i loved the movie  never thought i would find matt damon sexy but he did it for me in that movie  fraka potente is excellent the locations are great and the action is nonstop  definetaly worth the money,intelligence
one of damons better efforts lately and the potente actress is just great i need to go check out her lola run movie  havent seen that one yet good casting interesting plot slightly far fetched in places but overall entertaining thrilling and plenty of curves to keep you in suspense  one of the better chase scenes in a minicompact ever filmed as well  two thumbs up,intelligence
i really loved this flick  i have always thought matt damon was talented hello mr ripleybut in this film he really shows the measure of his talent  both emotionally and physically  to sum up this in 2 words wicked awesome  it is a must see for men and women alike  franka was so great she is so subtle but so right on the money with her performance  i am a true matt damon fan now  it really kept me on the edge of my seat  and the touch of romance hit the spot   i havent seen a movie in a long time that wasnt a waste of 8 bucks but this movie is worth seeing a 2nd time for sure  i can always tell a movie is great by the aftertaste for lack of a better word  i left the theater with a feeling of awe  amazement leaving a movie nowadays feeling anything at all is amazing in and of itself but this movie leaves me with feelings that reinforce my desire to be an actor,intelligence
given the bounty of production troubles with this thing  reshoots rewrites reported directorstudio spats  who would have guessed it but lo and behold robert ludlums amnesiac assassin is eh hm born again casting damon proves a stroke of genius just like bourne himself were downright stunned to see this slight cerebral guys smooth killer moves ditto for work from liman whose swingers and go only hinted at what he can do with a camera believe all those comparisons to the french connection the carchase sequence here is nearly as crafty this is a thinking mans and womans delight too watching you just keep asking just how is bourne gonna get out of this pickle leaving the theater another question when are they gonna give us a sequel,intelligence
spoilers hereinaside from being a spectacularly average movie there were a few parts of the movie that gave me pause  for instance matt damon went to the train station to hide his bag launching the big chase scene but it appears throughout the rest of the movie  i cant imagine mr superspy just went back and got it from a place the cops would be watchingalso the whole what kind of person has two bullet holes in his back microfilm implanted in his hip a secret swiss bank account with fake passports and bundles of cash and knows tons of cool secret agent stuff brooding in the first third of the movie made me feel that maybe ol jason bourne wasnt the sharpest knife in the drawer i ask you what kind of person  um gee jason i dont know  an english professor  a dairy farmer   what kind of short list did you come up with  i think im in shipping  and then the girlfriend was shocked shocked to learn that hes a government assassin  what did you think honey after he disarmed the man with the machine gun and had a kungfu duel with him and then knew how to wipe down the car they just eluded the police ini did dig how matt damon was initially surprised at his skills looking incredulous after his instincts kicked and he hospitalized two cops and after the big car chase  nice touchend spoilersoverall id say 3 out of 5 for some nice acting some nice writing and going to the matinee did get me out of the heat for a couple of hours but nothing spectacular,intelligence
spy movies are probably the most tired out genre in action flicks theyve been done to death and yet studios still think theyll be able to get it right by copying the old movies and reviving themthis movie starts off okay but it loses its momentum the longer it runs the first problem with this movie is the story once you piece together that jasons a cia assassin the movie just turns into an action set piece flickthe chase is on and every fifteen minutes you get some action but the in between scenes are what should make the movie count but unfortunately theyre just boringjasons character has nothing much to say except who am i and his female partner marie is a little too easily wooed by a killerthere is no mystery to the movie which wouldve actually helped the villains arent interesting at all you get a vastly under used clive owen and always playing an asshole chris cooper thats about itthere isnt much suspense in the film and the only memorable parts are a car chase in paris and when jason uses a dead body to break his fall of about 4 stories even after the fall i at least wanted to see some plausible injury but nooverall this movie was forgettable id wait for it to come on hbo i love popcorn flicks as much as the next guy but this movie didnt have much going for it,intelligence
why arent more movies this good get solid actors matt damon franka potente clive owen chris cooper julia stiles etc hey nobody that sucks get a good story dont bore people it doesnt seem that hard does itsolid action but not just the fx thats the easy part but characters that think about what they are doing not making the dumb mistakes because the story needs them totrust me if no one sees this movie it will become a cult classic,intelligence
sequel then original then book that is the recommended order of exposure for any film and this is no exception ive never read the book but did see the original movie which was decent but not spectacular when i heard about the remake and then saw previews i was pretty excited about seeing it it looked as though they had significantly improved the action sequences something that i felt the original film was lackingi was right about the action sequences the fights are well choreographed and the chase scenedespite the obvious tiein with the new mini campaign in the uswas very well done had they just made these changes i think the film would have been truly excellentbut for reasons unclear perhaps to draw a wider audience or for easier international distribution they dumbed down the plot significantly the characters are made unidimensional or nondimensional as in the absolute waste they made of julia stiless involvement and the changes to the plot move it from ran to mission impossible both required suspension of disbelief but the latter also required suspension of thinking why is it that hollywood refuses to make intelligent action flicksthis one is worth a rental if only for the action sequences if you never read the book or saw the original take a chance on it i guess 510,intelligence
a slick very watchable package where the elements are blended very well fine action sequences wellcomposed scenes and sets excellent pacing commendable camera work even during dialogue scenes entertaining score decent acting and an engaging plot that doesnt leave you wondering nor overtly show its hand  plus they made sure it wasnt a total guy flick  the bg is limited there are no bimbo babes hot rod wagons or farout techno tools and no overthetop fight sequences,intelligence
reminders me of the matrix excellent fight scenes the greatest car chase of all time and a beautiful woman what more could a guy ask for the story is very good with only a couple of bad dialog sequences at the end of car chase and the cinematography is great,intelligence
and i went into the movie already expecting good things from the director of swingers and go  liman did not disappoint with this spyaction movie that will hopefully lead to 2 sequels  this movie is by far the best movie of its genre that has come out in the last few years  no recent james bond movie compares and neither do any of the tom clancyjack ryan movies  matt damon is a believable action star he definitely surprised me since i had my doubts before watching the movie especially with the martial arts  this movie actually includes one of the best martial arts fights i have seen in awhile and i have seen quite a few  it is one of those few action movies that you actually care about the characters and there is even well written dialogue gasp witty dialogue in an action movie  how could that be this is a totally different movie from limans previous efforts but this just shows that he is definitely an up and coming director that knows how to make small independent movies as well as big boxoffice action movies  if you are skeptical of matt damon dont be  he was actually very good and it helps that he is a much better actor than say his friend benfranka was also extremely good and i have not had the chance to see her in run lola run  actually all the supporting characters were very well done check this movie out it is definitely worth the time and money 12 out of  but once i see it again it may warrant 4 stars,intelligence
i went to this movie with high hopes  im a fan of the book and thought matt damon was the perfect person to portray the screen version of jason bourne  on this i felt that i was completely justified and the action sequences were great  i knew the movie would deviate from the book and i was okay with that until the very end of the movie  i left unsatisfied because there was a huge hole left  my husband who has never read the book also enjoyed the movie but left unfulfilled due to the hole left in the movie  i would recommend perhaps watching this movie in the cheap theater or waiting until video rather than spending the amount of money it costs to see it in the theater,intelligence
matt damon is not a great actor in the same way that harrison ford is not but he knows the technical aspects of his craft well enough to seamlessly blend into almost any role he chooses i would have liked to have cared a bit more about his character in this movie it someone must have decided that his situation has made the character somewhat aloofthe plot is a bit dated the bad old cia has a rogue unit that is out of control and will do anything and everything necessary to clean up after a mistake is made chris cooper does his usual fine job here in spite of being a little miscast as the leader of this unit he is a salt of the earth character and just not the wizbang bad guy typecasting franka potente caused her character to be german fine i want to see a lot more of her she has an honesty in looks and mannerisms that almost i said almost stole a few scenes from mr damon poor julia stiles was wasted here but im sure her turn will come somebody had to play this minor but pivotal role and im glad she was the onethe location cinematography was very easy on the eyes i would like to know how they shot in some of the more cramped but colorful spots it should at least make you want to see paris and that alone is a public serviceyou will have to suspend reality several times to stay in the moment but if you can do this you will be rewarded with lots of good action,intelligence
if you love spy type movies this one was great  i thought it was better than either of the mission impossible movies or others like it  the acting directing camara work music especially liked the music were all great  my husband and i were on the edge of our seats the whole time  a definate must see movie,intelligence
finally a spy movie that does it right matt damon really pulls it off playing jason bourne a operative working for the us government who is found floating in the sea off marseille with a couple bullets in his back he has amnesia but he discovers he has many skills and knowledge of how to do many things that seem to be instinctual but he cant remember who he is or where is from he is nursed back to health by the captain of the boat and that is where the real fun begins damon plays this role very well and the girl who gives him a ride to paris and eventually becomes much more than a chauffer franka potente with looks reminiscent of a more mature claire danes and a sexy german accent every time she says shiest i fall in love again chris cooper plays damons boss who is now trying to take him out chris you may remember as the former marine neighbor in american beauty he plays his role very well and his final scene is both ironic and funny chris is very believable and a very powerful actor brian cox plays the cia chief who seems to not know what is going on but there is more to him than meets the eye julia styles is wasted talent in this movie as the operative who runs a safe house in parisoverall this is a good return to the old james bond type movie without all the witty comments gratuitous sex and gadgets bourne is a great spy movie hopefully they will make the other two books into the series into movies too with damon i hope cause he did an excellent job havent seen a movie this good in a while 8510,intelligence
i was pleasantly surprised at matt damons performance as an action hero  though he sports a very young innocent face he was portraying a human lethal weapon of sorts  it was at first confusing and doubtful but i found myself enjoying his performance more and more as the movie continued  frankas performance was quite good though a story line where someone falls so hard for someone they not only just met but who is a killer seemed a bit much  there didnt seem to be enough time to really explain all parts of the story and i was confused at times  as it started concentrating more and more on bournes fight for his memory and life i started to really believe him as a lethally trained spy   i would like to see it again to watch the great action sequences as well as understand more of the plot line it was not profound but pure entertainment  found myself liking matt damon more than before i recommend it for the action scenes and mystery aspects  always been a sucker for a good mystery   watching damons performance was plus,intelligence
i saw the 1030 pm show of on the saturday night after it opened and i must say i was very impressed  the movie grabs your attention from the beginning and doesnt let go until you see the credits no bad press from yours truly  matt damon despite his hearthrob image plays the amnesiac spy perfectly  he has the confused expression down and when he fights you get the feeling hes been doing it for years obviously the use of cut shots and stunt doubles greatly increases the believability of damons physical prowess  nonetheless damon establishes himself as a true physical and mental actor for the first time  and as for franka potente she shines  insanely sexy and intricate she pulls off a performance that just falls short of run lola run  the action sequences in the movie arent too unique but they are well done  the fighting is enthralling as it is violent and lacks the obvious choreography of a wire fight  the car chase through the streets of paris looks way too much like the thrilling car chase from ronin but it still delivers a large punch to the middle of the movie  one of the things that makes this movie so captivating is the onscreen chemistry of damon and potente  you can feel their connection throughout the entire movie and their near topless makeout scene will make you turn your head to your signifigant other with a knowing look in your eyeall in all i think it might become the basis for spythrilleraction movies for a while  it ranks in the company of the first brosnan bond goldeneye and robert de niros international thriller ronin,intelligence
if you have seen and like la femme nikita and the various bond flicks then you will like bi  it is sort of a male version of la femme nikita the original french version is better than the usa version with bri fonda good action scenes that dont really jump the shark until the very end good thing they didnt give franka potente any real lines and character to work with otherwise she would spin circles around the everflat matt damon   if you read my reviews you know i rate movies into three bins mustsee in theatre ok for a video rental waste of time    bi rates okvideo  but i didnt feel badly having spent 10 to see it in the theatre   610,intelligence
take it for what its worth and enjoy just because you have seen similar before doesnt make it wrong good action great car chase through paris and real locales make this worth the price of admission you will not fall asleep,intelligence
saying this movie was based on robert ludlums book gives mr ludlum way too much credit for this story  the first 30 seconds of the film roughly follows the book and then the book goes off on a completely different storyin all honesty i think that bourne is the only character in this movie who is also in the book  others such as the doctor who works on him and the girl who ends up accompanying him are sort of in the book but they have been changed almost beyond all recognition  even bourne himself has been changed drastically  im amazed that they spent the money for the rights to this book and then rendered it unrecognizable by stripping out 99 of the plot and just keeping a name or two  the book was originally released in the mid70s so its not like they were paying for name recognition such as a tom clancy novelall that aside the movie isnt too bad  its directed and acted fairly well in spite of a rather formulaic script,intelligence
was an average movie it really wanted to be a roninstyle movie or something perhaps from luc besson but the feeling wasnt quite there its quite obvious that the makers of the film were going for the exotic flavour as we are shown shots of european landmarks many times throughout the moviematt damon was great as usual and franka potente was also very good its funny again we can see that she was cast for that european touch my problem with the movie however was that it couldnt plot enough there werent enough tense moments for damons character there wasnt enough done on the amnesia subplot in the end the movie seemed like a movie to show friends to prove you have a wicked home theater system instead of the intellectual and twisty spy thriller it could have been another thingthe film really never stops moving especially the camera work in the cia shotsmaybe they shouldve stopped and added more mystique intrigue suspense thats what spy thrillers are aboutand this film didnt have too much spy going for itstill i wasnt bored watching it and there are a whole bunch of movies that are gonna be coming out that are a lot worse blue crush anyone,intelligence
was an exciting and thrilling movie matt damon did a very good job playing the amnesiastricken character the movie had great action sequences in it and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone i was never bored and i was always wondering what might happen next,intelligence
is about a government agent gone wrong after he was thrown off of a boat and began to suffer from amnesia its kind of like a james bond movie only there is no back up and everyones against him the film is set mostly in paris where the address in a safe deposit box from zurich is through out i had trouble spotting a scene that didnt have a gun involved at some point or there wasnt some poor guy have the st kicked out of him as jason bourne matt damon questioned him in order to get some idea of who he was and why he was thrown in to the ocean and shot in the back as he gets his address nine passports and ton of cash from the safe deposit box he meets a woman called marie krentz franka potente who also is on run as damon pays her 10000  for a ride to paris where he gives her another ten grand the film over all was very entertaining but didnt have the most original story despite the odd  bit of boredom i liked the movie and probably would recommend it to people who enjoy watching  people running around with guns and i will give it three and a half stars out of five because after all it was entertaining,intelligence
born winner perfect mix of modern pacing  70s spythrillerabsolutely nothing unneeded in this movie they have achieved something here not seen in a movie in many many years    the viewer actually cares about every character no matter how minor plus each and every actors performance is superb too  outstanding,intelligence
the first five minutes of the film grasp your attention excellently jason bourne is found floating in the atlantic ocean with a two bullets in his back and a laser projected address imbedded into his hip he doesnt know his name and he practically cant recall anything prior to his findings as he makes his way to a bank in zurich it seems that he is wanted for something law enforcement security guards even special forces are chasing him the film has you constantly asking the question why are they after himmatt damon although slightly unconvincing in the beginning and franka potente make a good bonnie  clydeineurope duo where both characters feel devoted to the situation for a while chris cooper always plays a good antagonist however they should have casted a less recognizable face for the role played by julia stilesall the pieces come together and build up to give forth a very weak ending the what happened to bourne and who was he mystery turned out to be quite predictable and the happy ending felt out of place from the rest of the filmsee the film if you would like to see matt in action complete with fight sequences and plentyocar chases but dont expect much more,intelligence

i saw this film last night and thought it was great it was refreshing to see franka potente in an american film she is a great actress and fits her role well the problem i had with the film was that it was a carbon copy of the long kiss goodnight but with the genders reversed matt damon geena davis and franka potente samuel jacksonmy rating 85 10,intelligence
 at the movies directed by doug liman  written by tony gilroy adapted from the novel of the same name by robert ludlum starring matt damon and franka potente support from chris cooperjason bourne damon is pulled out of the mediterranean by fishermen who at first think him dead but he revives and one of the fishermen who apparently practices surgery as a hobby digs two bullets out of his back and a small capsule out of his hip the capsule contains the access number of a swiss bank account having been deposited by the fishermen on the marseilles waterfront bourne heads for switzerland and the numbered account he has lost his memory although he finds he knows english french and german and in an early runin with two zurich cops who are hassling him as a homeless person he discovers he is exceedingly proficient in martial arts as well the next day he goes to the bank signs in to the account and finds in the safe deposit box numerous passports in his and others names all bearing his picture also there are substantial sums of money in various currencies as well as a gun he leaves the gun and takes the rest in a red bank bag his movements are reported back to a cia operations chief cooper in langley who is reeling from bournes failure to assassinate an african leader adewale akinnuoyeagbaje who was powerful as simon adebisi in the tv series oz  fearing that bourne has at the very least compromised the covert opand may even have turned renegadehe orders bourne killed seeking his identity and suspicious of what his past must have been bourne goes to the us consulate where he finds himself pursued by marine guards escaping the consulate he meets up with a vagabond young woman marie kreutz potente and offers her 20000 to drive him to paris where one of his aliases a mr kane has an apartment there he finds himself the target of assassins he doesnt know who is after him or why but ironically the skills he has learned in that very life that now demands his demise are all that keep him going that and maries little red carthis one is a boys adventure fantasy with archetypal subtext nearly all the physical action is of the dont try this at home variety but it is for the most part very well done almost to the point of being believable given that one goes into this genre willing to suspend a whole lot of disbelief the action is certainly acceptable all except for one five or six story plunge down a stairwell which one might accept only in a superhero movie martial arts and car chases are not among my favorite story elements but liman gives us only one maybe two encounters that shout obligatory martial arts ballet others of his fights are quick and to the point the way serious martial arts fighting would be in real lifeas for car chases although i am no connoisseur ive always thought the carchasestrain sequence in the french connection to be the best chase ive ever seen id say that liman equals that masterpiece when he has the parisian gendarmes chase bourne and marie through the streets of paris in their little red car i find damon convincing as an action hero and potentes character exudes the aura of a sidestreet bathed in shadows and mist which the pursued hero can duck into for respite i love the way she lets the action come to her and then responds in a spontaneous and wholly believable manner that scarcely requires words their relationship is chaste they share a slightly awkward hug and kiss at one point would one wish for more chemistry between them well bourne does have a few things on his mind which are a bit more demanding of his attention than a sexual romp i guess what i would have liked is for marie to have mothered him and for bourne to have responded to her with more vulnerability i know that he has had the vulnerability all but trained out of him and he cant afford to let his guard down but i would have wished for some embrace of genuine respite in which he accepts and succumbs to his need for her to hold him and make it all better not to get too oedipal about it but bourne has been reborn having been all but dead and then passing through a symbolic watery rebirth by which he has shed his past and has a chance to follow his better instinctsonce he discovers what they are for they can only be determined in contrast with what he once was and marie does have an accepting protective attitude toward him which under more favorable circumstances could blossom into the love of a lover for lovers at their best mother each other as welli wish liman had brought out that aspect of their relationship more expanding the storys human dimension but even as it is he respects the reality of his characters and situations more than one finds in most actionadventure movies and he handles them skillfully we attended a sunday matinee that had very few and scattered empty seats the audience responded enthusiastically and there was even a humorous scene which inspired communal laughter i liked the picture and recommend it martial arts and all,intelligence
those kids from good will hunting are really growing up  now that they have grown up they want to go from the cerebral to the action oriented in one bound  right now you could go to the theater and find  ben affleck playing a cia analyst in the sum of all fears or you could check out the adaptation of robert ludlums with matt damon as the lead  i cant speak for the latter but you might want to wait and rent this one ,intelligence
this thriller based on the book by robert ludlam and the tv movie starring richard chamberlain features matt damon as an amnesiac who cant figure out why everyone wants to kill him or why he is so good at killing others the story is involving and moves along at a nice clip the supporting cast featuring chris cooper as a cia agent and franka potente as the love interest is  good though julia stiles usualy an effective young actress weirdly turns up in a minor role damon is good for the most part though he is never entirely believable in this role still that doesnt stop the film from being very entertaining and action packed grade b,intelligence
ive been waiting for this movie since i heard of its production  ive felt matt damon has wasted his talents since his unforgettable performance in good will hunting  after seeing mr affleck in sum of all fears i did not know what to expect from matt damon  well my friends you will believe that matt damon is jason bourne  i have read the triology a few times and the movie does itself against it there are a few acceptable modifications that you seem to forget since youre on the edge of your seat anticipating the next car chase or fight scene  this movie is 2 hours long and the best money ive spent on a movie in a long time  you have the action you have a compassionate love story  there is unbelievable suspense  you will admire some of the characters and hate others but you will always find yourself supporting matt damon as jason bourne  you must see this movie,intelligence
i have to say i enjoyed this movie more than i thought i would  not the most original storyline but very good performances great action sequences great locationsscenery and nice cinematography  admittedly julia stiles is somewhat wasted in her role maybe not the best use of the budget but that is not my concern but its not like having a nobody in the role would have improved the picture or anything  i do wonder why they decided to film the last book in the series  i think they missed the opportunity to start a series of bourne movies based on the ludlum novels  overall worth the price of admission810,intelligence
having just seen the hideous the sum of all fears i went to see with great trepidation  wonderful  another cliched spy film designed to make ones eyes roll back into their skull because of utter disbelief and boredomhow wrong i wasdoug liman should have been my tipoff  the indie auteur of films like swingers and go has always been original and never dull  and while eyebrows may be raised at the choice to have him helm a bigbudget action film dont worry  turns out hes the perfect choice to breathe some muchneeded life into the increasingly stale spook genrematt damon stoic resolute in a firstever true action role plays jason bourneor does he  the man suffers from amnesia after being shot and nearly drowned in the mediterranean  as events unfold we learn that whoever he is he has stashed an incredible amount of domestic and foreign currency in a swiss bank  along with numerous passports all bearing his photo and different aliases  and as it turns out a gunbefore you know it things start to get weird  hes being shot at for one and although he doesnt remember who he is he seems to be awfully good at for example scoping out a diner i can tell you that man at the counter is 215 lbs and can take care of himselfhow do i know all this or taking out one two three men with guns in licketysplit speedas damon slowly unravels the mystery of who he is using skills hes not even really aware that he possesses important plot points are also revealed none of which will be told here  suffice to say that the race is on and limon stages it handsomely  the action set pieces are thrilling precisely because of their fullthrottle no bs approach  for their brevity they hit hard no unnecessary pyrotechnics here which makes them all the more engagingthe supporting cast is also better than it has any right to be  run lola runs franke potente plays the girl who helps damon and she portrays just the right amount of bravery fear and uncertainty about the situation and the mysterious guy shes tagging along with  the reliable chris cooper is damons nemesis at the cia and his hangdog look is just right for the wornout lifelong agent who knows that his job and life are at stake in the catandmouse game hes playingis fun smart and is the coolest action film so far this year,intelligence
the action is so constant and so welldone and the two leads so likable that you dont really notice that the story isnt really going anywhere  i enjoyed every minute  a review i read said that it was a pleasant change of place to have a male lead in an action movie who wasnt slick clever and totally sexy and a female lead along the same lines  i definitely agree theres one whale of a car chase scene thrown in for good measure too,intelligence
2002 12 matt damon franka potente chris cooper brian cox clive owen julia stiles adewale akinnuoyeagbaje  atypical adaptation of robert ludlums espionage thriller with damon as the amnesiac cia op hitman trying to place the pieces of his jigsawed mind into place while thwarting his employers attempt to take him down and running thru europe with reluctant babe potente as his only ally  damon isnt bad as the conflicted yet coolasacucumber hero with issues and mixes it up in his rustles with bad guys but the third act suffers greatly largely to tony gilroy and w blake herrons uneven screenplay despite the unlikely direction of indie phenom doug liman skillfully blending the adrenaline pumped stunts ie a hairraising car chase thru paris and the confused protagonists qualms of being a lethal weapon,intelligence
will probably be the best action film of the year there is no cgi fx no science fiction elements but enough butt kicking action to spare  for years i have been saying it is impossible to make a serious pg13 action movie but has proven me wrong has the privilege of having a surprisingly excellent matt damon and a classy director doug liman  see because the action genre is rebourne with the film,intelligence
the action sequences were great the story based on the novel obviously was fabulous and the acting tied in perfectly with everything  for those that enjoy romance the chemistry is also totally apparent between the two main leads  action and subtle romance come together perfectly  this film keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time  its a perfect example of what one means when categorizing a suspense film  definitely a great date movie in a word brilliant,intelligence
i was disappointed in the deviations from the book  about five or six things were similar  the name of the bank bournes name maries first name paris zurich amnesia  thats pretty much it  no mention of a head wound his past medusaor carlos  decent for entertainment purposes but nothing that i would buy for my personal collection,intelligence
bourne identity    actionadventure matt damon franka potente clive owenjason bourne cant remember anything prior to two weeks ago when he was pulled out of the sea by a fishing trawler but the cia remembers him  and wants him dead why is it always the cia bourne is reminiscent of european secret agent films of the 1960s except this is better done matt damon does a fine job in the lead role good performances all around fistfights gunfire and a long car chase,intelligence
what if you woke up one day and you couldnt remember a thing about yourself you dont know your name or your profession well thats what matt damon in this movie tries to figure out why he has such good fighting skills and doesnt know why he notices things to well its almost like he was trained too and who is trying to kill him and who is he all together a good spy movie that keeps you grabbing on the edge of your seat matt damon gives a great performance so does chris cooper and franka potenta great action and great emotion you wont be dissapointed,intelligence
i saw this at a prescreening this evening with quite an audience this movie moves matt damon up to the big league he gave a great performance that had the entire theater jumping from surprise events and applauding many scenes before the movie even ended and rather than repeat many names already mentioned in other comments i would like to say everyone did a great job with their parts and what a great choice of franka potente as his lady on the run with him remember her great movie run lola run one of the things i liked best was the incredible sound track and score as well as excellent photography to match the events everyone in my group loved the movie and many of us can hardly wait to get the dvd version for our home theaters this will be a must own movie for my collection 9 out of 10 go see this one for sure,intelligence
i was recently asked to attend a screening of and i said sure why not i mean ive read the book a lot and i enjoyed the heck out of it and the other ones so when i came out of the screening i was real happy i saw it my review starts herefollows the story by robert ludlum and the plot follows meet jason bourne he has amnesia and the only thing he can remember is waking up on the shore of the mediterranean sea a few evidences of what has happened to him that he does not remember like a bank account of millions of dollars but the things that he doesnt know is the things that may lead him without a future the rest of the movie is an actionpacked movie with great acting and great directingmatt damon gives a very credible performance as jason bourne and i enjoyed him all the way throughout the movie franka potenta does good as what she has to do but her accent seems to change a lot chris cooper is really cool in this one and i liked him a lot here costarring in this are a few big named stars like julia stiles and brian cox doug liman directed himself a true gem of a movie here  he definitely proved that he is a great director the movie was not filmed in a trilogy but the books are in one i really cant wait for the sequels to comeoverall the movie is excellent on many levels and this could very well be ablockbuster of the summer i recommend this to those who have read the book and just everyone rating big 10 out of 10,intelligence
another entry in the spy fairyland movies  where the cia is seen as the wizard of oz these days  i cannot believe there is yet another completely implausible james bondish feature like this  where sum of all fears bathes the viewer with a little bit more realistic approach to the spy world  we cannot savour the adrenaline rush of the action  if we dont believe the peril of its stars  damon is just too darn good  and the rest of the bad guys are just too darn dumb  the only fresh approach to the formula is the bladerunneresque portrayal of the superhumans that are the assassins  my biggest beef though is the tv ads boasting a car chase better than the french connection  or something like that  much better work was done with the similarly french based ronin  and willaim friedkin already did the drivingagainstonewaytraffic stunt in to live and die in la way back in 1985a good job by the director in getting the paranoia under your skin and a smart job by both damon and potente in trying not to fall into the cliche traps too ofteni give this a 6 out of 10,intelligence
exciting and grimly real as the film seems in comparison to the punincheek james bond films this film ultimately defeats its own reality sort of a redo of tom cruise first mission impossible movie but with overthetop violence and plot inconsistencies in the plotoriented spy genre inconsistency is rather unforgivable why is bourne being hunted down by his boss who admits hes a 30 million weapon for that price tvs old cyborg the 6 million man is looking pretty affordable why is prince scoobydo assassinated when bournes boss admits this will implicate the usa since the prince already made public the first attempt wouldnt airport metal detectors be set off by bournes bank account bullet why surgically put it in his body when its a visible lump and why does he even need it when he memorizes everything  in case he gets amnesia the same question applies to for his fellow spy who unaccountably committs suicide  another 30 million lost who keeps bournes photo when he should have destroyed it and if bourne is a walking weapon would anyone really trust living with him if he retired would you trust your child with him mighten he even suffer some posttrauma like a war vetlike most contemporary action films the director substitutes style for reality using a handheld camera and rapid edits in dull scenes to create false excitement flashing bright lights or icons at the camera when switching scenes an unbelievable carchase that noone sweats during or the ridiculously unending loud pow fist fights on the positive side in contrast this modern style makes older spy films like ipcress file or eiger sanction look even better think ill go rent them,intelligence
contains spoilersi must admit going into i had misgivings about matt damon inhabiting the role of a superspy but less than a half hour into the film my fears were allayed  damon has a fine presence as our amnesiac hero jason bourne and creates genuine chemistry with his lovely costar franka potente  there is also a solid supporting cast containing some of our best character actors including chris cooper and brian coxwhat does not work in this film is babyfaced julia stiles as another operativea communications expertbut her role is so thin and undeveloped that shes little more than a glorified telephone operator  the pacing also seemed a bit tepid at times and there are many familiar spy thriller elements rogue cia operatives swiss bank accounts inept assassinsbut in the end is intelligent and involving  there is a tense car chase which reminded me of another underrated film john frankenheimers ronin as well as several other moments of suspense and intrigue  the plot is complex without being confusing but in the end its damon makes the film flyrating 710,intelligence
finally    a thriller that actually thrills  everyone i spoke to before seeing it expected matt damon to wash out as jason bourne  too young lacks a debonair quality and doesnt have sean connerys style  not only does damon deliver the goods his chemistry with franka potente marie will make her a hot us commodity to follow her impressive european credentials chris cooper shines  a superb character actor always  its expertly written with sharp repartee and clever dialog  if theres something not to like itll take another viewing or two to discover it  orlandos incredible hulk roller coaster was the last entertainment vehicle to deliver this afternoons thrill quotient  grab a date and see it now  now i say    10,intelligence
we enjoyed the movie  it wasnt a big thinking piece but it moved well im looking forward to reading the books now since im sure a lot of backplot was taken out  matt damon was very a very sympathetic character even when he was beating on people  thats an accomplishment  and it was nice to see the female lead not being an unlikely glamour gal  she looked and acted like a regular person being confronted by irregular circumstances,intelligence
i am a fan of spy thrillers and mystery genre in general  however i am always wary of hollywood cliche movies that leave you unsatisfied if not aggravated  this film is a refreshing and enjoyable exception  the cast is picked masterfully and plays great together  strong performances from matt damon and franka potente leave you breathless  what i was on a look out for is a shallow dialogue thinking the movie will focus primarily on action scenes and chase sequences  i was pleasantly surprised by the delicate balance of both  you do have moments where you wonder if the script could have been improved a little bit because of the improbability of events i am talking about the obvious stupidity of certain agents that chase jason and gaps and holes in cia surveillance in general  you have numerous questions and concerns as to could that really have happened but once you get over that little obstacle be prepared to be entertained  go see it in the theaters,intelligence
this movie is super intense  the plot line is great  the action scenes are pretty awesome  when he goes after the sniper outside the house and the little car chase and his stunt with the deadman at the end down the stairs wow  this whole movie is just intense and awesome because of it,intelligence
ive read other reviewers comments cliched and such but this is a much better action spy thriller than the sum of all fears or even bad company and certainly a much better movie than changing lanes  true there are shades of 39 steps and countless other spy thrillers but this one grabs your attention and takes you for a fast ride  there are some spooky moments in the movie and a great car chase the acting is also very good  this is a much better version of the robert ludlum novel than the old madefortelevision one that came out in 1988 when i saw the sum of all fears i felt cheated  i came out of this movie thinking i had got my moneys worth,intelligence

matt damon stars in this actionpacked film of man who is pulled out of the mediteranian sea by a fishing boat and has no recollection of who he is or how he got in his predicament in his hip is found a device with an account number from a bank in switzerland the man is now on a search for his true identity and finds out more than he wanted to know i found this movie to be just spectacular i was upset when they finally made me leave the theatre i wanted more im a big fan of movies involving spies and intrigue so when i saw the preview i had to check this one out before the movie started i was pleased to see a preview for reign of fire which i plan to see this weekend the preview was awesome and definitely prepared me for action which i was wanting to see in the back of my head i was doubting my reason for coming to see it it is a movie with matt damon who i only liked in dogma but my fear of it being something like a spy movie for teenyboppers was extinguished this movie was awesome it was a film i could watch over and over again the action was incredible matt damon kicked ass and i dont even like him the chase scene with the minicoop was pretty inventive i would have never thought one could race one doug liman used his cast and his locations very well he showed paris as paris by not putting the eifel tower in every shot actually i barely remember it being in there at all matt damon was perfect in this role franka potente seemed a little static to mebut im used to seeing her in run lola run chris cooper was excellent as the villian so to say with his brass americanstyle gungho attitude which made his performance memorable the cameo of julia stiles though i really didnt enjoy it was nice that she was in there but her talents were not really used i felt that they could have switched her and franka potente now that wouldve probably worked overall this film was worth it i definitely classify it with my favourite film of this genre the day of the jackal go see it if you i was sure not disappointed in fact ive recommended it to everyone i know,intelligence
is one of those classic spy thriller movies it has the great action the romance and of course the edge of your seat thrills one of the best parts of this movie that i thought was the car chase sequence through paris it was one of those classic chase scenes that are very rare to find in movies is most certainly to a classic spy thriller,intelligence
i am fortunate enough to live close to 2 outdoor theatres  i saw at one of themit was enjoyable to me  i liked the plot and i thought the acting was good also  some of the action shots were a little grim but i attribute this to what i would grade as lousy editingi dont know why some movie editors think there is some law against developing more than a 30 second scene  the unending stacatto mtv music video type editing of 3 second shots really irritated me  the music they used didnt help much eitheri think with the proper editing and music this would have been an 8 out of 10  in stead i give it a 6 12it is a joy to watch matt damon at work  for my money he is destined to be one of the days greatest actors,intelligence
ive been reading the reviews and frankly i got real sick of people writing a review for a movie they obviously knew none of the background to i believe one person said it was cliche entertainment that its all been done before  no way really  probably because there was a tv movie done back in 1988  or that it was a book long before then  did it ever occur to any of these people that its the other movies which are cliched and that this one is trying to pay at least a little homage to the guy who invented a lot of this  forget tom clancy  ludlums been writing this stuff longerbut i got a similar vibe from people about minority report too  it hasnt occurred to 98 of the viewership that its based on a story written what 40 50 years ago  pkd is the man  hes the reason the twisted plot is so popular now  i hate idiots who write without understandingi dig this movie  its fun  sure it deviates from the original story but oh well  that was written waybackwhen and its been updated a little and much as i never really cared about matt damon at all i think he did a pretty decent job with this character  thumbs up,intelligence
doug liamns from a novel by robert ludlum is intriguing has plenty of tenseenergetic scenes and also slower paced ones made to create a keen semispy effect has originality too which you wouldnt expect from a thriller from the hollywood gene pool of latedamon is bourne or was bourne before he was found floating in the ocean and picked up by a fishing boat where he has a couple of bullets in his back and more importantly a swiss bank account in his hip  this is useful since the man has amnesia cant remember who he is but can remember all of the old tactics from his past in instinct fashion  this then sets him off on his mission to paris along with gypsy potente and the cia following his moves  you might sport familiar material but liman counteracts with a structure scene for scene that keeps constant exhiliration  add to that damon gives off persistance of character that pays off all the way to the last scene  a full out action movie that works on kinetic and thinking levels either 1015 or possibly 510 on my best of the year list  grade strong a,intelligence
where to start off on a movie like this matt damon prooves himself a worthy action star as he runs jumps crawls climbes punches kicks and shoots his way to freedom this could very well be the best action movie since last year when slyvester stallone toar up the screen in get carter this movie is what u get when you take long kiss goodnight and mix it with universial soilder and add just a bit of misson impossible on top with a story that is somewhat similar to that of the replacement killers yes it is that good damon is bounre or at least he thinks see he cant remember who he is or what he does but he sure does know how to kick some serious ass his body is found in the water with two bullet holes in his back and a device in his hip with a saftey depostie box number on it in the box he finds a bunch of fake passports lots of money and a gun now the real journey begins because someone wants bourne dead and he is on a misson to find out who he is and who he is running from damon and run lola run star franka potente have perfect chemestry on the screen and chris cooper is perfect as the man who wants bourne dead this movie also has one thrill ride of a car chase in it and many great action scenes that with have your blood racing and even though it runs about two hours long it never once becomes boring or over wrote there are even a few good one liners from potente this is the way action movies should be made and i hope to see damon in many more to come because he is the perfect action movie star if you only go to see one movie this summer do yourself a favour and make it ,intelligence
i approached with no bias i hadnt read the book and i wasnt a huge fan of matt damon that said i found very entertaining youll get a lot of ludlum fans getting very anal about the treatment of the book but at the end of the day youre left with a tight solid spy thriller very reminisent of the cold war spy films of the 60s and 70s it has a very dark look and feel to it it also has a feeling of unpredictabilty to it you feel that any one of the main protagonists is expendable even damon and that gives the film a real edge an 8 out of 10 and well worth a look,intelligence
it does what its intended to do well luckily the film only touched on what could have ruined the film a wannabe 007 romance however matt damon is no sean connery character development is limited to damons attempt at remembering how smart he was in good will hunting uh i was like smart or something but now im like strong,intelligence
obviously this movie concept has been done many times beforespoilera black ops agent develops amnesia after attempting to asassinate hisher target and becomes a nice person in the amnestic state while trying to find out hisher true identityi think this was much better done in the long kiss goodnight 1996 with geena davis and samuel jacksoni suggest you rent and watch this movie if you liked ,intelligence
i went to see this movie knowing that most of my friends and family had loved it when they saw it i loved the fast pace action and the clips of the car chase that you see in the advertisements are just teasers  matt damon was wonderful as always  this was the first time i had seen franka potente in anything but i really enjoyed her performance i loved that she was not a screaming whining girl every time the action got going i loved it and would recommend this movie to anyone looking for some good action and a pretty good story too,intelligence
when i had a chance to watch this for tha first time i decided not to and went and checked out minority report which was surprisingly good then when i had another chance to watch this movie i took it because most of my friends said it was good id have to admit though this movie did keep me off my seat instead of laying back almost falling asleep this movies carries the picture of a super soldiermatt damon who is unstoppable in the martial arts and using weapons but has the same weakness as all super soldiers his weakness is children ive seen two other movies that deal with soldiers who are weak to children one is soldier with kurt russel and the other is universal soldiers the first one with jean claude van damme would i watch this again probably not overall i rated this movie a 5 because the action scenes were decent and if this movie wanted the full 10 they would need to complete good action and a good plot,intelligence
i heard some buzz that this was an above average flick  i will ignore the buzz from now on  this movie was interesting for about 30 minutes and then it just became boring  you have seen every scene in this movie  it is really by the number moving making with europe as the backdrop instead of the us  the only problem is that this movie doesnt have anything interesting  matt damon plays bourne as you might expect  potentes character of marie is ok but doesnt stand out  the government agents are the same as every movie of this type  the ending is weak and anticlimaticthis movie gets 4 out of 10,intelligence
i went into this movie not knowing what it was about although the plot is not too original the editing and the actors filling these rolls are i loved this definately cant wait for the dvd this movie kept my attention from beginning till end its a combination of luc besson meets spy game and the saint the really nice thing about this flick is that it is believable except the falling down the stairshaft riding the dead guy ok you can listen to all the other critics bitch and moan that its not perfect to their satisfaction but if you love movies like me especially action watch this at least twice way to go matt,intelligence
the user comment currently on the front page for this movie contains the assumption that the film changing lanes is brilliant so it becomes clear that some imdb users will always be insanematt damon is a thinking mans actor  ben affleck is not  while the two came together effectively enough in good will hunting its much more fun to watch damon on his own here as both bourne and the viewer find out more and more about just what this man is capable of  its not handed to you on a platter as with most hollywood fare a certain intellectual flexibility is required to watch the character literally start from scratch and learn whats been hidden in his mind both physically and emotionally a little bit at a timethis is of course assuming you buy the brainfree conceit that the character really did lose all his memories but millions of robert ludlum readers my mother is one i am not seemed to buy it just fine  of course the movie doesnt even begin to resemble the book on any level imagine that but as a standalone story its a pretty good time at the moviesa whole lot of great character stuff in damons scenes with two great fights on either end and a wellstaged car chase in the middle though all three are hastily edited  chris cooper remains the most uncharismatic actor i can think of how did he pull off lone star anyway but the real stars here are damon and potente  theyre given as much character as they can really have in a a 2hour movie which also has to have enough action to keep affleck fans entertained and b something tony gilroy helped writetheres something here for everyone combining the pointless nastiness of changing lanes and the intellectual balsa wood of spiderman into something you can actually leave the theater thinking about or not depending on your taste  to call it cliche is to not even pay attention yes there are spies and yes theres a chase  but theyre handled in innovative exciting ways without resorting to the vacant hocuspocus of the saint or the blind stupid luck of any film starring arnold schwarzenegger  anyone who says differently must have expected bourne to burst into song because theres really only so many ways you can go in a spy movie or in a western or whatever  pay attention people85 of 10 which im rounding up cuz i like doug liman  i really shouldnt grant the 5 because not one character had a sense of humor and this big international thriller had too many closeups as if liman were making tinybudgeted swingers again  but i cant help myself i had too much fun  keep at it doug,intelligence
possible spoilers having read other comments the worst departure from the book  no explanation at all for the amnesia the book had bourne getting shot in the head  secondly changing the villainthe book was quite suspenseful where the movie is only marginally sothat said the movie is excellent entertainment  as others say the car chase scene kicks  and the fight scenes imo are first rate  the pacing works very well  just enough plot to get the point across  matt damon is very believable and franka potente comes off well as an aimless drifter another disappointing departure from the book for me anyway,intelligence
so you see the preview for the new action movie starring matt damon it looks good so you plan to see it  you find out there is a book that its based on so you think reading it before you see the movie might be a good idea if you got time to kill  that is where your wrongthe movie was good it had an okay story  the book was great it had an awesome story  why did we change the story so much there was barely a shred of the book in the movie why did we call it if it had basically nothing to do with the plot of the book with the same titleyou like matt damon  see the movie he did an excellent job with the character  want to know how great the movie could have been  read the book,intelligence
a person gets shot falls into the water loses their memory and when they are rescued they find out that they are assassins for the cia no the long kiss goodnight starring geena davis and samuel l jackson released in america in october 1996 and written by shane black i dont know when ludlum wrote but they never should have made this movie i guess its for people with short memory problems who wouldnt remember the first time it was made shoulda cast geena davis and sam jackson again but i guess you can only get amnesia so many times and make it believable there should be an unwritten hollywood law against rehashing scripts or plot lines that are less than ten years old some of us can remember things that happened more than two or three minutes ago,intelligence
i did not plan to see this movie originally  i just see it today i like this movie better than minority report  minority report is ok but not great  a classic spy assassin thriller with plenty of action romantic martial art car chase etc  i would give this a 9 all things considered,intelligence
warning  this movie contains no spoilers i dont think it wants to let you know what its abouti was very disappointed in though maybe i shouldnt have been  perhaps its only a matter of time before someone will enlist top acting talent and the best equipment and action directing for a flopwas it just me or did the emperor have no clothes  was this movie like certain rock concerts where you have to have already heard the cds in order to have any idea what theyre doing onstage  having not read the book i didnt see what was going on beside the obvious though i did get a vague impression there was some kind of ingenious fillip at the end involving the main characters amnesia perhaps being an integral part of his programmed agent rolelacking that bit or even not this movie is sort of like opera a thread of a plot supposedly raised to the level of high art by dint of its glorious trappings  the only problem here is that whereas opera has going for it a genuine kernel of human drama and passion all this movie has is yetanother tweak to the rather worn and cheap spookparanoid fantasy thriller theme this theme screams alienation so loud that the love interest is inaudible read  gratuitous  these fantasies perhaps only really serve to remind us in that coy clever underhanded and these days maddingly prevailing way that democracy really is dead in this country  so just give up  why do we shell out sheckles for this  why do we pay to be told what we really thinkinteresting side note  walking out of the dark theatre into the hallway a theatre worker was handing out free suckers to the exiting patrons  i declined  but i had a couple of afterthoughts  one was that i should have taken the sucker so id have gotten something for my 750  the other was a strange wondering if there was a subconscious message being delivered they were acknowledging we were suckers for going to that movie  life is but a dream wotsad to see this movie right after the talented mr ripley  or for that matter the princess and the warrior or american beauty or or,intelligence
this movie was rated with 4 stars get realmaybe on a scale of ten the title should be bourne butchered did anybody who made this movie read the original book by rludlum why is it that a great book has to be so poorly presented dont waste your money on this onerent the one made for tv which comes prety close to the book,intelligence
i confess that i didnt think this movie was going to be that good the only i chose this movie was because it had julia stiles in itthough she didnt have a large partbut the movie was great the action started in the beginning and didnt stop till the endits a great movie,intelligence
one thing after watching this three times in the theatre you might think im a fanatic i just like to really know what im reviewing before i review it one thing stands out in my mindwatch this movie i mean it real good sometimes cliched entertainment the sort thats titled heart pounding and edgeofyourseat fun it gets you involved with the characters in a way in which i gotta say the book never did acting is excellent cinematography is original really fantastic gave the film a stylistic twist on the jump cutting of your usual thriller now remember if this great little movie is cliched its because it comes from a book written when spythriller cliche wasnt much of a problem this was the original the 70s invented the spy novel and thats where the movie comes from so not only is sleek told with flair and creativity its also got an excuse for its old hat plot thats something most movies dont have an excuse the musics great too if a little retroseventies french pop ive been what you might call a rabid fan of powell and gregson williams for a while and this stuff by powell is really good my mother and i keep comparing this movie to spy game one of my favorites and i have to say it really gives spy game a run for its money it aspires to being less cerebral than that lovely film but the bourne id has enough brains of its own it never lost my interest even the third time i went to see it it drives right along at a glorious pace propelling you through france with delightful if not dizzying speed treasure a spy movie that actually gets you involved in deciphering the characters personalities james bond this is not and doesnt suffer from the comparison i probably could find some negative comments to make about it but i dont want to take the time right now just see it ps the car chase youve heard is good and the best part of the movie really is,intelligence
ive never been a fan of ludlums novels but i love this movie i read the first 6 or 7 ludlum books and they all seemed to be the same plot same characters same implausible and tedious worldspyvillain conspiracies etc either ludlum has matured and now writes better books or else this screenplay simply departed from his norm and did something different ludlum is also credited as executive producer of this flick whatever that means this movie version of a ludlum book has snap depth and an interest that goes far beyond ludlums 1970s and 1980s workmatt damon is brilliant he has a believability and warmth that most other action star kind of doods sorely lack franka potente really establishes herself as an amazing and wonderful new international star she spoke english before in blow but had a limited role in that movie here she gets to be the costar holds a major role and carries almost as much of the flick as matt damon she is the real deal her intelligence grace and charm of course always shined through to american audiences in her german language roles she is equally attractive and compelling speaking english this time i expect to see much more of her in the futureoverall a great movie and a great couple of hours spent in the theater topnotch entertainment,intelligence
i wasnt a big matt damon fan but i am now  i liked the talented mr ripley and went to see it because of paltrow and jude law but i walked away from it liking damon toonow with damon has definitely found a great role and he plays it very well  geez i was blown away by the quickness of the film it seemed to pick me up soon after sitting down in the theater and took me for a fine ride  no gratuitous sex or silly love storyness to get in the way just good old thrills mystery action and outright fun  i love a movie that makes you jump out of your seat and when the whole audience does it several times you know the movie is goodi highly recommend you see this movie  the car chase scene throughout the streets of paris is amazing   no hills like there were in mcqueens bullit but some fancy car dancing that was a thrill a minutego see it,intelligence
yes this movies plot doesnt have much in common with the novel from which it takes its name  is that a bad thing  not really  its just a brand identity an alltooimportant reality of todays movie marketplace this movie takes the basic elements of ludlums story  the amnesiac superspy discovering his abilities and his past as he struggles to stay ahead of people trying to kill him  and does something that ludlum would never have considered in his wildest dreams  it grounds the story in a physical and emotional reality recognizable from the real world  groundbreaking reallyfor those of you and there seem to be a lot of you posting reviews here who have a strong if inexplicable attachment to ludlums turgid original and are mystified that this version tosses out carlos the jackal entirely pick up a newspaper sometime  the book was written in the 70s when carlos  yes a real terrorist  was still at large and his identity uncertain ludlum played guessing games about who carlos really was  since carlos  ilich ramirez sanchez  was captured in the mid90s and is in prison in france that wouldnt really have flown in this movie,intelligence
we saw this movie within a week or two of minority report and preferred bourne identity bi had practically no slow moments and the staging of the action scenes was firstrate if you are a fan of fastpaced action flicks check it out youll dig bi for sure,intelligence
i went into not expecting much but i was pleasantly surprised  matt damon was excellent the action was very well done and the story was engaging and suspenseful enough to keep me interested the whole time  some of the acting particularly of the female lead was underwhelming but overall it was a very entertaining movie,intelligence
after reading and loving this novel at least 4 times i was soooo disappointed by the first movie version  the newest version while making some changes from the book is a topnotch actualization of the book  matt damon and franka potente are perfect and so is chris cooper one of the great supporting actors working,intelligence
matt damon is excellent in this thriller whose mysteries remain unsolved up until the very end chris cooper was well cast for his role as the man hunting jason bourne julia stiles fits well into all of her three lines in the whole movie,intelligence
ive never read the book but i liked the movie it had a neat premise and great action scenes its a bit light in terms of story and theres not a lot in the way of character development either but thats really no great loss because this movie is driven by action and in that sense its really good the stunts are done in such a way that they dont seem that implausible and youll find yourself rooting for matt damon who is pretty good in the role of the action hero,intelligence
first off i went to go see bourne identity without having read the book so i was not familiar with the story all that well i thought it was a great movie one of the best i have seen all year after disappointments like legend of bagger vance matt damon puts in an incredible performance both this and sum of all fears were great action movies and i wouldnt recommend one over the other if you want great action i suggest going to see both5compy,intelligence
better than sum of all fears in so many ways  i read the book around 86 or 87 but beyond the general concept i have no memories beyond enjoying it that was an unintention nonpun  i still feel matt damon was miscast but he did an excellent job  the movie had an excellent euro feeling to it that was inspiring and consistent  the story unfolded perfectly and remained taught and sharp and cool  i am curious as to whether or not this is one of those movies where the studio tinkered with the directors planned ending because though well done the last scenes felt as tackedon as blade runners sunny drive off in to the creditsthose things aside this movie rocked  it was slight retromodern with just enough isolation and paranoia to give you that comfortable elsewhere feeling  franka was simply awesome  her and toni collette are easily the finest of the leastknown actress crowd of todaydont miss this movie  especially if you like the eurofeel of movies like frantic ronin and the like,intelligence
if youre here you already know that is a spy thriller starring matt damon in the title role and potente god thats a cool last name unless youre dutch or belgian or something and your given name is wim as the love interest and france as the backgroundwhat you need to know is this this movie has maybe the best car chase scene ever now i havent seen that many of them but for example it and i mean the chase heres so much better than recent movies about fastcars like gone in 60 seconds which does have a coolish car chase scene but is largely spoiled by the stupid constructionramp thing and the fact that hes being chased partially by helicopter and fast and the furious which should be burned for the fact that despite being a fastcar movie it doesnt have a single car chase scene like how stupid is that  oh yes the chase here is excellent over the partlycobbled streets of oldcity paris where you feel like youre in a car chase even if youre just trying to drive slowly and peacefully  which reminds me  id actually watch a movie of 2 straight hours of a driver trying to manoeuvre in paris traffic damon and potente are in a little red morris mini and the paris police are on i think citroen saxos and cheap motorbikes which just shows you the greatness of the cars have absolutely nothing to do with the greatness of the car chases  the cinematographystuntworkcgi or whatever it is here is aweinspiring to watch as in perfect coordination all the cars in traffic seem to be just about to hit and be hit by the little mini but not quite as it accelerates swerves dodges and handbraketurns truly the stuff of movie legendas i said the mini seems to have a character all its own too bad that isnt true for any of its human costars  the story here is stupid the suspense completely lacking gee i wonder if matt damon is a spy or just some guy who is astonishingly adept at spying behaviour and is chased by the spy agency for no real reason and the attention to detail  something that made spy game for example so enjoyable  is completely lacking for example in one of the climactic scenes at the end the time of day switches from total darkness to noonhour sunshine in a matter of seconds and bourne in cyrillic is apparently ltsshfum really how expensive is it to hire a guy who can read cyrillic hell i would have done it for two buckswhat else can i tell you spy game is a much superior movie in the same vein but see this one nevertheless cause of the car chase,intelligence
i havent read the book but the movie stands up well on its own and is much better than that pc potboiler sum of all fearsthe plot was intriguing and kept me interested throughout damon and potente are well matched and do a fine job she is a german actress who seems to have managed to speak well unaccented american english the mystery of who the damon character really is and how he discovers his special talents was effective the fight scenes and supporting cast all were goodi didnt buy two scenes damons human fly act outside the us embassy and the ride the corpse down five stories and walk away act the last one was a bit much to take straining credulitybut all in all it was a fun movie and im glad i saw it seven out of ten maybe seven and a half,intelligence
great movie not by a longshotambitious nointellectually engaging nopevery original nahdoes it beat the snot out of sum of all fears another spy film that isnt great ambitious intellectually engaging or original either totallythis is because it never once pretends its anything other than it is and doesnt waste our time suggesting it has anything to say at all about sweeping issues like sum didspoilersthe gag is that this affable young guy who doesnt want to harm anyone has a surprising ability to both physically and mentally annihilate anyone who gets in his path and i have to say it kept me riveted through most of the moviei broke my promise to myself that id never again watch a show based on the premise of amnesia its such a lame exhausted gimmick because i heard this picture had a really good car chase scene and because it had franka potente in it  who so appealing in run lola run there wasnt enough of either the car chase scene couldnt hope to rival the best of alltime for my money the one in to live and die in la and there wasnt enough of potentebut the movie delivered in other ways chief among them were the sly ways our hero would get out of a jam the end of the last action sequence in the stairwell was just believable enough to have you applauding its originality instead of bemoaning its likelihoodand hey what the hell else do you want from a spy thriller its a bunch of twodimensional characters who dont grow and who go chasing around trying to find clever ways to get past each otheri liked itwhat i cant figure out is why so many people on imdb who gave sum of all fears a free pass seem to be dumping on unassuming little sum suckedthis movie review by erik gloor,intelligence
i loved bourne identity maybe i am a sucker for foreign locales but this movie kept me glued i love james bond movies and spy novels and this movie really kept me going it was loud fast and had a great intrigue perhaps this wasnt a huge hollywood project with tons of effects but it was classic spy and the casting was terrific,intelligence
i thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes were top notch and the locations rocked i dont get all these reviews by people that were hoping to see the book word for word on the screenand because it wasnt there the movie automatically sucked a book is a booka movie is a moviethey really shouldnt be compared if you like top quality action movies with a good plot and good actingcheck this one out,intelligence
this movie alone was great however i read the book beforehand and i dont think they shouldve even called the movie i dont know maybe movies dont always follow books that well but they should at least a little ok i admit he had a chip in his hip with his bank account number his name was jason bourne it wasnt even that in the booklater you find out that it was david webb his girls name was marie even though she had a much huger part in the book and treadstone was mentioned oh yeah and he had amnesia thats about all that is the same if you have read the book get ready to be appalled none of the places he goes to are the same none of the people except abbott and conklin and i didnt even hear their names mentioned in the movie i had to look online other than the fact that it had nothing to do with the book carlos wasnt even mentioned it was a good movie damon did the role wonderfully and looked like he knew what he was doing in the action scenes he was the perfect chameleon as the book says could look like a normal person if you want to read the book read it it is wonderful if you do be prepared for the movie i realize they couldnt have put all 535 pages in but they couldve put a lot more if you dont want to read it then see the movie it is wonderful,intelligence
let me first say this  this movie will not be considered for any academy awards and wont end up on many peoples top ten list  however for a actionadventure spy flick it really is pretty goodi will admit that i am not big into spy movies and most of my exposure to them consists of bond and mission impossible  if you like bond and mission impossible you should definitely like this movie  the movie tended to only push the limits of believability a little bit which is much more than i can say for most movies in this genrei should also say that i havent read this particular book  i read two of ludlums books and discovered they both had the same plot  perhaps the folks making the movie decided to alter the plot so that it wouldnt be exactly like all the other ludlum books out theretdp,intelligence
someone didnt read the book  they plucked jason bourne out of the book but left all the other characters behind  ok they used the name marie  but nothing else about her  and then they forgot the plot  oh wellbesides that it had its moments fun summer flick,intelligence
spoilers although i like matt damon as an actor despite all the pretty horses this movie didnt really do much for me  after seeing the trailers i thought that it would be a decent movie  im not saying that it was a bad movie but it was very anticlimatic all the way through  im not really sure if there was a climax in this film at all  it certainly wasnt in the ending where you figure he would face off against someone  but apparently by reading some of the other comments they took one of the main characters from the book out of the movie  one silly thing was why did he go through all the trouble of cutting and dying the girls hair and then changing nothing on himself  not even a fake mustache or something  maybe he figured they would be saying that looks a lot like the man were looking for but the girls hair is shorter and a different color so that cant be jason bournewith these negative aspects the movie does have good action scenes and it was interesting to see matt damon in this type of role  i think that he did a pretty decent job its just too bad that the writing for the movie wasnt a little better 6510,intelligence
i went into this one expecting some solid mindless mayhem good popcorn flick  i use quotes cause i dont usually eat popcorn at movies since i go to matinees right after having lunch  got that  then some cinematically so far this is my biggest pleasant surprise of the year really holds together well  granted one needs to accept the premise particularly the amnesia bit just out of curiosity has anyone in history ever actually had amnesia just cause theres a word for something doesnt mean it exists ive never seen a unicorn for instance  it wouldve been great if someone in the movie preferably franka had said amnesia dont only people on soap operas have thatwell now that ive mentioned franka guess its chiefly due to her that this one works so well for me  this is a genuine fox  got an immediate crush on her in run lola run  thought well its too bad she cant have an englishspeaking film career since she doesnt resemble sarah michelle goddamned geller or some such  but look at those eyes dammit   pair her up with a leading man even somewhat bearable  bingo  matt damon is one of the few young leading men these days about whom the word likable pops up hard to say why hes likable  i dont know about art but i know what i like  theres a kind of grace to him onscreen an antiinyourface quality its as though hes embarrassed to get caught getting depicted by way of contrast i wish his buddy ben affleck would just go away afflecks like a goyisher adam sandler who knows hes annoying  makes it work for him  affleck doesnt seem to know hes annoying which makes it even more annoying  this reluctanthero persona can be absolute gold in the action realm steve mcqueen comes to mind  in this movie damon  potente together have charisma out the wazoo  comes out in quiet little moments theyre in a car together or a diner one will glance at the other whatever  the scene in his apartment the two of them generate all the tension dont believe me  imagine the shooting script she comes out of the bathroom he picks up a knife he puts it down she looks around he looks around she smiles he frowns etc  the actors make it work franka even overcomes the flicks chief plot flaw once hes had his ride to paris  shes been paid theres really no reason at all for them to be together any more  she makes us believe her character knows she should split but just doesnt want tooh  supporting cast  chris cooper  brian cox  i think id pay to see cooper read the phone book that guy owns the screen when hes on it  his face is like the proverbial car wreck you cant not watch it whether you want to or not  his 3minute part in money train is acidetched into my brain for life cox  sorry anthony hopkins but coxs hannibel lecter was far superior every supporting part he plays is a treasure for me  plus all those great europeans i even got caught up in the card game on the boat at the beginning  they exude presence or something  even the painintheass african character was fascinating if for no other reason than how shamefully that continent gets ignored usually  less than a decade ago there was genocide occurring there to make bosnia look like burlesque  in the media it was a sideshow  if the corpses are black the world stands back  every part in this movie seemed to resonate the exasperated english friend the bespectacled sniper the blonde chickeach seemed a real entitybut of course its an action flick  as such more than passes muster sure there were some random musings here  there eg an american guy with amnesia on a french boat arrives in port why doesnt he immediately seek the nearest yank embassy or cops are chasing a carshouldnt they be radioing for more cops so that the chasee cant escape merely by shaking those few off or all those marines in the embassythey werent allowed to poke their heads out the door or not since bruce lee flicks have body blows sounded this loud  but what chiefly gave me pauseenough to make it the title of this pieceis the scene towards the endthis isnt a spoiler doesnt really affect the action one way or the otherdamon  cooper  the blonde chick are in a room having the big showdown   shes seen constantly up to a certain pointthen shes just not seen any more we dont see something happen to her in the room we dont see her leave the room i think we never see her again  she had had enough screen time that were led to believe shes at least somewhat significant to the proceedingscertainly we see what happens to certain characters with much less screen timebut she just kinda evaporates  so what the hell happened to her  i even checked under goofs before beginning this piece thinking maybe it was just a continuity problem but bottom line see the movie its fun  i may even want to see it again before i groaningly drag my butt off to see minority report with spielberg apparently having decided he wants to be stanley kubrick the rest of his life  im not sure even kubrick wanted to be kubrick,intelligence
it is said that the hardest part about translating a good book into a movie is catching the spirit of the book  this movie actually manages to capture the spirit of the novel without ever using a single line or scene from the book  though the basic premise is the same so much has been altered from the book that it is amazing that the screenplay managed to convey the spirit and feeling of the book so well  this movie was thoroughly entertaining and extremely good on many levels  i would say that this is the best spyassassin movie that i have seen in many years and the performances are first rate  highly recommended,intelligence
there are two kinds of good movies ones that expand moviedom by carving a new niche or genre and ones that are quality additions to existing niches and genresbourne identity is the second kind of moviesome viewers here have complained that this movie is a rehashing of existing formulaic spy plots and that its predictable  well i counter those comments by accusing these viewers of being fools to expect otherwise from a spy thriller movie in the same niche as ronin and mission impossible i promises good kickbutt action and adrenalized narrative  also delivers exactly that  there are no attempts at cultivating a complicated character narrative nor are there spielbergesque attempts at social or political commentary  this movie is about 115 minutes of fun spy actionhighlights of this movie  the handtohand combat scenes were tremendously choreographed the rockclimbing scene on the side of the building is a memorable demonstration of good climber form car chases were delightful and flavored nicely with european scenery franka potente is a wellchosen female supporting character and she avoids falling into an archetypal girlygirl role the movie is paced well and visually narrated welllow points of this movie almost no comic relief just when a good chuckle would relieve some tension the tension just keeps building a couple of scenes were muddled with the obscured camera anglesoverall if you like spy stuff and you enjoyed ronin spy games mi1 and mi2 then this is more action fodder for you  action fans will definitely get their moneys worth at halfprice and diehard action fans will get their moneys worth at full price35 stars out of 5,intelligence
i saw this movie today it was somebody elses choice how lucky i was it is thoroughly entertaining and elegant there is no room for pretentiousness the relatively fast pace never loses momentum without relying on videoclip type editing which i usually find so annoying the script is well written reserved and stripped down to essentials without lapsing into mametstyled affectations paris looks beautiful in any season but one rarely gets to see it so beautiful in winter its great to see la defense on film after so many years of it being there the acting is superb the movie is cast from strength matt damon proves to be a very convincing action hero certainly stronger than keanu reeves or tom cruise his reserve gives the character strength and the right degree of remoteness his natural charm is held in check this man is a killer for hire which in itself assumes a certain insularity in dealing with the world everybody else is fine the score is particularly interesting relies a lot on clever use of percussion my theater had great surroundsound it makes a difference it reminded me of stewart copelandthe movie conjures an atmosphere of cold objectivity which fits the story perfectly it gives it a special flavor and makes it the quality entertainment film it is its a classy flick see it in the theatre,intelligence
in an era when weve been begging for a decent james bond flick this movie comes along and shows that hollywood can still make a great movie about spies and intrigue with a minimum of explosions and special effects  damon portrays a spy who has lost his identity and has to find himself without the use of a bunch of silly props and gadgets i also like the chemistry between damon and franka potente unlike a lot of the stupid helpless women we have to endure in thrillers potente brings a smart clever presence to the movie this film is also beautifully filmed with fine sweeping images of the alps paris and the cote dazur and excellent editing my only complaint a couple of the fight scenes were hard to believe still this is a great movie especially by todays standards,intelligence
first of all before seeing this movie i didnt read the book  so i was dont really knowing the story but it was looking good  for the first 15 minutes i found it a little bit boring but after i drop in the story and i didnt want it to stop  matt damon is really good as jason bourne  and finally i have to say that the numerous action sequences are very well done and astonishing  a 2002 summer must see,intelligence
thought not the best certainly qualifies as a good filmthose that are action thriller fans should not miss it others will also enjoy itthe action and direction of the movie are quite goodthe story is about a person suffering from amnesia but he is not a routine fellow something different and that makes it more entertainingits not a donotmiss movie but is certainly good viewing without doubt,intelligence
a friend of mine gay male says he could enjoy watching matt damon reading the phone book this movie is for people who demand more but not much more  matts hair is now brown instead of blond and he now goes for a whole movie without flashing his big white teeth in a pretty boy smile he is trying to look like a tough competitor for action films so all the roles dont go to his pal ben affleck or to tom cruise  does it work  sure matt is a fine actor and great to look at too      possible spoilers  this movie is supposedly based on a robert ludlum book  the script was probably good when it was written but as it got doctored up and edited to bits its a ridiculous mess  that is why i prefer independent films where the writer is often the actual writer rather than having a whole crew of hacks deciding what the story will be      the story as far as i can figure is about a cia assassin matt damon who goes onto a yacht to kill an african man with a french accent who is some sort of leader of somebody and has an attitude problem that makes someone else want to kill him anyway the assassin gets shot and tossed in the ocean where he is rescued by a boatful of extras and stuntmen who look vaguely eastern european  oddly the same extras and stuntmen are used much later in the film to play cia agents who come to attack matt damon in his hotel room    the whole idea here is amnesia which as far as i know only occurs in movies the assassin cant remember who he is or why people are chasing him the people chasing him as it turns out are his employers and the audience can never really understand why they are chasing him either   the cia has imbedded some sort of little capsule the size of a little vitamin pill into the assassins skin  when it is excised the capsule shines a little light that projects the name of a bank and an account number  how convenient  matt knows what swiss bank to go to and his account number  he goes there and gets into his safe deposit box to find a big pile of money and a bunch of fake ids  this would make his life a lot easier except he packs the  stuff into a red bag which makes him easier to spot wherever he goes  he can get a car hair dye scissors etc but cannot seem to locate a different bag in all of europe  when police are chasing him and calling out hey red bag that would seem to be a clue to get a new bag   matt the assassin aware that the cia is trying to kill him sets up a meeting with his cia boss out on a bridge in paris  why  to kill him  to be killed  we dont know or care     in this movie we see matt climbing on a rusty fire escape down the outside of a smooth brick building driving in a clever chase scene where his vehicle is a pokey little car fighting off and shooting lots of guys blowing things up etc  the womens roles in this movie are hilarious  franke potente gets to stand within arms length and watch as matt fights a cia goon to the death it never occurs to the goon to harm her and she does not appear afraid she just stands there and watches  later the same thing happen with julia stiles just standing there  apparently women in this movie are invisible and invulnerable to harm   this movie is goofy mindless fun for those who want to see beautiful grayish cinematography of sights in europe  it is sure to be a big hit in europe  it is surely not oscar material or even anything you will want to see twice unless you are fixated on matt or franke,intelligence

this film is strong because matt damon delivers the knife fight scene in the first half of the movie is thrilling and fastpaced the car chase and the other combat scenes are just as compelling however there are a few pervasive shortcomings in the film the first has to do with casting why was julia stiles in the movie what purpose does her character serve maybe she was trying to break her typecast as a lead in teen movies but this role affords her but the most vapid of lines the second casting question mark comes with adewale akinnuoyeagbaje he is absolutely brilliant in oz but really does not fit this role this is a perfect segway into the second error of the plot is thinner than dental floss the beginning and the end of the film pass by in a flash leaving the viewer confused and disappointed an example of this comes at the beginning of the film and its introduction of adewale akinnuoyeagbajes character who is he again i was not quite certain of this i still to this day cannot decide whether he was a political hotshot or religious figure of some sorts another example comes at the end of the film but has its roots all throughout what is treadstone is in an implant a mindcontrol device it is left vague one could always use their imagination but this vaguery does not bode well for the film treadstone whatever it is is quickly put under raps at a congressional hearing it is over in fifteen seconds without any explanation that was easy the plot focuses solely on action but great action movies have stronger plots than this movie has plot is essential and one will find strong plots in such movies as timecop and bloodsport these films have story lines to them that evince stark fluidity and lucidity overall the action sequences were strong and the movie does make for good entertainment matt damon and franka potente have great chemistry and i hope to see them in a film again  and the movie does make for good entertainment matt damon and franka potente have great chemistry and i hope to see them in a film again,intelligence

possible unimportant spoilersin this summer of the good will hunting boys becoming spies matt damons venture here as jason bourne is far superior to ben afflecks turn as jack ryan in the sum of all fears damon even compares favorably to the last few james bonds although this could be due to the bond formula getting tireddamon is a different kind of spy not since connery has bond been as dangerous as jason bourne he is made all the more dangerous by the fact that he has amnesia he doesnt know how or why he knows how to do martial arts or how to assess possible escape routes when entering a new place he just does it like reading or writingand its this unknown element which makes so intriguing how do we even know we should be on bournes side we know as little about him for the first part of the movie as he does and yet there we are watching him on as he thrashes two parisian policemen in a park or tears through a us embassy should we be hoping he escapes or gets captured i guess for the sake of entertainment we want him to escape or else it would be a rather short moviethe supporting players dont particularly shine or stand out here chris cooper makes a decent adversary for bourne although it would have been more satisfying to see a bigger name actor in this part franka potente is simply there as an allylove interest for damon her part could have been played by just about anyone julia stiles is julia stiles unlikable as always shes only on screen for about 10 minutes total thankfully and coopers character seems as dismissive of her character as i am of her as an actresslet me stop being negative though because i did very much enjoy this film the fight scenes are well done if short save for one lengthy brutal encounter in bournes apartment and there is a fantastic car chase the movie takes place almost entirely in paris which of course makes for some beautiful shots of the city i may be the only one that says this but i think stands up rather well when compared to this summers other big manontherun picture minority report both received 7s out of 10 from me,intelligence
it has been since ive seen mission impossible that i didnt enjoy an actionthriller movie so much the plot is well written greatly directed the action is always pretty good realistic and violent matt damon acts very well and he is perfect in his role paris is wonderful as always and at the beginning of the movie you can feel al the different languages that mix in europe very fascinating if you like actionthriller movie this is a must,intelligence
so a man is picked up at sea with two bullet holes in his back and a laser chip in his hip  quite a premise and one that robert ludlum took to three books in the 80s  ludlums character jason bourne comes alive in this well directed and excitingly acted film the story and action are updated for the current time but remain true to their original intentwhile this is an action film and there is a villain the inimitable chris cooper of lonesome dove and lone star to name a few the real conflict resides in the character of bourne himself  he has no memory but knows how to do all sorts of cool and scary things  he can recite the license plate numbers of the six cars outside the diner and he can also use a gun and his body as lethal weapons  in the skilled hands of damon jason bourne takes on a vulnerability that is appealing and confusing when set against his obvious talent for murderwhen he inadvertently hooks up with marie kreutz franka potente the story twists and turns to its inevitable conclusion  no one ever accused ludlum of being the great american novelist but his stories are packed with suspense the audience jumped in unison about three times yesterday and are clever and fundoug liman uses paris beautifully  making that great city a part of the story  the cinematography is wonderful in bringing us into the hushed halls of swiss banking to  a farmhouse in the countryside with the same loving care  the camera wobbles and dives and gives the viewer an unsettled feeling  not unlike that which bourne himself must be feelingi recommend this movie and think there will be sequels since bourne is a complicated protagonist and we still want to find out what the heck treadstone is,intelligence
matt does as best as he can with this role  although we will always think of him as the filthy massachussetts townie from good will hunting nonetheless the film is weak with a dopey plot and a fartoo sunshiney ending that spits in the face of the gritty european feel this film was going forlet me tell you  if you want the ultimate european spy thriller movie  better than all the bonds put together with a genuine dark shadowy european feel without the vomitlike ending try ronin  it is a highly similar genre and five times the movie that bourne is,intelligence
matt damon delivers a riveting performace as jason bourne a man whos wanted by assassins and suffering from memory loss  along the way he gets a woman to help him they drive around europe hide out when ever they can and both are wanted by the authorities  the coolest scene in the movie was the car chase scene ive always had an affinity for car chase movies critics have even compared it to gene hackmans car chase scene in the french connection  it was that great  i also liked the chemistry between matt damon and the actress her name escapes me though  this psychological thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat and if youre a matt damon fan like me  an astonishing movie from beginning to end  its the best movie of this year so far  i give 4 stars   i hope to see matt damon in more great movies to come in the future  maybe hell even be in the next kevin smith movie,intelligence
the one thing i could say about this movie that would sum up exactly why i think this movie ranks with the ipcress file and three days of the condor as a stellar example of the spy genre it was made for grownupsgranted its got some great action scenes its got a subtle but definably techno soundtrack and it stars two young faces ready for the top story on entertainment tonight but it also has a brain it has an economy of style that has rarely been seen in a mainstream thriller since the 70s and it has a director that does not treat his audience like fiveyearolds reading them a story to shut them up so that he can get back to the other adultsthis isnt an epic you are not going to be shocked by logicbending twists and turns you are going to see a sophisticated story well told excitingly staged and convincingly realized by its cast there are no cavernous sets  this takes place in the real world or at least an excellent reproduction of it the cia office is not a pristine sterilized environment where higherups glare at a jumbotron with the world map on it and slam their fists on multimillion dollar control panels they work out of a cramped office with twoyearold computers paper maps and woodgrain panelling on the walls they do mot have the time nor the inclination to renovatedoug liman does the entire production an incredible service by treating his characters like real people their reactions make sense their dialogue comes out naturally there is chemistry between the leads because it is allowed to happen and is not forced franka potente and matt damon both bring an incredible presence to this movie  you want to see what theyll do next even if you may be able to predict it  you still want to see them do it chris cooper and clive owen in a disappointingly small role also keep their ends upand the action oh man these scenes are brilliantly shot and tightly edited  doug liman throws you right into the middle of deft handtohand combat parisian car chases and beautifully choreographed gunplay these scenes alone are enough to recommend this movieim in my midtwenties  i am very used to having movies targeted to my demographic most of the time filmmakers are willing to do anything to get asses in seats  pounding uptothe minute rock soundtrack transparent comic relief ta its not that im offended by these things  they have been known to turn out decent movies using this criteria but its nice every once in a while to have a movie that doesnt meet me halfway it makes me feel like they trust me910,intelligence

in anticipation for this movie i read the book by robert ludlum  the book was highly entertaining and well writtenunfortunately other than the title and the main character the movie bears no resemblance to the storyline of the book  being a canadian i was hoping that they would at least leave in the very intelligent and beautiful canadian economic ambassador marie  it seems that all they kept was the namethe story moved well the pacing was good and the action sequences most of the movie fit into the storyline and were except for some of the handtohand combat scenes believablethis is good summer action movie to see on a summers night or a rainy day if you havent read the book see the movie first  save the book for your summer vacation on the beach but do read the book,intelligence
a certain wellknown american movie critic has said bourne identity doug limans entry in the big budget spy film world is unnecessary unnecessary  i think its very necessary to have a good crisply made action movie with cool romantic locations a tough inscrutable hero a durable female sidekick and a bangup conclusion  we need good entertainment that pretends to be no more  what a relief bourne identity is after the laborious disappointments of minority reportbear in mind though that the same thing has been done before in a tv miniseries version of robert ludlums 1980 novel made in 1988 and starring richard chamberlain  and bear in mind that the novel is 22 years old and the depiction of the cia as invincible and potently evil is laughable post911i guess you have to go back a while to find fun these daysmatt damon comes through beautifully in this movie  he has a tautness and an edge of insecurity that are more than skin deep and the physicality to do his own stunts he wasnt quite right to play tom ripley but that wasnt his fault  here stripped of identity he does fine i tend to think of him as best cast as a bellhop but hes earned a second chance theres a chemistry between him and franka potente that isnt hurt at all by bournes coolness toward marie  chris cooper as the cia headman is a stereotype but brian cox as his boss has a sphinxlike vulnerability  it helped a lot that i knew him best as the charming creep in lie  all the bit parts are well played here  the cia sequences are overblown and silly but they keep the energy and excitement high and their occasional shrillness is counteracted by the intimacy and edge of fear in all damons scenes with potente i love the minimalist dialogue between jason and marie the stoic ideal is not deadas many car chases as weve seen in our lives this one through paris in an austin minicooper beats all for clarity neatness and speed  the choice of the tiny but ultramaneuverable british car was brilliant because this is a vehicle that really can get between the cracks  here as elsewhere the humor is subtle and not broadcast in our facesi wish liman had stopped jiggling his camera so much  even when maries reading a paper the camera shakes like a man with palsy  so her french sucks she isnt 85  but these quibbles subside as the action surges forwardis this a meaningless story hardly  the mystery of identity is one of the eternal questions of philosophy  here its just played for fun but it still can make you think  according to the old latin rule dulce et utile the sweetness makes it useful ie this movie instructs while it delights,intelligence
i saw the second week after it opened and i have to say i was really surprised by how good it was it was more realistic than other movies of this type and i like that it didnt go nuts with the violence and explosions this movie proves that you can make a compelling and thrilling action movie without excessive use of pyrotechnics matt damon who really looked like he could have been through military training gave a great and believable performance as did franka potente so much better for the part than a denise richards or halle berry say chris cooper and that guy who played the sniper whom by the way like liev schreiber in sum of all fears is an interesting enough character by themselves that you almost want to see an entire movie about their past adventures i think the makers of the next james bond and mission impossible should look at this movie and take notes and no you dont need to have helicopters with giant saw blades explosive bubble gum goofy gadget inventors or nuclear bombs with the nicely exposed wiring and red led readouts that will be diffused at 000001 to have an exciting actionspy movie my only critique is that a few of the fight scenes moved so fast that it was hard to see who was kicking whos ass but i suppose when i get this on dvd ill be able to see it more clearly,intelligence
for the second time this year the other being tom clancys the sum of all fears is an action movie that was based on a hit bestseller loosely based that is for those who have read bourne the characters are the same and that is where the similarities end the movie was well done and action packed and for the fans of the novel you will not be let down it is almost as if the movie is a different possibility of how robert ludlum could have started his best selling bourne series  matt damon was very well cast for the role of jason bourne,intelligence
starts out promisingly  its premise that a secret agentassassin has amnesia and is being hunted by his former employers is good if unoriginal  the setup to the movie promises a lot more than the actual film delivers  despite some entertaining action sequences the movie falls flat on its amnesiac headmatt damon does decently well in his action hero role though he does smarmy and sarcastic a lot better than cool and calculating  franka potente is the only real acting bright spot in this film  her character seems to have some depth and you get the sense that both her decision to stay with bourne and her later decision to leave involved genuine inner conflict  in the one quasilove scene she provides all of the sexual spark in her seduction of bourne who midway through the brief scene seems finally to recall what sex is  julia stiles agent should be fired for allowing her to play this bit part with no real connection to the story  she has one line that begs for some kind of dramatic flair  instead of delivering her line in the manner of a scared communications agent about potentially to be killed by a rogue agent she asks its bourne isnt it as though he were dropping by for teathe biggest problem with this film is not the acting  its the script which spares the viewer the inconvenience of tidying up its loose ends it introduces the plot as good actionthrillers generally do that is with snippets of important characters in already developed situations and vague hints that their interrelationship will eventually explain the genesis of and real issues involved in those situations  but we are never really given any idea why the characters want the things that they want  we know that there is a deposed leader making trouble for the cia we hear of an expensive agenttraining program there are headaches  but we never get any welldeveloped sense of how they connect  the list of plot problemsholes is endlessthe ending is thoroughly disappointing  the explanation of bournes amnesia is almost silly and absurdly foreshadowed earlier in the film  the gun battle at the end is boring  i did learn something though  apparently if you get on top of a dead guy you can plummet anywhere from seven to ten stories without incurring much in the way of injury the end of this film is unique in the actionthriller genre precisely where you would want it to conform  there is no real woostyle action grand finale,intelligence
to be completely honest i am not a very good film critic i go into movies with the hopes that i will be entertained not that i will gain an entirely new worldview out of watching a large screen for two hourswith that in mind this was an excellent film i went into it with high expectations because the idea was one that could have been taken pretty far and the idea was taken far at least far enough for my tastes matt damon gave another convincing performance proving to me that all of his appeal is not wrapped up in the fact that girls think he is hot franka potente was also excellent i was somewhat surprised that she spoke english so well wasnt she the girl in run lola run anyways the only character that was horribly miscast was julia styles wow that could have nearly ruined the movie for me she was just so very wrong for her part  apparently the people who cast her were under the impression that matt damon being in a movie made it a teenage chic flick the only kind styles is suited foroverall this movie was very well made and i would have given it a 10 if not for yea  8510 ,intelligence

rescued by a fisherman near the french coast the young man matt damon is utterly confused by his condition not even able to remember his own name he is further shocked by the two bullet wounds on his back by his sudden ability to speak numerous languages and by his swiss safe deposit box where he hides a gun several fake passports and stacks of money from multiple nations the subject of an aggressive international manhunt the young man is widely persecuted yet his instincts soon reveal physical combative abilities that repeatedly secure his escape constantly on the run a chance encounter with marie franka potente from run lola run proves troublesome as she compulsively decides not to leave the fugitives sidetries to create suspense by assigning its character the difficult mission of piecing together evidence that may reveal his true identity and bring back his memory while simultaneously establishing the convenience of being assumed dead by his enemies however when dangerous enemies discover jason bourne is alive and launch their searches the plot degenerates into a series of persecution scenes that sacrifice further character development in favor of thrillseeking action in this manner the films most valuable players ted conklin and the professor find no truly meaningful place in the film the most extreme case of lack of character development however is seen in julia stiles nicolette whose role as conklins secretary is limited to functions that are inconsequential to plot such as answering phones and taking notes what a waste yet s greatest flaw results from the films ambition to exploit its main characters extraordinary physical abilities to escape danger as it inappropriately assigns almost superhero attributes and produces unintended awkward comedic effects all in all although does establish an extraordinary problem amnesia for its extraordinary hero a secret government agent the film fails to explore more intriguing narrative possibilities regarding the psychological effects of its characters identity crisis,intelligence
for those ludlum fans that are going to see this movie do not expect it to be about carlos  there are only a few similarities between the movie and the book and i can tell you them without giving anything away1 jason bourne is the main character 2 jason has amnesia 3 jason runs around europe with a woman he meets after losing his memory 4 a government agency known as treadstone existsbeyond that the stories go apart from one another  some people will notice that he find a bank in zurich  howevertaking it is a movie not an adaptaion of the book it was entertaining and worth seeingfurther information below on why it is not an adaptation  i think universal just wanted the name recognition and the ludlum estate knew it would increase sales dont read on the remainder has plot information  in the book jason is a made up assassin that is created to bring carlos the worlds number one assassin out in the open to be arrested or killed  in the book jason is not a government assassinin the movie jason is a government assassin  his sole job is to take out targets alone in a way that the us will not be tied to the deathcarlos is not part of this movie at all,intelligence
my opinion is slightly biased as i am a huge spy thriller fan if you can look past the amnesia and super spy scenario you will be into it damon is believable in this role in that he is not as much of a pretty boy as cruise pitt clooney yada yada the fight scenes are relatively believable but ill have to rent it so i can slow it down and see what the hell really happened they definitely sped up the film during fight scenes there were no fancy high kicks that in a real fight would leave you exposed sure it was a little thin on plot but action packed and suspenseful props to damon,intelligence
matt damon played a very 007 kind of guy in this movie thriller  it was a great suspense flick and if you can look past the klee shays its easy to find yourself gripping the movie theater seat or the persons hand you went with   matt plays jason bourne a man who cant remember who he is yet he has all these terrific fighting skills  the fighting scenes in this movie rivaled those gladiators and them  i was very impressed  has matt damon been practicing to take over the aging peirce brosnan  the girlfriend he has is great run lola run  also the chief is really convinving as the man who wants to get matt damon  hes played be col fritz of american beauty  all in all a good movie  dont try to figure it out too soonand dont expect to have a few questions answeredjust sit back and watch matt damon deliver the goods as he has in every movie he has been in so far,intelligence
has things going for it as far as direction goes acting and even some action sequences but the problem with the film in a closer inspection is that it has all really been done before  youve got the assassin on the run from his former employees and he tags along with a woman whom he just metonly twist here is that the assassin matt damon has amnesia and cannot remember who he is  thats the most original thing about the movie and it gets its entertainment from there but the movie has the incredible cliches that come with a movie that does not have the amnesia twist in the story line  when it gets to the end the movie seriously goes on autopilot airplane stylei liked the performances  its always nice to see chris cooper play the antagonist and franke potente is cool as always but what is with julia stiles  i didnt even know she was in this movie and i can see why  she doesnt do anything  she answers and transfers some calls  thats itmatt damon proves to be a good action hero here but something a little more original would do better justice  even director doug limon proves he can handle the genre well but this hardly does for action films what swingers did for relationship comedydo i recommend  on its entertainment factor yes  i wasnt bored while watching it so its a good cheap seat movie or if youve seen everything else  other than that go see the brilliant changing lanes again,intelligence

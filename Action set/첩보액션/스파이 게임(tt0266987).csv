i made the mistake of only watching this film once the first time around i did end up buying it though i was never sure why then years later i got around to watching it again and again and again while is so fastpaced that its difficult to keep up the first time around i think thats what makes it such a great dvdthere are performances in this movie that defy description you almost get a sense that if you were to meet him in the street youd get someone named nathan muir playing the part of robert redford  the transformation is that complete in several scenes but especially the scene on the berlin rooftop redford gives a performance that is unlike almost anything ive ever seen in cinema its that perfect brad pitt also does an amazing job but redford steals the whole moviei had to rewatch three times before i felt i got a complete understanding of everything going on there is almost nothing given away for free in this movie  none of the standard hollywood shoveitinyourfacesoyouresuretogetit fare every decision most plot points and a lot of what would normally be called meaningful looks are written on muirs face for a split second then theyre gonethis is one of the few movies thats intellectually challenging to watch it takes patience and a quick assessment of each scene to understand and keep up none of the acting is over the top or explicit most everything is controlled subtle and delicately handledall in all is an exceptional movie imo to watch and in some ways to study,intelligence
i cant believe some of the nonsense ive read here people are complaining that redford looked too old in the flashback scenes  for one i thought he looked believable secondly hollywood hasnt cloned redford in a vat yet so well just have to live with scenes like this so get over it others complain that the movie is somehow boring which blows my mind considering its nonstop fast paced action and dialogue if youre attention span is too short for this movie im sure youll enjoy crap like xxx others complain about messy plot logic how did a cia operative get into a chinese prison huuu duhh i dunno its a popcorn flick you morons its not a 900 page novel or a documentary the plot takes a few leaps here and there but a snake eyes or faceoff this film is not i read complaints about the arty flashy mtv style editing and filming techniques  i actually thought the movie was filmed and edited superbly and the contemporary tvcommercial style actually complemented the film its crisp tight taut and entertaining you get the feeling this is a highquality production whereas with something like mission impossible 2 the same type of style is implemented but it comes off feeling cheap not here not with this movie as with enemy of the state it works i have a feeling some of the people that thought it was boring simply couldnt follow what was going on the plot does make sense if you have the attention span to keep up,intelligence
is everything were not supposed to expect from a major hollywood movie engrossing intelligent well written acted and directed  but thats just what it is and more this is definitely the best thing ive seen since memento  although pitt is really good and redford plays himself as well as he has in years i think the most credit should go to tony scott in the hands of a lesser director this could have been something more like mission impossible  but scott stays right on target keeping us interested developing the characters and keeping the pacing nearly perfect  scott also shows us that hes stayed with the times he employs the full array of modern camera tricks like fast motion reverse zooms and funky lenses but in a way that actually makes the film better instead of being an annoying distraction  the dialogue feels natural all the actors do good work no one tries to steal the show or be the star  the story is interesting and almost never lapses into the kind of hyper violence or sappy sentimentality one has come to associate with modern studio pictures  you get a feeling this is pretty close to how the cia really operates a place with fantastic technology at its disposal but whos ultimate effectiveness is determined by the fallible people who run the missions and take the chances  i really enjoyed this film i hope its a sign of things to come and not a rarity,intelligence
there are many reasons why we like a movie or not for me this is the case in witch small things were enough to like it the two main actors the places in which the action occurs and the fact that it has more to do with a love affair in a tragic atmosphere than about spies well of course this is about spies  two of them  and mostly about the relation between them if they are similar enough to understand each other they are also different enough to generate some tension in the relation maybe this is more about how the characters move around each others than about action or intrigue in fact this is so obvious that the way in which the story is told is mostly in flashback with muir robert redford introducing all of them and narrating part so the story is the story and the is what muir does within the cia in 24 hours or so the distinction is important because if you think of this as a traditional spy movie maybe like the bourne identity or supremacy it has two obvious flaws for the genre the plot is very simple maybe predictable and theres no bad guy no one to kill or to revenge theres also almost no genuine action and as far as i can remember bishop brad pitt only fires one weapon in the whole movie maybe what mislead most of the people was the title of the movie and maybe thats why most of them didnt like it however in my opinion this is a very good movie with strong leading roles and a compelling story no gadgets no arms no villains no actionoh nothis is a whole different game and its a serious and a dangerous game the game of people and their relations,intelligence
will probably never be considered among the best spy movies to come out of hollywood however it is a really entertaining movie with quite a few surprisesthe movie is set in the early 1990s nathan muir redford is a retiring cia officer who learns that his former protg tom bishop pitt has been captured while attempting a prison rescue in china and will be executed shortly cia brass want to know what motivated bishop to attempt this unauthorized action and they interview muir to find out muir tells the story of how he met and trained bishop from vietnam to berlin to beirut while muir is setting the background he is also working secretly behind the scenes to free bishop will muirs cloak and dagger antics be discovered before he has a chance to free bishop overall the movie is not as good as other spy genre films such as three days of the condor spy who came in from the cold or hunt for red october i think redford does well in the role of the retiring slightly jaded cia officer muir pitt does well with what hes given though i think his character suffers from poor writing especially near the end of the film think of as a more sophisticated mission impossible thats no knock on mi and youll be pleasantly surprised,intelligence
 2001  out of fourtony scott is known for his big budget fastpaced actionpacked extravaganzas his latest film is no exception he takes advantage of a massive budget but loses sight of human comprehension its difficult to grasp his moral when its awash in a superficial style where individual shots seldom last more than thirty seconds and where dialogue never exceeds the length of a short paragraph theres not much time to introduce characters situations or even locationsdatelines appear on the screen to identify times and placesyet it doesnt just feel as if we are in another movie by tony scotteverything feels very real the danger is real the characters are real many action films are about the action special effects and car chase sequences does contain those things but they are in a focused tight evocative thriller this movie is about the characters not the action it never forgets that contains a complex structure we begin in 1991 veteran cia officer nathan muir robert redford prepares for retirement on his last day he learns that his onetime protg tom bishop brad pitt has been captured in a foreign prison on a charge of espionage and will be executed in 24 hours fearing international crisis the cia decides it would be too risky to save him but with a new generation in control of the agency nathan is no longer an insider he must outsmart his own agency in order to save his old friendmost of the film plays out in flashbacks as the cia digests valuable information from muir the movie spans from the vietnam war to the end of the cold war with years ranging from 1965 to about 1991 although the characters dont seem to age much we learn nathan chose tom as a sharpshooter in vietnam he trained with bishop they formed a close bond until something came between thema womanthe fortyyear span in time poses no problem for the engaging screenplay by michael frost beckner and david arata focuses on only the necessary characters the soundtrack by harry gregsonwilliams masterfully captures the various time periods spicing the scenes with a slick sense of style and intrigue the cinematography by daniel mindel makes the differences in location clear christian wagners editing gives the movie a frenzied almost rushed emotion that puts us right in the middle of the race against timepitt and redford retain their ground despite a thick style redford creates a character out of nothing we know little about him at the beginning and we know little about him at the end but he somehow gives his character a conscience human values and a lot of interest we care about him because we do not like the black and white cia operatives thus we care about pitts character as well pitt gives his character an immature nature he is in a stereotypical young hotshot role that might have fit him better a few years ago but he still creates a grave sense of panic and fearwith a structure like this we expect subplots to evolve from the flashbacks there is an intriguing terrorist story a love story themes about betrayal trust position friendship commitmentbut never slows down and allows us to absorb these important details by the end we feel exhilarated and we know we just watched a very smart wellcrafted film but the most we can take from it is that it is a very smart wellcrafted film i think beneath all the style and surface there is a little more to the movie than that,intelligence

top notch thriller engrossing though typical plotsubplot two men develop friendship woman comes between them but buddy helps out and saves couple and great character development considering characters are supposed to be mysterious spies and very little is told about their backgroundrobert redford is a cynical yet warm mentor and brad pitt is a hotshot moralist as well as being the best assassin in the business redford is an oldschool operative who uses his tradecraft to outwit the technology the modern cia now relies on to bust his protge out of a chinese prison after pitts character a rogue agent uses cia resources to rescue his girlfriend fails and ends up in prison himself facing execution in less then 24 hours for being a spy  the relationship between the two men is told in a series of flashbacks that span a timeline of about 20 years starting during the vietnam war to the cold war in berlin and the mean streets of beruit as redfords character stalls for time during a debriefing into the rescue failure on his last day of work before retirement in the meantime between breaks of debriefing he mines for information about why the cia wont save one of their own as well as setting up a covert operation to get pitt and his girlfriend out of prison before they are executedcinematography is reminiscent of brother ridley grainy washedout imagery in tones of brown and blue and editing and camera movement is more like recent films from woo or ang lee the action is realistic without being over the top there are no fancy gadgets or impossible stuntscompared to stuff like xxx or worse xxx2 mission impossible 1  2 or any number of action thrillers about secret agents such as the most recent crop of james bond films or charlies angels this movie seems to tell it the way it is or the way you might think reality might be the tradecraft actually makes way more sense then say a watch with a laser cutter built in or a car with missiles an ejection seat all in all a very watchable and believable film,intelligence

when a well planned mission goes wrong and tom bishopbrad pitt is held prisoner in a chinese prison  cia calls nathan d muirrobert redford on a day before he is to retire to throw some light into the situation muir had been bishops mentor and had trained him as a spy so the story is told by redford as a narrative he narrates how they came together carried out missions together and ultimately parted their ways twists and turns assured in this cleverly written movie  the part where redford trains pitt is simply superb the chemistry between the actors is greatthe movie is a two hour entertainment nothing more nothing less,intelligence
tony scott brings his love of the old school genre of espionage films as casablanca to the modern and contemporary from everything to his locations in morocco to the actors he cast to the way he framed the shotsrobert redford proves true to life that he is still the best as old school cia spook nathan muir  bringing the superbly well crafted script character and dialogue by michael frost beckner to life brad pitt delivers what in my mind is one of the best performances of his career showing just how good an actor he goes from the cocky self assured and extremely skilled sniper tom bishop to the tom bishop made hard by his experiences and conflicted with his feelings catherine mccormack brings the heart to the film as the exact opposite of bishop and muir driven by her feelingsthe story is well crafted with excellent and smart dialogue inspired by true to life intelligence operations is a film that will be as one of the titans of the spy thriller genre ten years from now along with confessions of a dangerous mind and traitor,intelligence
ok so it makes me sick as a guy to watch another brad pitt movie granted but this one makes me forget that its pitt that im watching he does an excellent job of appearing normal and not star struck robert redford is excellent in his ability to draw you into his character and wonder what he is thinking throughout the movie redford is even better at appearing smart and witty than he was in 3 days of the condor both actors have charm and a flare for making simple situations more complex witch adds depth to the moviethe flow of the movie is smooth and has a lot of dialog witch i love the doublestorysimultianity is very smart and entertaining the story between brad pitts and redfords past and the current story line of redford working against the government and trying to save pitt from execution the plot isnt spoon fed to you so it leaves you guessing as to what is going on and which way the movie will go but at the same time it gives you enough information that you dont ever get confusedthe cinematography is very entertaining and not boring the acting of the government employees was excellent and very believable the scenes of redford talking with the officials is very smart and captivating as you try and figure out what is going on in the heads of all involvedover all this movie has good light action good plot smart and entertaining actors smart dialog and good cinematography if you like spy government conspiracy light action actiondrama movies brad pitt and robert redford than check out this great film,intelligence
you can find a lot of pairs of contradictionsto me the most touching battle is the one between the soft part of their brad pitt  robert redford heart and the iron rules of the glad their heart won outwas also relieved to see in the movie how we earthlings might be after all more than machines although i still like the poignant remark by kurt vonnegut tralfamadorians of course say that every creature and plant in the universe is a machine it amuses them that so many earthlings are offended by the idea of being machineswhile getting the job done usually means human beings act like machines following hard rules feelings have to give way to interestwhile the redford underestimated the feelings of his boy scout to the girl the cia antagonists underestimated redfords feelings for his own horse so it goes,intelligence
one of the very best of spy movies that i have seen and i have seen a lot  i mean a lot the soundtrack the music the locations the story line the acting the direction the photography the whole general feel of the movie is absolutely brilliant everything in it is greatrobert redford and brad pitt dominate much of the storyline and i gotta say that they are both amazing in it and frankly their acting caliber is unquestionable the story is great and told brilliantly it moves at such a break neck speed and so coherently that you are captivatedits nathan muirs robert redford last day at langley hes woken by a friend in hongkong to find out that tom bishop brad pitt his protg an agent he trained has landed up in a chinese prison and is marked for execution in 24 hours for being an america spy with dwindling resources time running out a committee trying to declare bishop a rogue agent and very skeptical colleagues muir has to save bishop,intelligence
tony delivers something i would have expected from brother ridley  a set of images about imagesthe photographic and editing style is one of successive photographs often shiftedzoomed with the shutter click some black and whites many color deprivedthe heros cover story is as a photo journalist and his photos are shown the same as the cias redfords recollections and the narratorsthe agency is primarily about images in real life images and action and thats selfreferentially played up here scott uses a style of zooming in and out by jump cuts that he developed on his last film  also about images and the intelligence community lots of cameras and binoculars herethe dramatic action is global involving several hotspots with lots of action when viewing that action the cameras are handheld when watching the calm controlling scenes at headquarters we see them more statically as they are being videotaped often spying through blinds spy  see often the images have digital tagssome of the field scenes with redford and pitt are shot as though from a spy plane as in that swooping sweeping shot on a roof or if interior as seen through a holelots of helicopter shots and lots of helicopters it seems every combination was employed among the following ground interior of heli interior of second heli front of heli heli pov above heli this by itself is selfreferential when you notice how many of the ordinary shots are from helisthere is also a clever selfreference in the casting pitt was hailed as the new redford when he appeared in thelma and louise by brother ridley then in river runs he was directed by redford in a redfordlike role underscoring the relationship here he also is mentored but in my opinion outacts redford at every turn i believe scott intended to use redfords limits as a tired actor to the advantage of this reference pitt has been working hard in relatively minor but challenging roles and the results showthe only real complaints are the clumsy plot mechanics the last day before retirement  a clear 24 hour to doom clock  a wily and complete outwitting of the pencilnecks  all the cia analysts and technicians as outwittable dimmies  a senior character says get everything we have on so and so and 10 seconds later a secretary appears with the files in multiple copies  a helicopter is shot down it disappears behind the trees and then we see a fireball fortunately we gloss over all that stuff couldnt in enemy of the state,intelligence
is a great twist on the usual james bond type of movies about spies there are no cool gadgets no handful of dirty women to sleep with no amazing cars to drive around in fact most of the movie takes place inside an office as nathan muir robert redford tells a story about tom bishop brad pitt and himself when they used to do spy stuff together between vietnam and the collapse of the berlin wallgreat plot interesting turns in it and both redford and pitt play well together i especially like how nathan takes tom under his wing like a father figure while he teaches him everything that he knows about being a spy there is quite a realistic portrayal of the violence and death that is involved with that field of work as well its not as glamorous and cool as most movies make it out to bemy only complaint about the movie is the fact that bishop who supposedly serves as a sniper in vietnam under the command of muir looks exactly the same age forty years later during the current event timing of the movie he doesnt age at all and it was very noticeable and annoying while i was viewing the filmoh not sure what was edited out for the tv version other than some language but the original has language and content to make it rrated fyi the tv version wasnt bothersome at all,intelligence
this is what an intelligent and entertaining spy movie should look like and i dont mean the superspy genre with its gadgets and sly wit in contrary this is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes in short it revolves around a young cia agent pitt who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved mccormack from a chinese prison he gets captured and will be executed a few days later 24 hours before the execution the cia learns from his capture and a presidential visit and trade talks ahead decide to burn the rogue agent they contact his recruiter and mentor redford to fill them in on the young agent this he does between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his proteg free the plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks redford uses in his scheme are simply great the fine scene from clear and present danger where ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming the directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing but mostly in scenes where there is action unlike many other movies using these methods here it enhances the film instead ruining it i regret watching the otherwise great movie man under fire speaking of action if you expect an action packed spy movie like the forementioned clear and present danger youll be disappointed the only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers first vietcong later on us marines and is only mere background most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense the acting is very strong especially redford and pitt which seem to have developed a great chemistry having worked together before may have helped but redford definitely dominates the movie his scenes are more than intense and when he unpacks his most dangerous weapon his smile in the scene when the nasty superior thinks he has nailed redford it is most memorable i think this is one of his strongest acting summary if you read and like intelligent thrillers from authors like forbes le carr or nichols you might already have devoured this gem of a movie and if not go and get it,intelligence

it is refreshing to watch an older robert redford pitting his acting skills against a younger brad pitt in this spy thriller movie both of them acted very well despite the sketchy plotto me the storyline is pretty straightforward a retiring cia operative nathan muir robert redford learned that his protg tom bishop brad pitt had been arrested in china as a result of a botched rescue attempt of his girlfriend he was due to be executed shortly because of vested interests cia refused to mount a rescue out of friendship muir engineered a successful but unauthorized rescuethe entire movie is beautifully choreographed through black  white flashbacks  pure dialog during which muir recalled his personal encounter  close friendship with his protg that relationship spanned across a time line of about twenty years from the vietnam war in the 70s to the end of the cold war in berlin during the 80s  then to the mean streets of beirut in the 90sthe movie moves on to show how muir had taught bishop all the skills or dirty tricks of spycrafthow to case a restaurant fix a radioto be callous look at the big pictureto stay remoteto sell out people if thats of useto killthere is no typical highoctane action sequences in this spy thriller movie except for a heartpounding escape scene in a china prisonthroughout the movie one can see how muir had to use his wits  all the skills or dirty tricks he had learned while working for the cia to outsmart the cias top echelon as well as his fellow cia operatives to mount a personallyfinanced rescue missioni really enjoyed watching his brilliant machinations as he moved from scene to scene in the movie i just loved the part where he juxtaposed cia satellite images to fool his bosses he even forged the signature of the cia director at the end of it all of them apparently did not have the slightest clue as to what was happening  had happenedon the whole i have enjoyed watching this spy thriller it is also comforting to know that an accomplished singaporean actor adrian pang had a small role in the movie he played a medic during the botched rescue attempt,intelligence

i think someone called this an intellectual action film and that description fits it it is the first film ive seen where dialogue alone kept me breathlessly waiting to discover what happens next i first came upon this film on a cable channel when it had been on for about 10 minutes there was redford sitting at that table with his cia confederates and i could tell this was going to be a very different kind of movie i knew that i would have to follow every word spoken so i shut it off checked when it would be on again which was three hours later and watched it from the beginning its that kind of story line you cant afford to miss the nuances that accompany the dialoguei thought it was fantastic and watched it again the next night and if i ever break down and buy a dvd player it will be the first film i purchase operation dinner out,intelligence
its going to be short because i wont reach a hundred words including this opening i like not because of the music or a single theme or character neither is it the story by itself or the way it is spread before us its not just the cast or the way the play in this movies and lest us forget what they do in other movies its not even the way it all rhymes together into something great entertaining and intriguing its because all of the above combinedthanks for reading i enjoyed writing it,intelligence
tony scotts is a kinetic yet heartfelt espionage thriller that sees the director maintain considerable shards of his assaulting sensory overdrive of style whilst pausing along the way for a story that is really rooted in the personal story of the bond and friendship between two men a lot of his films are predominantly visual and auditory a bullet train of sound and fury with plot and characterization as passengers onboard here those elements are cogs in the machine resulting in a very touching extremely exciting outing and perhaps the directors most overlooked piece robert redford used to be the younger more naive faction in a lot of cinematic pairings especially with paul newman here he flips the coin taking on the grizzled mantle of both father figure and mentor to brad pitt pitt is tom bishop an operative taken under the wing of veteran agent nathan d muir redford nathan no doubt sees some of himself in the lad and takes a shine to him grooming him with all the skills and cunning that a lifetime in the business has given him life throws curveballs though and more often than not they involve love bishop has gone rogue in an attempt to rescue relief worker elizabeth hadley the brilliant catherine mccormack who needs to be in more movies from a chinese prison in his eagerness he is captured leaving muir to make some tough decisions pull some hidden cards and use all of his talent and resources to extract them now in many films like this there would be several blistering action set pieces to show how its done scott instead chooses to give redford the intellectual grit and subversive genius to pull hidden strings and come up with a wicked fun solution that is endlessly more satisfying than an explosion ridden shock and awe campaign his struggle to get his friend back is laced with flashbacks of his training with a 70s flavour that feels authentic and writing that lovingly builds the blocks of their dynamic stephen dillane provides wonderfully understated work as a quietly smarmy cia prick and watch for a quick appearance from the great charlotte rampling to see scotts frenetic aesthetic hired for a script that takes its time and plays out less like a conventional thriller and more like the paced elliptical spy thrillers of years past vaguely reminiscent of aspects of le carr is a somewhat rare treat terrific thriller with redford at his best highly highly recommended,intelligence
from tony scott the director of crimson tide true romance and top gun comes a character driven thriller which is more of a friendship story than anything elserobert redford stars as nathan muir a midlevel cia operative who on the day of his retirement discovers that his old proteg tom bishop brad pitt has been captured and imprisoned in china on the charge of espionage muir assumes that bishop will be claimed by the us and returned home safely but that is not the case as the us is in a pivotal time in chinese relations and claiming bishop as their own would strain ties with the chinese government so the cia headmen decide to leave bishop to his fate muir resolves himself to save his friend at whatever cost while muir tries to deceive his colleagues we are shown in flashback how muir and bishop became allies and then friends through their covert operations and about the woman who came between thema complex plot no not really the movie explains it all at a perfectly understandable pace the film is mostly a spy thriller and most of the action scenes are shown in flashback they are still fantastic when they do come around though and probably most importantly you dont feel your backside numb in between them as the drama and deceit featured between is nearly just as exciting which is always a plusthe direction by tony scott is top notch as is the cinematography and the music by harry gregsonwilliams who delivers a score which is easily his best redford and pitt both excel in their roles and are well supported by stephen dillane and catherine mccormackprobably the best aspect of this film is way it bounces back and forth in time to showing muir and bishops up and down relationship we start in vietnam and go all the way up to 1990 and it is handled beautifully yet people still seem determined to pick this film apart for plot holes strangeall in all its a well crafted stylish and engaging dramathriller with some memorable moments great directing good acting and a fabulous scoreunderrated here on imdb 810,intelligence
good storyline all the excitement love and angst you would need in a film redford is at his best a step ahead of them all pitt delivers as well looking good in every scene i recognized catherine mccormack immediately from braveheart great movie watch it,intelligence
loved this movie unexpectedly complex characterdriven spy tale of a wily master spy about to retire after thirty years on the job and the final challenge of his last day with the company redford and pitt were fascinating and believable the cast of supporting characters was perfectly cast from larry bryggman as the older spywhocameinfromthecold to the new faceless agents bound to their desks with no understanding of what it takes to win the game really a great story i dont know why i am always surprised that brad pitt is such an affecting actor but i was particularly blown away by the job he did in this film good stuff,intelligence
although the timeline of the movie was slightly incoherent the story kept moving and was never static  there was a right balance of action and explanationso basically good movie  i recommend it d,intelligence
my generation grew up playing one or another  it was the time of the cuban missile crisis and francis gary powers  spys were cool  one of the first grown up films i saw was dr no  my favorite tv shows were i spy and mission impossible  its no wonder that i loved this movie of course having ordinary bob redford another utah resident in the lead role didnt hurt  and having brad ive loved his work since seven pitt in the colead spot made it even better  the script was fun the dialogue tight and the cinematography was superb  im more than thankful that there are directors and producers around who are willing to let a story evolve and expand  the hack critics are all saying that is was convoluted and impossible  funny havent read that complaint about the harry potter flick  finally the harry gregsonwilliams score will have my foot tapping for days  great flick,intelligence
clever plotting terrific screenwriting great filming good music i enjoyed this more than i expected and i expected a lot brad pitt and robert redford must have started salivating the minute they saw this script i rarely get this jazzed up about movies anymorebut all the angles came together in this one the chemistry the casting the filming and the story a terrific film,intelligence
outstanding actionfilled tautly wound spy thriller a sophisticated plot against a backdrop of cia operations from berlin to beirut to china you leave the film fully satisfied and feeling you have real insight into cia operations and thinking including a set of values which leave the players themselves confronting the inevitable ethical dilemmas of using and being used betraying and being betrayed,intelligence
despite a few inconsistencies and contrivances s is one of the better espionage films to hit the streets in quite some time  the story is intelligent the action is brisk and the suspense tauttony scott orchestrates the project well perhaps overdoing the musical element a bit but pacing well and creating an effective weave between flashbacks and current day events  yet there are a couple of areas that bothered me  first muir robert redford was consistently developed throughout the film to be a hardened leader always looking at the big picture and following the imperative regardless of the human cost  so his rogue operation to save bishop is completely out of character  not only is it difficult to believe that the cia would have been fooled by some of his deceptions it is hard to swallow the fact that he would have risked everything to pursue a rescue that was antithetical to his training beliefs and personality  it is also difficult to understand how bishop was allowed to stay in the field given his penchant for disobeying orders and his continual development of emotional attachments to his various human assets  such recklessness would never have been tolerated because it would have endangered him the assets and would have potentially compromised whatever mission he was working on  however i suppose i need to cut the writers a little slack or otherwise there would have been no storyrobert redford turns in an excellent performance giving muir a very hard edge and cunning mind  brad pitt proves to be an effective action hero this is the kind of role in which pitt shines playing the dark rebellious character that lives by his own code and gives in to no one  catherine mccormack also delivers a credible performance as the humanitarian aid worker playing both sides of the street to get supplies for the disadvantaged action lovers will enjoy this film as will those who like a mentally challenging story  i rated it 810,intelligence
this was a great movie the acting was solid the action scenes were well made and the suspense was fantastic if you are looking for a plain out good movie then go see this one it will keep your attention and never let down,intelligence
excellent thriller with new millennium alist star brad pitt teaming with 70s alister robert redford smartly casted in a buddy picture after pitt took direction from redford in his memorable yet underappreciated a river runs through it from 1994 in an entertaining spy film directed by actionobsessed tony scott which will have you at times on the edge of your seat scott rewards his action hungry audience in calculated doses as the picture is laced with lots of intrigue and second guessing including a clever use of flashback sequences for additional suspense to this international thriller catherine mccormack is appealing as the love interest for pitts character which goes beyond obligatory since the joining of the two conflicts with his mentors guidelines for espionage survival the chemistry of all the players along with scotts exciting action input make this an above average pittredford buddy flick,intelligence
told in flashback centres on the relationship between cynical senior cia operative nathan muir robert redford and his proteg tom bishop brad pitt the movie begins almost at the end with the capture of bishop following a failed rescue mission in a chinese prison this sparks a crisis between the usa and china and as tensions escalate between the two superpowers muir is forced to reveal all he knows about bishop to a cia committee from their early days together in vietnam to beirut where bishops relationship with a mysterious aid worker elizabeth hadley catherine mccormack leads ultimately to his capture in china on the final day before his retirement muir must call upon all of his negotiating skills and intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the cia to find a way to free bishop before he is executed although redford and pitt receive equal billing this is really redfords movie he is the focus for the complex plot and pitt appears mostly in flashback redford is the best he has been in many years and is well cast as the ageing cia warhorse who has seen it all and done it all pitt is reliably good but does appear as if he wishes that his character had a little more to do still its a very adult movie with a topnotch cast pitt must be one of the hardest working actors in hollywood he has appeared in what seems like every movie in the past year or so including snatch the mexican and oceans eleven tony scott top gun days of thunder of thunder confidently handles the complex plot and the subtle relationships within the cia as the men at the top struggle for power ultimately shows the battle between loyalty friendship and yes love against betrayal and treachery muir attempts to make up for a lifetime of politically motivated deception and killing with a final act of selflessness he uses his retirement money to attempt the near impossible rescue of bishop from the chinese prison where the us government seems determined to abandon him one of the main lapses of is when redford is supposed to be 25 years younger in a flashback segment in vietnam its a sad fact that no amount of makeup aviator sunglasses and 70sstyle sideburns can disguise the fact that he looks just as craggy as he does in the present day the camerawork uses the stilltrendy wobblycam it probably suits the journalistic thereasithappens style but after a couple of hours its a bit hard to take is an aboveaverage spy thriller that isnt the usual american gungho view of war and instead attempts to uncover the behindthescenes manoeuvring and backstabbing within the cia as it intervenes in various world conflicts rated 710,intelligence
redford is great in this someone swept up by circumstances into something he doesnt want to be involved in and surrounded by people that dont understand the rules of the game  i think this will end up with the same cult following as three days of the condor  it has the same feeling to it  unfortunately it has not had any staying power at the box office i will see it again in a theater if possible and get the dvd as soon as its released,intelligence
excellent movie  not the best of the year but well written tightly edited and well paced  the setup is 1991 with redford talking in well paced and edited flashbacks about events from 1975 to 1991 involving the recruitment and training of cia agents  worth seeingespecially notable is the depiction of the us deference to mainland china china has some very successful and bright talented people along with huge numbers of working poor who suffer under the yoke of a nominally communist unless capitalism suits their bottom line government  americas utter dependenace on low priced goods from china has colored our foreign and domestic policy  in order to keep the goods flowing we ignore chinas many human rights violations an abusive labor climate that we made illegal at the turn of the last century their border incursions their contest of the spratly islands their communism their repressive laws their shocking justice system their nuclear weapons and their avowed interest to have enough ships and planes to move a million man army anywhere in the world it wants by 2005  we treat them with kid gloves give them most favored nation status for trade and ram them into the wto all for the sake of cheap goods to keep our discount stores and electronics firms rolling in profitin 1927 us marines invaded guatemala in order to protect the interests of united fruit  foreign policy was bent to the will of the industrial rich to ensure a flow of goods so they could keep making money i believe that with china it will not be us invading them but rather the reversealong with the exploration of this bit of politics s is also notable for its characters underhanded dealings with one another who watches the watchmen  i thought the script was well written and well thought outthe sets and locations viet nam berlin beirut etc were excellently put together and well filmed  there was a senes of realism and the chaos of an embattled city like beirut was well shown  i thought the editing of the film between the flashbacks and the present were strikingly well handled and showed that american viewers really can handle non linear plot lines if they are handled correctlylike several recent films at two hours plus this one went a bit long but not too long  i was keyed up for most of the film and it never seemed to drag  the film just consumed a lot of time with the detail which works for this film  with a lesser script the film could well have draggedits a go see  not a must see but if you need a good spy thriller about now and were as let down as i was by tailor of panama what a dud then go catch this one before it exfiltrates,intelligence
frankly the 70 average rating is a gross annoyance because 71 is the minimum for imdb to classify it as liked so i only just got around to seeing it and only because i couldnt find anything i hadnt seen in the genre with a higher ratingfact is that this is one of the best spy films i have seen it keeps your attention from the getgo well worth seeingalso it has a rich mix of intrigue action politics spytechnicality you name itcould it be that the genre as a whole is just too complicated for the average reviewer possibly looking at some of the other ratings for top spy films,intelligence
redford and pitt make a good film that much better they both have a presence that comes out of the screen at you a good story line which kept me interested throughout the film which at the end made me feel well satisfied that i have watched a very entertaining film the rest of the cast gave fine performances with each one perfect for their role especially the cia members i was impressed with scenes set in beirut  the action scenes were well directed and compulsive viewing  violent but restrained and gave me an impression of how the people of lebanon are manipulated by the west a very good film  well worth watching and would highly recommend to anyone who likes a simple good thriller with two of the best actors around,intelligence
robert redford introduces us to the yes a game one that you do not want to loose as he informs a newly recruited brad pitt you go from the last days of viet nam and the phoenix project to the middle east back to the us and red china the sets the directing the supporting cast oh did i forget the sound track this is one of the best little nuggets in this complex and very clever movie great score and sound should of got a little golden boy but what does the academy know is not the first time they blew it and it will not be the last i do not want to spoil it for you so i will just stop here and say rent it borrow it but most of all you have to see it is very solid entertainment which was somehow overlooked at awards god only knows why,intelligence
is there anyone from china writing reviews about how nonsense details they have in the movie the script writer and even the whole crew need much much more homeworks to do i mean geographical details at least i knew that the script writer wanna to set the coincidental maps between bahamas shore and east china coast shore but youd better put the amrican military base in okinawa japan there is no base in penghu taiwan and okinawa is shorter flying to shanghai and they need to set the prison site at tilanqiao prison in shanghai the suzhou pirson is far inland of china i do not think that the helicopters can fly over the shanghai airdefense zone unless you cut all the power grid of eastern china rather than only suzhou cityits the year of 1991 why there are so many cultural revolution slogan on the prison wall which had taken place in 60s70s do you think its the graffiti wall in a bar and the accent of those chinese actor are cantonese not standard mandarin it might be not easy to find a group of chinese actors who from mainland china to speak the local accent or mandarin as i guess i believe that there might be no one knows about it to the western audiences and the movie crews they are all the same and those uniform of prison guards is big farce the crew might not know the details too i do not want elaborate more on thisthe van used in the film in suzhou prison then used the same van in beirut lebanon i do not think you are short of budget which then you can rent several helicopters to film and the scence that all prisoners knock their rice bowl on the cell fence togehter that only will happen in american movie it doesnt look like china at alldespite those weakness which i do not want list them all i also want to say its standard and good hollywood movies though no big mistakes on other elements of the film from this point of view the only way can explain all this is that the u s film industry or amrican hoi polloi have little knowledge about china even they want to work hard on it so i also begin to doubt about american movie that depicts middle east russia and africa then its all your own imagary pictures of them,intelligence
tony scotts quick cut shorts and varying camera speeds are a trademark of his movies it suits nicely to stories like he tells the story in a fast manner but with more incidences which sometimes bores usi always felt more scenes like training brad pitt and recruiting him in vietnam and germany are just added to fill the frames of tonys fast moving rolls but the fantasy in getting on last minute by redford to save his exrecruit is quite interesting the subsequent actions add pace to the film and finally when redford uses his life savings for everything its too touchingthis story paints the inner conscience the completeness of ones life and feelings of a man for another and tony handles this quite nicely worth seeing itmy rating 710,intelligence
you should expect a few anachronisms and factual errors in any film set more than ten years in the past but this movie is completely full of them from beginning to end and it was made not even ten years after when it was set thats the first howler the berlin wall came down in 1989 not 1992 where do we start with the rest if brad pit had been a tasty young hunk in 1992 how could he have also been a hardened assassin in viet nam probably before hed had time to have been born how come the folks in beirut were chatting on cellphones in 1982 years before they were available in the rest of the world and when a car phone was literally that a phone that required a car to move it and what about the natty 2001 style thin monitor computer on the agents beirut office desk then what about the gigantic ten year gap in the plot between brad characters girlfriend being caught and his going to rescue her which is presented as an act of passion not only did it simmer well but she looked not a day older after ten years in a chinese prison then that rescuewho but an idiot would imagine that a p3 in the cia has the authority to authorise an act of war on china and if they did only two choppers and clapped out 40 year old old hueys when the usmc have been flying black hawks since the eighties a stupid error made all the more glaring by the pilot of one referring to his machine as black hawk one oh i geddit they are the same two hueys they used in the viet nam scenes or maybe they are meant to be the same two hueys that appeared in those scenes you see i dont know in a film this full of temporal wormholes anything is possible or maybe they should have spent more money on hiring choppers and less on the ridiculous overblown soundtrack with its tiresome clichs comprising plaintiff choirboys and arabian vocal pirouettes and a clumsy abuse of themes from vaughnwilliamsas you may well imagine my only reason for sticking to the end of this film was to see what more howlers were in storeit seems to have been written by a twentysomething with an absolutely shameful and absolute ignorance of anything before the present it is an appalling indictment of this director that he would put his name to such a thing,intelligence
the most interesting and remarkable part of is the opportunity to observe how much brad pitt resembles robert redford in his much younger days  the rest is a fatuous and banal waste of time i saw it on a transcontinental flight and had no choice but to suffer through itthe movie seems to have been thrown together simply as a vanity piece for mr redford who walks through the very familiar role of the renegade cia man reluctantly forced into doing good and outsmarting the bad guys at the cia of course  banal devices such as locations and times printed across the bottom of the screen to accompanying urgent typewriter sound effects cannot save this b movie from the drastic holes in its plot and outrageously farfetched scenarios  mr redfords character looks remarkably the same in scenes supposed to be thirty years apart vietnam in the late 60s and ultimately during his final days before retirement from the cia in the 90s  brad pitts character does not appear to age at all from a young sergeant in vietnam about 20 years old to a cia contact employee who would thus be at least in his midforties during the films setting in the 1990s the films producers and directors seem to be of the opinion that movie fans there to see posterboys redford and pitt will overlook the preposterously flimsy storyline and lack of any coherent plot  pitts characters training as a cold war cia operative appears to consist of nothing more challenging than a series of fraternity initiation pranks i want to see you get in that building and standing on that balcony in fifteen minutes redfords tweedjacketed cia far east analyst strolls through the cia headquarters making secret calls on his cell phone on his last day at work and cleverly arranges for an armed attack inside of a foreign country with a hand forged paperapparently without any consequences or international reprecussions to serve his own purposes remember how agitated the chinese got when one of their jets crashed into that us surveillance plane  what do you think theyd do if armed helicopters and soldiers attacked an installation well within chinese territory the ostensible romance between pitts character and an english social worker is pivitol to the plot but is barely addressed  poorly conceived and badly written is as idiotic as it is inept,intelligence
i tend to disagree a little with the critics on this one yes i agree with most that the camera and the editing utilized are a little to modern for my taste as well they are too hectic but that doesnt diminish the overall value of this motion pictureso why did i find this film to be good well mainly because it is very realistic except for the ending but you cant have everything it pictures world events and the operatives in them as they are crude and ruthless decisions are made based only on interest as is the case in real life robert redford does an excellent job of portraying an experienced read cynical cia operative who doesnt hesitate to use people and play with their lives whenever necessary again as is the case in real life because spying is a brutal and unforgiving trade where only the strongest survive its not a charity where manuals need to be followed to the letter like most seem to think nowadays  no wonder the results of the western intelligence agencies are so pitiful recentlyjudging from the reviews and user ratings though for most of the moviegoing public this realism was a big drawback because people do not want to accept cruel truths nowadays they do not want to accept the fact that in order to be free someone has to do the dirty work for them they just want everything in life to be neat and spotless in other words politically correct well this movie is everything but that and thats why i liked it,intelligence
tom bishop a us spy has been captured while trying to infiltrate a prison in china his mentor and man who trained him nathan muir is called in urgently to work it is his last day before retirement to help unravel a potentially volatile international situation during all of this muir thinks back to the days when he trained bishop and how he turned a soldier who fought with guns in the battlefield into a soldier who fights with wits and deceptionmany people seemed to pan this film and it didnt perform well at the box office but it is nonetheless an engaging thriller it is perhaps the fact that this is not an action movie as many were led to believe as the word spy in this movie is much different than say james bond the approach here seems like a story out of robert ludlums books with movie based more on the characters and plotting rather than all out spectacle it shows international espionage in a way that it probably is in real life a web of deception lies trickery with bursts of violence here and there also suit with that point the world of espionage isnt really all that glorious especially when you take into account that the heroes are among other things assassins they work for a government they have their personal issues like any other person but they are essentially to do some very dirty work not the most respectable type of human beings but thats the point spywork is dirty work however the ending rings of hollywood more than the rest of the movie would like it toalso tony scotts likeness for visual experimentation seems to have started around here it is not quite as insane as domino but the constant flashbacks and themes of deception are played out nicely under scotts often hectic direction  810rated r for violence and profanity,intelligence
this film does so many things right it is not easy to follow but ive seen it three times now and each time it gets better because the plot is so tight and the performances are so realistic and intense there is lots of witty dialogue but it doesnt come off as trying too hard because its all consistent with the way the characters are developedi guess you either like tony scotts cinematic style or you dont unlike other favorites of mine he has done like true romance and crimson tide this movie is told in a nonlinear way  ie lots of flashbacks but the thing this movie does that makes it so effective is keep a basic central story line  a cia home office inquiry into a rogue operation  going while around it in flashbacks we see the development of the two central characters in several substories leading up to the present day situation sound confusing okay it is but for those who enjoy being challenged in movies like the usual suspect it is very satisfyingso sit back pay attention and dont get discouraged its a wonderful intelligent action movie and it will make sense at the end oh and look for david hemmings who steals each of the few scenes hes in,intelligence
for me the key to a great spy movie is an exploration of the moral ambiguity of spying the bbc dramatizations of the john lecarre  george smiley novels are the epitome of this genre is about as close as an american movie has gotten its a little faster paced a little more action adventure a little more high tech but at its heart it asks why be a spy is it worth it brad pitt does fine robert redford is wonderful the aging pretty boy actor with talent as a mentor for the up and coming pretty boy actor with talent is an unavoidable subtext to the spy handling spy plot of the movie and the pacing of tony scotts direction keeps the suspense alive throughout a layered script that explores personality as much as it moves the story along top notch all the way,intelligence

the latest film from veteran director tony scott crimson tide enemy of the state and the modern classic top gun and screenwriter michael frost beckner who wrote the soso sniper and the horrible cutthroat island is one of the best spy films in recent years scott shies away from fullblown action here instead building tension through longtime cia operative nathan muirs aptly played by robert redford assessment of an old pupil tom bishop brad pittbishop recently the film however is set in 1991 imprisoned after a failed mission is due to be executed at 8 am est muir is called upon to give intimate details of bishops life to among others cia suits troy folger larry bryggman late of die hard with a vengeance and charles harker stephen dillane muirs main adversary why so important the united states and china are due for trade talks the very day bishop is to be executedmuir and bishops relationship is detailed in flashbacks from their first meeting in vietnam in the early 1970s where bishop fresh out of hemet california is a rookie sniper with three confirmed kills after bishop survives vietnam he moves on to west germany as a clerk until muir in a chance meeting decides to introduce bishop into the world of espionage in a fine touch bishop learns from the wise muir in a cornucopia of imagesearly on bishop learns the thin line between the world of espionage and real life during a mission in berlin muir later tells him on a rooftop if you go off the reservation i wont come after you as the film moves on however muir learns that bishop may not be worthwhile to the cia and may not be rescued thereby enlisting the help of his secretary gladys marianne jeanbaptiste friend harry duncan david hemmings and others to save his friends life the real story lies in 1985 beirut when bishop undercover as a photographer meets elizabeth hadley catherine mccormack a londoner working as a relief worker in the wartorn city though their relationship is never truly founded as we would like this is muirs story and not bishops this however ultimately hurts any true growth of bishops character redford then makes muir shine it is in beirut therefore that makes muir change his mind about saving bishopthe flashbacks especially vietnam and beirut are wonderfully captured on film by cinematographer daniel mindel who also did scotts enemy of the state scott fleshes out all the supporting characters nicely though yes this is redfords film highly recommended to those who enjoy the likes of tom clancy 810note as a san diego padres fan i must point out that there is a goof in the film i have notified imdb of this also in beirut in 1985 bishop from hemet california near riverside is wearing the blue san diego padres baseball cap with white and orange lettering this is an anachronism the padres still wore their brown and yellow uniforms in 1985 and didnt replace them with the blue white and sometimes gray uniforms until new ownership in 1990 the brown and yellow cap is not hard to find,intelligence
finally a thriller that really is smart and action packed redford steals this movie not the least because hes in practically every scene hes seasoned by time in the sun and it fits his character he plays an essentially duplicitous cia agent with such charm that we of course convince ourselves that he is just a patriot doing his job its vogue again to have the ends justify the meanspitt gets all the action stuff and little to do in the acting department but thats allright hes pretty he also gets to play the moral character who doesnt like people being treated like pawns even though he does itthe beirut sequence hits very close to home and is probably one of the more intense action scenes in any hollywood movie weve seen this before from people like depalma but after 91101 were not just casual observersdiscerning eyes will notice that practically all the actors save our intrepid heroes are british ooh secrets and lies ooh masterpiece theater after years of neither side being able to pull off a decent across the puddle accent we are now in an era of being unable to tell the nationality of native english speaking actors its such a glorious ride that i didnt really mind the improbable ending which if it had happened in real time would have been an act of war and in case you havent noticed the lecarre irony now has a patriotic edge,intelligence
s is a slick if improbable thriller the story is told in real time with flashbacks to fill in the details of robert redfords and brad pitts connection in the game of espionage the flashbacks prove insightful and absorbing however it would have been interesting to see a few more of their international cloak and dagger escapades but that isnt possible since redford is working behind the scenes on his very last day as a cia case officer as he relates these tales to his colleagues hes actually working against them since theyre working against his old comrade in arms this is ironic since redfords character said to pitt in an early flashback to never help another only look out for yourself given that these flashbacks are the product of redfords intentional bias its likely that he never truly believed this as he was in fact doing his best to help pitt in his own way how redford goes about helping pitts character is one of the most intriguing aspects of the film while improbable its still fascinating redford shows he can still act a great part since we know from his facial expressions that hes thinking four different ways simultaneously this is what makes the film so absorbing it would have been interesting to know more about what pitts character had done since parting ways with redfords so many years ago we have an idea of what brought him to china but we dont know exactly what role or to what extent redfords character played in his being there or the contacts he obtained once he got there but no matter what ensues is an absorbing spy thriller certainly on par with redfords three days of the condor which is the antithesis of in the former redford played an innocent who had to learn the quickly  under the unexpected tutelage of a more experienced spyassassin played by max von sydow who was actually out to eliminate redfords character however in redfords character exhibits all of the knowledge a seasoned cia operative requires and exercises his knowledge expertly without any need for a tutor the dichotomy of the two films makes just as interesting to watch view it if you like a good espionage thriller 910,intelligence
an incredible movie youve got to watch it over and over to get all the subtleties plots and subplots its not easy to catch all the nuances but once you do everything falls in place not the best of acting from redford and pitt but seriously what would you expect but they pull off enough chemistry to make this an excellent partnership there is great drama an intelligent storyline and a little bit of romance thrown in i would recommend you buy and not rent this movie cos it just gets better with each viewing its funny how tony scott is somehow so inconsistent i loved top gun at least at the time it came out and crimson tide is one of my alltime favourites this certainly belongs in the top,intelligence
watchable and at times entertaining but instantly forgettable and with some glaring plot holes and inconsistencies that really annoy the viewer  eg brad pitt and robert redford are implied to be of the same age also there is no attempt to change either actors features from the flashback to 1975 to the presenttime in the movie 1991 neither of them are supposed to have aged at all in 16 years i think this movie would have been better too if it had spent more time in the 1991 scenario rather than disappearing down so many dark corners comprised of flashback scenes310,intelligence
what is wrong with some of you people hollywood feeds you the same crap over and over and yet you gobble it up indiscriminately just the same1 robert redford is friggin 65 years of age for god sakes no amount of soft lighting is going to change that2 use some goddamn makeup if we are to believe that brad pitts character was back in nam he shouldnt look exactly the same many decades later3 just because redfords character is old school shouldnt mean that all of his new school superiors should be posed as complete idiots4 i neither give a damn about the cliche of pitts character risking it all for a woman5 nor do i give a damn about redfords character coming to the realization that hes become emotionally hardened by the and should make an attempt at redeeming himself6 flashbacks are rarely a convincing plot device hence dont use them7 this film creeps at a snails pace8 mr scott we already saw all of that amazing but frenzied aerial camera work in enemy of the state 1998 there it was creative and useful here in its just silly and distracting9 in all i found so totally uninvolving i was ready to walk out the theatre after the first 20minutes too bad i didnt610,intelligence
tomy scott here making it clear once and for all that he can be equalled with his brother ridley the style of filmmaking the use of music and the editing seems to me like very much alike and that is not a bad thing at allthe film itsekf is very exciting even while you know how it will end before you even begin to watch the movie so to know the end end still make an exciting fil is quite a piece of art robert redford seems to get beter and beter by the time he is getting older and brad pitt is not so much in screen as you might expect another interesting actress was catherine mccormac who we know from braceheart although her appearance was not as beautifull i was still surprisedand then final a note for the amazing music the soundtrack is one of the most beautifull i have ever heard and when you put on the cd the recording is another thing to rave about this film surely is carried by the music,intelligence
hey i like spy and action movies as much as the next guy but this movie was pretty badif you were to assemble a list of the top 100 hollywood cliches you could probably find 99 of them here it goes on and on with improbable scenarios and that horribly annoying zip around fast forward scene change technique oh and that cliche boys choir soundtrackredford is way too old for the flashback scenarios how about a little makeup for those i doubt there were many 75 year old operatives in vietnammore plodding and inane plot devices twisted it from a potentially good story to an overdramatized tale of inept bungling maybe its real we hear a lot about the cia bungling everythingall right its not a total writeoff but im pretty sure you could find better things to do with your time than watching this,intelligence
the scott brothers amaze me visually they have true talent and they know it they have even made good wellrounded films but many of their films are also all flash all gloss and no substance i went into this film with high hopes but i finally found the movie tedious redford gives another solid performance and i have to comment on another post  someone gives redford crap for looking old and weathered hey he is old and weathered give the guy a break i give him credit for being secure enuff to say  hey this is what i look like god bless him for not having the bad face work that every other star has he looks like someone his age who has been in the sun so what hats off to him and his real facebut once the film gets going its just redford telling these flashbacks and they go on and on andspoilersmaybe this is what people liked but i didnt in the long run pitt goes to all this for a girl so you strip it all away and its a love story ho hum i just found it to be a mess where the twists and turns work out only because the movie allows them to work out everyone at the cia is stupid and redford is so smart that beat is played over and over and scott loves to show off look at what i can do with a camera wheeeeeee i can circle a building top really fast and then look  i can slow it down now im gonna swoop that gets boring really fast,intelligence
if you are into the espionage movies would be a good one to see it goes into some details of how the cia really works and some of the secrets behind it  it is a very fast paced movie which makes you pay attention the whole time but with robert redford as nathan muir a cia agent on his last day and brad pitt as tom bishop one of the very best the cia has it isnt that hard to pay attention to the 2 hour movie robert redford trained pitt to become a very good agent and put him under his wing  with that came a friendship between them that neither ever forgot  redford is notified that pitt had been captured in a foreign country trying to pull off a prison break  redford now has 24 hours to find a way to get pitt out either by lying stealing or manipulating he must do it  it being redfords last day on the job he is risking it all to save a friend he dearly loves that he has lost contact with within the two hours you will notice the love that has grown between the two  when redford gets his first glimpse of pitt in a vietnam camp you can see the sparks almost right away  robert notices that pitt is all by himself and that he volunteered for the army  redford figures that he isnt going to be any good but is shortly proven wrong which really changes his mind about pitt  in one special scene redford is willing to do anything to save his dear friend  just by his facial expressions you will be able to tell that there defiantly is some love between the two friends  all of the friendship being displayed through out the movie reminds me of proof of life one thing that really caught my eye in this movie was defiantly the lighting  when tony scott director wants you to notice the friendship between redford and pitt he will make it known with the lighting  when first meet in vietnam pitt enters the tent and sees redford sitting there scott perfectly places a halo effect on pitt to make sure that we realize there is something there  he does this many times and makes it certain that we take notice to this all in all this film is an okay movie that must be seen  after coming out of it you will notice that a friendship is a strong bond that can withstand anything that is thrown at it,intelligence
i love this movie  its one of the biggest surprises in awhile  and one of bobs best movies since the naturalspoilersnow of course there really isnt any spoilers in this movie since its a movie that shows some of the ending already not the endingbut its a great flashback movie  it does have alot of senseless writing though  and its not really believable  but i loved it1975 and 2001  bob shows his age in both times  he hardly looks younger in 1975  if they can make orson welles look older they sure as hell make robert redford look younger  bad marks for the makeup deptthen theres some military crap they goof up  who in blinds eye is gonna get an operation done with a fake signature  its kinda scary if you think about it  theres also some plot holes lurking aboutnow ill have to see the last castle710quality 510 entertainment 1010 replayble 1010,intelligence
the one thing that i admire about robert redford is that he plays characters close to his real age in he is cia agent nathan muir who is about to retire  on his last day he learns that his former protege tom bishop brad pitt has been placed in a chinese prison and is about to be executed muir against the wishes of his superiors plans to bring bishop out the relationship between muir and bishop is detailed in a series of flashbacks  how muir recruited and trained bishop and how bishop develops a relationship with political activist elizabeth hadley catherine mccormack which eventually leads to bishops imprisonment muir while appearing to appease his colleagues and superiors is calling in a few markers from his contacts around the world in an effort to secure bishops release redford wrinkles and all is the consummate con man once again as muir who wont leave his friend in jeopardy brad pitt is also good as the cocky young bishop who like muir has his own way of doing things reminds one a little od three days of the condor 1975 another cia themed redford film but this time with redford on the inside,intelligence
muir and bishop meet in vietnam in 1975 and the present scenes take place in 1991 thats only sixteen yearsseems to me way too many people are freaking out because the characters look the same throughout the filmi personally think bishop looks much younger in the scenes in vietnam as opposed to the present time of 1991 meanwhile redford has looked the same wonderfully rugged for years so why should his character age so dramaticallypitt and the character of bishop are different people  just because pitt was born in 1963 doesnt mean bishop wasfiction people fiction the film is brilliant its supposed to entertain so let yourself be entertained and pay attention to those small details that people work hard to get into a film before you throw a fit about continuity,intelligence
i always love tonys moviebecause it made me feel that the storys in the movie are based on real thingsafter i saw the movie i lost that feelingsee the su zhou in the moviea dark disgusting place with evil peoplei can assure you that mr scott had never been to su zhou the most beautiful and oldline city of china and now a new hightech industry basesee the prisonlike the navy depot in the movie the rocki tell u something in china jails are not such kinda staringthings the coolest movie i have ever known was under a lake anyway  the movie is exciting and worthy to watch,intelligence
its strange seeing these two actors together one gets the feeling that in redford you see an old brad pitt and in pitt you see a young redford which is exactly what the producers want us to observe but if neither of them were the great actors they are we wouldnt care less you must suspend your belief for a time when theyre together in vietnam because practically 18 years on both of them look exactly the same other than that its always good to see the good guy make fools of the rotten evildoers in this case the cia but if for nothing else just see it for redford who is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of his generation a master of subtlety and pitt matches his every frame of the way in this film as in oceans eleven brad pitt is so natural and so unaffected he makes you wonder what he couldnt do before the cameraas for the story its exciting standard spy story fare satisfying for sure and tony scotts got the goods as far as directing goes a little too close for comfort to enemy of the state but if thats what you like why not,intelligence
its a lucky thing this being a spy thriller about a guy brad pitt whos utterly wrong for the job hes doing the movie forms a perfectly inverted analogy for the miscastness of its director tony scottmaybe somewhere the script for this convoluteathon about the relationship between an older amoral cia hand robert redford and his young still ethically stinging protege pitt could have worked the movie has a nice offhandness about the coldblooded tactics of the company in various destitute foreign landsit tries to reassure us that crimes are committed for the greater good then it questions insistently whether that good is greater no problem with that the problem is that tony scott thinks hes still in crimson tide or enemy of the state territory digital speedups of helicopterd cityscapes slammin freezeframes of redfords nervous face blam 234 pm loud music and quintessentially scottian images of sweaty malefic underlingsthey all get in the way of a talky potboiler with an oddly literary undramatic unactionmovie structure it all takes place in a cia boardroom with redford recounting the pitts progress in flashbackhad scott just gone with the headiness of it all the movie might have had some of the emotional sting of say fred schepisis adaptation of the russia house instead he tries so hard to jack everything up that you have to concentrate twice as hard just to keep up redford gives a nice wry smart understated performance and pitt though under heavy wraps here no longer seems at all dumb which is a plus but scott who at least permitted good performances in movies like the hunger and true romance doesnt do his thespians any favors here you get the feeling there as much in the way of what hes after as theyd be in a michael bay movie like his much less talented colleague joel schumacher scott is somebody who keeps seeming to want to grow up but never has the huevos to take the leap,intelligence
was redfords second bomb in 2001 the first being the completely unwatchable last castle  judging from redfords performance in both these films it really might be time for him to concentrate full time on directing really this is an awful awful film  the kind that makes you grab anyone who liked it and shake them until they get some sense  the worst among many of ludicrous sequences is naturally the ending when the us essentially invade china kill a bunch of chinese soldiers and free a guy who  lets face it  had no business being there and was totally guilty  and to think some folks on this board call this the thinking mans action film uhhuh,intelligence
puhleeze  this movie is so boring i had to fast forward through the whole thing and give up in the end robert redford is a fine actor but the story is so pathetic it generates no interest  cia assasins are just not the heartwarming people they user to be dont waste your money on this drek,intelligence
may be labeled as a thriller but its really a dramalove story brad pitt plays a spy who ends up in a chinese prison facing execution in 24 hours so its up to his mentor itsmylastdayatwork redford to try and get him out this is done sitting in an office reminiscing on past events for the entire length of the filmthe focus of the film is not on spy training or even spy businessrather its a film about pitts doubt as to whether or not what hes doing is right how much fun is that to watch well it isnt its pretty damn boring im not a huge fan of flashbacks and considering that this film is essentially one long flashback its really hard to liketony scott tries to hide the fact that almost nothing happens over two very long hours with an array of helicopter shots fast editing and bombastic music it may look exciting but it isntthen theres the many illogical or more like really stupid plot holes that raises a lot of questions the film takes place over several years yet nobody seems to grow any olderyounger if youre a spy is it such a good idea to be talking about your job in public all the time how come that everyone at the cia are morons does robert my face is looking suspiciously tight redfords spy training only include sneaking a peek at top secret papers he does it at least three times why did the script have to be of the kind where problems are solved by constantly using suspension of disbelief hmm i could really use a satellite photo of a shoreline looking exactly like the one i want to steal but wait i just happen to have one lying here in my desk next to the money i just happen to need to bribe some chinese guys to cut the electricity on a couple of islands so that our choppers can fly in and raid a prisonthe ending also feels weird the entire film establishes redford as a smirking heartless assassin who in the end is celebrated with a choir singing on the soundtrack for getting his not quite so ruthless protg out of prison of course he also made sure that brads terrorist girlfriend got out after a couple of years in prison which was the right thing to do considering that he put her there in the first placeon the whole may look like a critique of the dirty work the cia does but scrape on the surface and youll find that they really justify and glorify their actions in other words its the same kind of propaganda as always on the plus side though its not quite as awful as the recruit 210,intelligence

this is nor a neat nor intelligent movie it full of clichs and wrong superficialities like the noir like steamsmoke in berlin thats more like a gangsterfilm of the 30s in chicago or new york the nonaging redford the endless repeated latin boy singing voice have you seen any emotions or development of bishop has he ever said something he thought had he ever had an emotional outburst or any emotion that would be appropriate to the situation any reflections any characterization any real conflict all the way morality didt play any matter but at the end of the film that seems sham any backgrounds any pondering everything seems designed only for the goal to have two heroes fighting against a system which has not even tentatively questioned once by none of themlike frank lovece from tvguide wrote extremely wellshot espionage thriller that might have worked as an oldfashioned guysguy movie if the guys involved had any real human personality and the espionage were actually thrilling,intelligence
ive seen this film a few times since its release and although i liked it a lot i never thought of commenting on it but today i recommended it with some enthusiasm to a friend who hasnt watched it and this prompted me to write here the things i said about the filmthat it is simply one of the best films made a great story about love honor principles and sacrifice compiled into a contemporary espionage thriller a brilliant plot and battle of minds that continues up to the last minute of the filmit is about how people who work in the intelligence community think and operate and about the dilemmas they are faced with when carrying out their job the conflict between their aims and principles and how all these are affected by the relationships and loyalties that develop between themsome concentration is needed to follow the plot and details however this what makes the film even more enjoyable no matter how many times you watch it with excellent cast great direction and beautiful soundtrack this film is a must for all those who appreciate these ingredients,intelligence

spy brad pitt gets captured by the chinese and handler robert redford has to fight internal cia politics to get him free before he retires  in 24 hours so far so good but to stretch the running time we get flashback after flashback about how their relationship started and what caused it to go sour which totally undercuts the tension such as it is moreover there are several ridiculous plot developments which drag the movie down in the end its an extremely simplistic story  friendship is stronger than the rules and selfinterest so much ado about very little and moreover the film is told in a fairly confusing way making it seem more complex than it really is redford is good pitt blah as always i really dont understand why this script was chosen for being made because it just doesnt have anything which i would consider appealing  except the two leads,intelligence

i must admit tony scott is one of the greatest action directors the film world has to offer he not only has the ability to push his actors but also create these amazing visuals that transport us deep into the setting of the film he has mastered the cinematography of nearly every picture he has done giving us these beautiful shots of the world that we may never see in our lifetime several of his films enhance my dvd collection like crimson tide and true romance but sadly will not while scott does wonders with the actors scenes and camera angles it is the story that is ultimately flaws this film the lack of coherence consistency and structure take this tony scott film and transform it into just your average hollywood spy film it had the potential to reach new levels and there were several scenes that i loved but i just couldnt believe the story let me explainmy biggest issue with this film was the lack of aging from our two main characters this film spans a timeframe of about sixteen years and throughout the course of that time neither pitt nor redford age director scott chose not to use cgi or younger actors for the parts when they were in vietnam so as the time progressed in the film our main actors did not this was a huge hurdle to overcome since i wanted to enjoy this film i did not see the mission where the discovered the fountain of youth so i can only assume that this was some bad judgment on scotts part redford and pitt should have aged more than what they did in this film allowing us to see the emotion and sheer force behind their eyesoutside of this point it was your average hollywood action film large explosions and violence countered with a sneaky sneakersesque style subplot overshadowed the plot pitt was nothing more than the muscle of the operation and scott gave us nothing to build more upon his character i fault the writer of this film i believe that the homework was done correctly just not structured correctly perhaps it was just me but i had trouble following some of the missions i realize they were necessary and possibly not rocket science but the scene with charlotte rampling made no sense maybe i missed a part that was crucial in some way but overall it just seemed like there was more jumping and fighting than actual plot i felt as if the love interest was randomly placed through the film i realize that pitt was not one to follow simple commands but i felt early on in this film that he would have the ability to walk away from a woman if needed suddenly went from smart espionage film to master has to fix newbies mistake this felt strange to me because throughout the film redford continued to speak about having the upper hand and not straying from the point yet when redford was faced to save his friend he did just that was he learning from his pupil if so it was not very well spelled out and a very weak pointoutside of the story director tony scott gives yet another beautiful film the cinematography is outstanding i loved the way that he kept us the audience in suspense as to what time it was and how much time they had to save pitts character the black and white flashes followed by the time were inventive and it seemed to work it kept me on the edge of my seat scott controlled this film and it was a pleasure to see that there is no doubt in my mind that he is the master of the action genre and that more scripts should be coming his way i hope they are more inventive than this outing and have at least a bit more meat on their bones overall i thought this was an average film i am disappointed because there are better than average films that tony scott has released i am ashamed to ask why this film was not one of them pitt was solely used for the purpose of his strength and to capture the attention of a younger female audience while redford was used mainly for his dashing good looks and to capture the attention of the older female audience once you realize this point than this film will fall into place i dont think it deserves more than one viewing but the cinematography alone was powerful enough to watch oncegrade  out of ,intelligence

this is a nice little thriller film starring robert redford and brad pitt directed by tony scott who loves to use technology all out however fails to be a great film this is a fairly interesting  if almost hopelessly complex  cia picture that gets ratcheted to the stratosphere by director tony scotts nearromantic infatuation with his own technical abilities you can more or less forgive him during action sequences even though truly gifted directors know how to shoot even those with restraint but scott films every scene no matter how routine as if hes covering the launch of a nuclear missile both pitt and redford are good and their similar appearance and look will not go unnoticed the soundtrack especially the main techno theme is pretty good though all in all a good thriller,intelligence
scotts game among spies is more thrilling as a desk job than it is on field split into two bits the redford part undeniably steals the show with a large margin whilst pitts sequences no matter how hungry for blazing guns or breathtaking chase sequences or big explosions feels like empty punches the dull execution is to be blamed along with a cheesy script that has managed to snatch in every good trick from such genre films and it is peoplepleasing but there is not an inch of art in this commercial cinema with cheap camera work that notions its existence of a b grade quality with a grade cast that are totally misusedaforementioned the ticking clock behind redford and his tactics that never fails to surprise us along with his every posture on the narration the writers have chiseled him in every step to be an impenetrable stature that is both easily absorbing and lethal he lives up to his game the performance of redford is quite convincing if not anything extraordinary his body language and eye does up the ante along with his sarcastic arguments that has a way out of every door pitt on the other hand has all the physical work to do in fact he never shines on screen on his own merit not only on performance but in character as wellhe barely supports redford he is often manipulated he is a hot head with no character development that comes off as a pawn staged to ooze sexiness on screen even though redford overcomes that limitation a porsche does boost him though has petty rules that is equally entertaining as it is incongruent even its last aspect of getting two stars on screen with an incredible chemistry fails poorly the sunglasses wont be enough,intelligence

this brad pitt and rob redford spy thriller directed by tony scott he makes this film one of the thirllers of 2001 and one its one hour 15mins it flies by as there was a time when cia officer nathan muir he play as wise character y redford and his wingman tom bishop played by brad they were inseparable travelling the world and tasting every thing it had to offer from vietnam to beirut in a profession fraight with danger and uncertainty muir and bishop forget an uncommonly close friendship but that was years ago now in 1991 on the brink of retirement from the agency muir learns that bishop has gone rogue jailed overseas on espionage and is scheduled to die in the next 24 hours muir decides to take on the most dangerous mission and personal mission of his life as bishop got sucked in to the one game that he taught he wouldnt get caught doing as he played the game but game got him instead as muir bishop finds out the hard wayoperation dinners out is a go go go go enjoy,intelligence
nathan muir robert redford is about to retire from the cia when he is given a tipoff that an old colleague tom bishop brad pitt has been captured and is being held in a chinese prison upon discovering that bishop will be executed within the next 24 hours and with the cia seemingly being prepared to do nothing about it muir takes it upon himself to do his utmost to get bishop freed within the 24 hour deadlineto all intents and purposes this is a fairly good actionthriller with plenty of tony scotts trademark touches quick and flashy editing some decent shootouts and explosions it isnt all style though and what you actually get here is a reasonably good story  its one that is welldeveloped and through redfords narration we do get to learn quite a bit about muir and bishop theres certainly enough here to become invested in the story one other positive with this film comes with muir running his own operation in order to try to facilitate bishops escape this in itself makes part of the story exciting and throws in a couple of interesting plot turnspart of the problem with this film is that it is a bit plot heavy and crammed with far too much exposition  whilst it all serves a purpose and nicely pieces everything together in the end i couldnt help but feel that a little trimming here and there wouldnt hurt its also fair to say that clocking in at just over 2 hours it is a little on the long sideredford and pitt are both solid here and they are both developed quite well as characters but the downside of this is that they arent given a great deal of screen time together meaning that they are never really given much of an opportunity to build up any kind of rapport togetherstill when the focus is on tony scott doing his thing and redford running his own operation the film rarely disappoints however when the focus switches to redfords narration it becomes a bit plot heavy and wearying and at times tarnishes some of its greatness,intelligence
a good movie for both redford and pitt  all along hearing robert coaching brad on dos and donts but seeing him bend the rules at willan unusual story but it was hard to pin down the time line for who was in prison why and for how long against the story being spun by robert in meetings with his new enemieswhen is a human asset expendable  history proves often when high stakes politics reputations trade and treaties are involved  this movie just put fresh faces some circumstantial twists and very good acting to some old plots   i would like to see it again just because i like it but also to understand the subplots better,intelligence
numerous other members of the imdb corps have already mentioned the sd padres hat that should have been brown and the baywatch booboothere are other factual errors that just make the film grate against me like the fact that the inmate is blowing bubbles when he was given chewing gum secretly i hoped it was red light  green light gum from mission impossible pitts hair is way way too long to be in a usmc uniform  there is redford who looks every minute of 65 is that his hair whether it is 1975 or 1991  at least howard stern used some agereversing makeup techniques in his life story movie what else made me say oh come on during this film  pitt could have any woman and he chooses little miss has issues  hands down the dish in the film is charlotte rampling she looks younger here than in the verdict and those are the little things admitted ultraliberal redford is making a movie that makes our government look bad and he stages it in the last years of bush 41 wasnt the whole world still rocking and rolling over desert storm in 1991  china had cooperated with the international coalition and refused to veto our use of force in kuwait  this movie would have been better set in 1966 when china and the us still hated each other,intelligence
do you have a difficult time with the concept of life as a game well spy as a game may help you answer the question whether life undercover would suit you tom bishop brad pitt takes his assignments seriously and regales at the idea that the lives at stake are only a part of a game nathan muir robert redford takes on the task of transforming this specimen to a spook with panache  but then were talking of brad pitt arent we the new redford pitt meets the old redford as the studentmaster relationship shows up on screen as well as in the story why do we love to see brad pitt beaten up fight club had him beating up on himself  he didnt walk away unscathed in seven either cinematography is this films strong suit the sound track builds suspense and keeps this film edgy  but its the story that keeps you engaged throughoutim a sucker for redford films and am hoping for the next to match his sundance role he reprised his all the presidents men tortoise shells for this film and came quite close to besting his previous performancesthis film has energy excitement and intrigue and is well worth the two and a half hour investment even if you dont like brad pittthe retiring cia agent muir is brought back into the game to beat the 24hour deadline on bishops life you will be taken back to the bad old days of the cia and nam where these two kindred spirits met muir takes bishop under his wing to east germany to the cold war and the wall to learn the tricks of the trade theres a synergy between these actors that serves this film well as you want them to  more than just survive  succeedyouve seen the trailers specifying pitt is the idealist boy scout shoot by numbers until hes reprogrammed to look out for himself when it comes down to you or your assets send flowers be aware of the information he discloses you gave them four pieces about yourself and only got one in return and lie with consistency and thats four lies youve got to make true the charm of a spy tale is the blur between truths from fiction muir identified several wives spanning his 30year career although he wakes in an early scene alone is nathan muir an anagram does muir really give it all up for his protg in the end i dont know but if he does ive got the title for the sequel ready to roll,intelligence
its not how you play the game its how the game plays you no truer words have spoken on this hard lesson of love lust and relationship thanks to we now learn there is another arena where players play  espionage and it involves three individuals robert redford  the player brad pitt  the played and catherine mccormack  the baitthe film opens with the capture of an espionage agent tom bishop pitt news of his capture reaches a retiring cia operative nathan muir redford his onetime teacher in a crossexamination by the cia brasses muir narrates the career profile of his onetime protg via a series of flashback sequences espionage looks exciting if bishops life is any indication  tremendous explosions people getting killed many heated arguments with superiors and sleeping with a total stranger a good director also helps and tony scott is to be commended for his visually stunning treatment of the sequences each is a riveting yet grim presentation of a day in the life of a spy youd think youre watching a fulllength episode in each sequence within 24 hours muir plays the biggest game of his life to rescue bishop after finding out that his mission was to rescue of all things a female prisoner elizabeth hadley mccormack who is imprisoned in china and whom bishop frequently sleeps with errr no they are not in love not really there are no exchanges of i love you between the twoshows that muir can still play the game very well even in his retirement if the movie attempts to convey that true love conquers all even in the world of espionage it is overshadowed by muirs playing ways scott needed a conclusion that does not ooze a romantic happilyeverafter schmuck to screenwriter michael frost beckners masterpiece so he had the leading spotlight on muir and in the process relegating bishop to a flashback character by downplaying bishops daring prison rescue little of bishop is shown after his capture except in the flashbacks and scott makes it clear that bishops own rescue is muirs design clearly muir is the biggest player of all he played bishop and the cia bosses though one would wonder if he played himself by spending his retirement savings to spring bishop and his partner from prison more importantly why would he even care for someone whom he no longer is on speaking and professional terms with for more than 5 years bishop as smart as he thinks he is never realizes that he is being played by muir and to a lesser degree hadley  no better bait than sexual temptation speaking of hadley her character background is unknown aside from a brief explanation why she had to flee london and her global charity service that is little factoid about her her presence in the film is clear to feed bishops sexual fix it seems that the only reason why he goes out to rescue her from a communist prison is so that he can bed her once more but wait a minute why is a woman imprisoned in an allmens prison look i know this is china and last time i checked the chinese do not practice coed housing but seriously mccormacks talent is wasted here she is quite alluring as bishops squeeze sporting a british accent but nothing in her performance stands out or is remotely memorable pitt on the other hand is a fantastic character actor he is in fine form here and works very well with redford in heightening the tensions between their characters and is very convincing in his own scenes too redford unfortunately is an old bag by himself he is clearly past his prime and would have been stiff if it was not for his cast members that shared scenes with him his best moments are with pitt though there are not many of them he is also good next to  who plays his secretary in his own scenes which includes 10plus minutes of phone dialogue he is uninteresting he is a little better when crossexamined by the cia brasses in the conference roomby the end of we see two types of espionage the field agent bishop and the executive spook muir the former profiled in flashback narration the latter by his real time activities it would help facilitate your viewing pleasure if you approach as a character drama film first and action film second expect just an action film and you will be played but remember dont hate the player hate the gamespellcasters level 6,intelligence
i have seen many movies dealing with espionage and went into this one thinking it would be entertaining but lacking a good solid plot this movie was awesomeit was not only gripping but had an intricate plot always wanting more i always thought pitt lacked acting skills but this movie brings them back to life is a must see for action and excitement,intelligence

my favorite kinds of films are the intellectual thrillers where you have to run mentally to keep up with the pace of the plot lest you be left behind  the kind of movie where you park yourself in your seat and skip the concession counter or bathroom visits  the usual suspects is one such example  is another  there is no melodramatic stupidity no wouldbe witty oneliners no unrealistic deus ex machina scenarios to insult the intelligence of the viewer  instead were treated to a brilliantly intricate series of events woven together by a very talented cast  robert redford should get a nomination for best actor based on his performance in this movie and im now interested in checking out other roles hes been in to see if they pack the same wallopdetails the events of a single day the last day of cia veteran nathan muirs redfords character career in the agency  muir discovers that his onetime partner tom bishop played by brad pitt has been captured in china during a covert operation and a large part of the movie involves flashbacks where he recounts his experiences teaching bishop the ins and outs of espionage  the best part of this movie involves muirs maneuvers against both time and the agency itself to save bishop from harmif i had an objection to anything about this film i would have to admit that the flashbacks do not show either pitt or redford looking a day younger even though one such recollection spans sixteen years  however this small detail is the tiniest of cracks in the tremendous wall this film representsi rarely see films in the theater more than once but am considering a return visit to enjoy once more  i doubt i will be satisfied waiting until its released on dvd in six months,intelligence

spoilerstheres some elements here that dont sit right with me misuses military resources out of guilt he risks marines lives just because he made a mistake this has the same sort of theme as clear and present danger i hate to admit it but the clancy film illustrated the government betrayal much better than this did danger paints an even grimmer comical even picture of the behindthescenes goingson of the cia but ryans actions are easier to get behind hes horrified when he finds out hes been organizing a secret military operation the whole time and moves to make things right immediately muir didnt give a damn about elizabeth hadley who he put in a chinese prison knowingly until his own man was put on death row a better ending would have been the cia stopping muir at the gate and arresting him just seems like he should have had to serve some kind of punishment the whole film condemns the methods the cia uses to achieve its ends which muir is the master of few in the agency ever have to answer for anything so his escape is symbolic even typicalwhich is why he should be made to answer for his last operation and those that came before but then were back to justifying the budget no downer endings allowed whether the visible hardly secret involvement of the cia in operation enduring freedom had any effect on is a mystery scotts direction a bit too much flash sometimes a scene doesnt need a moving camera trust the actors trust the audience for instance the scene shot atop the fujifilm buildingoverdone on the other hand there is some fine crosscutting action in several scenes in particular i remember the vietnam flashback scene where bishop is first used as a sniper by muir likewise the films centerpiece bishops race to get the doctor to the physical where hell poison the terrorist leader is flawless these are all shot selection and editing simple elegant filmmaking does successfully illustrate its point which is to ask can a human being ever be just a means to an end how important is the greater good in the face of sacrificing a person i wish i could give a higher recommendationgrade b,intelligence
this is a more thoughtful and intelligent version of so many films of its genre lately it reminded me of the taught and intricate spy films of the 60s and 70s though implausible in many ways the film stays true to itself without any glaring plotholes or nobody would say that momentshowever i still think tony scott is better at style than substance i wanted to feel for the characters but i couldnt i felt manipulated by the soundtrack you know when were supposed to feel sad they play the wailing woman music when were supposed to feel excited they pump up the techno it felt forced to me silence wouldve been better even more suspenseful8 of 10,intelligence
sorry i hate writing a one line summary  anyways this is not the action thriller i thought it would be  that said it was a very enjoyable psychological film with several twists and turns  while the ending is predictable thats not the point of the film  its all about character development and robert redford was outstanding  quick witted and sharp he dominates this film over pitt  not to say that brad pitt didnt do a fine job as the young brash but talented tom bishop  muir almost adopts pitt and you get that father son tough love feeling from this movie more than you would a buddy buddy flick  definitely worth seeing,intelligence
simplicity and chronology are two concepts of film that if well used can revolutionize a film on the other hand if they are misused they can create a dilemma in watching the dilemma which arose was that of either enjoying the film for what it was or critiquing the film for what it wanted to be director tony scott has brought is some truly great films such as top gun true romance and enemy of the state in this film his most ambitious film to date he weaves an intricate complex and seamless mix between the present and the past is told in a series of flashbacks that seem to progressively obtain length as the film moves yet some may say that the film moves very slowly robert redford stars as a cia operative nathan muir who in his earlier years recruited trained and created his protg tom bishop played by brad pitt the movie is set in the present and retells their encounters and now that the chinese hold bishop captive for espionage and a likely execution muir does everything in his power to set him free the catch is  muir is on the brink of retirement and is almost helpless to save his young boy scout there is much more to the film than this simple synopsis yet the rest is entailed in complex issues unrealistic cia access scenes eg the authoritative forged document and overused speed up shots that try to set up a scene yet serve as nothing more than a repetitive and tiresome editing technique the films concept is quite ingenious yet the manner in which it is presented may to some be quite irreverent we have a film here that attempts to be something which it is not the films greatest weakness is the storytelling it complicates a simple premise and bogs it down in flashbacks and a slow second act which merely serves to set up the climax by placing both our characters in turbulent situations while bishop has only a couple of hours left until his execution muir is held by the cia in order to answer questions relating to bishops captivity and muir himself must scramble and orchestrate bishops rescue the film remains tight and tense especially with scotts still frame shots counting down the hours left until bishops execution  furthermore scott likes capturing elevated scenes with a helicopter using a wes cam shooting style that has our characters as the centrepiece in the frame while the camera speeds up and revolves 360 degrees in a manic mannerthat said it is a wellmade film that has some great moments and some truly terrific acting brad pitt seems to be maturing as an actor and is slowly creeping away from his studly image by coupling himself with some great actors and engaging himself in some great roles that display both his charm and his acting range as for redford he seems to enjoy playing a know it all spy who can outwit and outlast his oppressors as they seek for answers pitt and redford are fantastic together and although they do not share as much screen time as one would expect when they do it is well worth it the direction of the film is quite mtv  like and scott director ridley scotts brother is quite familiar with this style he employs some techniques brought forward in enemy of the state and he certainly knows how to make a film tense even when it is not supposed to be as aforementioned in the introduction there was only problem when viewing the film  should one rate this film for what it was or what it attempted to be unfortunately one must look at what was presented and not what could have been tries hard to be a different kind of spy film it is not a full throttle action film nor a thriller nor a drama it is a combination of all three that seems to be all over the place and cannot be content on settling into one genre furthermore it relies on a romantic subplot that pits pitt against choosing his job or his love also as mentioned earlier the storytelling is quite demanding that will bog down this film in key times yet it still is a fresh piece of film that will retain ones attention if not for the acting its visceral visual style that is reminiscent of steven soderberghs traffic upon the flashback sequences a beige sandy tint is employed to differentiate between the present and the past also during the war sequences in several war torn countries during the retelling a natural and unglamorized perspective is presented through its grainy look and raw editing and who can forget scotts classic slanted angle shots during the climax in cia headquarters further reminiscent of his crimson tide climactic sequences it is evident that scott presents us with nothing new except for a stylized story telling technique that unfortunately deters the film rather than ultimately saving itgiancarlos rating ,intelligence
has restored a bit of my faith in hollywood when i first saw the previews i thought this was going to be a james bond type of movie how wrong i was but how refreshing to see a spy film which does not glamourise the business the plot although at times incomprehensible due to my inadequacies was totally plausible the look of the film was very good it was a bit like watching a news bulletin  true to life and no farfetched heroics brad pitt whom i do not normally rush to see was very good in this but it is redford who is holding it all together the continuing scenes in the cia head office are very good many spy tricks are pulled off some which i had not previously seen in any other movies although not an actionpacked film the fast pace of the camerawork and a watertight script there wasnt any duff dialoguemake this a refreshing change from the norm an interesting thing was that the trailer as is so often the case contained quite a bit of stuff which wasnt in the final cut this helped because the stuff they cut out was the usual hollywood candyfloss pizzaz are they learning at long last that the audiences can still enjoy movies without needing contrived humour etc if is anything to go by then i would say they are i recommend this movie to anyone who likes real spies redford could get an oscar for this,intelligence
is a fine nights entertainment especially on the big screen although i did not find brad pitts performance particularly distinctive redford was in top form this film will keep you engaged throughout allowing you to forget whatever is going on in your real life for a couple of riveting hours however as much as my friend  i liked the movie we did find most of our postviewing discussion consisted of picking out farfetched and illconceived plot devices the beauty of this film is that it is fastpaced and engaging enough that you dont notice these problems while youre watching it only upon further reflection after leaving the theater if you like robert redford brad pitt or the spy thriller genre in general you wont be disappointed by this movie however if youre looking for a serious thoughtful movie look elsewhere,intelligence
movies for guys who like movies this film is tony scotts best film since crimson tide and carries a lot of the excitement that film had it is similar to james bondmission impossible only with much more depth this movie seems a bit too long especially for a action film  although 2 hours may not appear to be long the film could have fared a little bit better if the it was cut down a bit longer redford gives a the usual redford performance thats a good thing  pitt gives a decent performance as well but not one of his best 12 monkeys fight club snatch seven even considering he is not the main character one thing about this film that i found quite annoying was scotts use of the panaround and stopjerkquick zoomin as it also was in enemy of the stateif you like typical scott films you will probably enjoy this one as well its worth the 8 to see it in the theater you will leave the film satisfied,intelligence

the style of the movie was different than i expected but i think its probably the best thing about this movie the 24 hour countdown started before we knew who any of the characters were but they are well developed through a series of flashbacks i was a little turned off by this at first but only for a few minutes then the movie had my full attention pretty soon i genuinely cared about the characters played well by brad pitt and robert redford redford steals the show redfords character always keeps one step ahead of his cia buddies and i loved watching him do it the relationship between redford and pitt is a studentteacher one not fatherson one this works but i think the movie could have done with a little more of the fatherson thingthis movie is more of a thinkpiece than it looked in previews so anybody expecting brainless action will probably be disappointed i on the other hand was glad it was what it was certainly worth checking out 810,intelligence

robert redford refuses to be anything but charming in his movies we will never see him as the bad guy women want him and men want to be him give me a break alrightwas an entertaining movie but it had a lot of details and substories going on which left the audience a little lost at timesthe movie ended in a very unrealistic way they could have ended it in a very convincing way but unfortunately they didntthe story was a mesh of patriotism conspiracy theories love and war it was very confusing and had no message or meaningthe story could have been a great love story focusing on a man who leaves his duty to his country drops everything and puts his life in danger to save his womankudos to cinematography and sound they did a great jobproduction was great at times but committed blunders at otherssome of the characters who were supposed to be speaking arabic in one scene were actually speaking gibberish this could really offend some native arabic speakersi would give the movie a 6 for the cinematography and the sound,intelligence

its been just over 14 of a century since robert redford played a cia agent in three days of the condor cut down from the james grady novel six days of the condor and just as some have noted similarities between gene hackmans harry caul in 1974s the conversation and his edward lyle in enemy of the state the last film tony scott directed before i think that redfords joe turner a literature researcher for the cia in three days of the condor after surviving all the trials and tribulations there could easily have transmogrified into nathan muir of s  why not where else would a new identity be easier to createheres a quote from redfords joe turner in the 74 film you know you guys are amazing you think not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truthi didnt have a microcassette going to record at last nights sneak preview so i dont have any comparecontrast quotes although muir does say to one of his colleagues something to the effect do you remember when we could tell who the bad guys were but i think the character of redfords 2 cia agents are not dissimilarthe story is staged within a 24 hour period of time which keeps the tension up the story begins in the present and keeps flashing back to the past  then to the present again in cycles not unlike that in orson welles citizen kane  but in you get an onscreen clock and a location on the screen so you dont get too disorientedi dont want to get into a plot analysis im sure you can find that elsewhere i just have a few comments to make some of which could be construed to be mild spoilers so read on at your own riskthere are a number of times nathan muir gives advice to his protege tom bishop and by the end of the film he has violated every single one of his espoused principles this is a little humorous kind of black but still funny but it also tends to telegraph later actions there was also a scene in the trailer seemingly spliced out of the print that we had which has muir saying something about if you mix business with pleasure make sure the business comes first that time clock popping up on the screen was handy but it wasnt always there in at least one point assuming an evenness of time flow it seemed highly unlikely that a copy of a fax muir sent i believe internationally somehow appears wrinkledcrumpled in a cia briefing room with muir et al moments later perhaps i missed something somewhere  quite likely hey  its a spy film extraordinary things can happen but they should happen within a believable framework maybe its like people pointing out continuity errors in harry potter  hey  that films about magic  whos to say the characters didnt do the errors what fools these muggles be but i digressit was a fun film  no citizen kane but then few films are i thought redford and pitt worked well together i believe redford cast pitt for a river runs through it 1992 and the chemistry was there at that time also this screening was shown under the auspices of the film society at case western reserve university in strosacker auditorium  all 500 seats were filled and a number of people had to be turned away the audience seemed wellengaged and there was a fair amount of applause at the end you might want to go to a matinee or wait for a secondrun theatre but this film wont be the same on video or dvd  see it on the big screen,intelligence
this movie was not like the trailers tv ads for itit is a long boring movie with robert redford and a bunch of men sitting around a table for most of the movie there are too many flashbacks back to the past about redfords and pitts relationshipeventually i got up and refilled my soda becasue i was bored since this a mainstream movie expect a typical mainstream ending i predicted the ending of this movie at the halfway point if this movie did not have so many flashbacks maybe i wouldnt of looked at my watch often during the movie this movie is more of a heavy drama rather than a thriller the only action in the movie is in the beginning and endother than that its mostly men talking around a table interviewing redford if i fell asleep i doubt i would of missed much in this moviethe trailers and ads are misleading not a thriller but a long boring drama so if you like boring long movies see this movie otherwise wait for this movie to hit the cheap movie theaters or dvdvideotape,intelligence
this was absolutely one of the longest most boring movies i have ever seen i like dramas in fact i prefer them twelve angry men for instance is one of my alltime favorite movies i think they were trying to do something similar here with all the intrigue taking place between a bunch of men sitting at a table but they failed miserably there is no intrigue the plot is hackneyed and trite the acting is stifled and thats giving redford the benefit of the doubt the suspense is missing entirely if youve seen virtually any movie released in the last say fifty years then nothing in this movie will be a surprise to you its all been done before and much much betteroh and if you saw the trailer and thought this was an action movie then you will really be disappointedno matter what you were expecting i would say youre likely to be disappointed with this movie its sixteen hours of my life that i know ill never get back i think that in honor of this movie i may do away with my longstanding policy of not walking out on movies if i have to sit through another one like this i wont make it,intelligence
this movie is full of errors the director is either too lazy to do some research or think viewers are too dumb to realize the error the movie is set in 1991 but the cityscape in china is more like in 1919 the setting is said in city of su zhou but guards in prison speak cantonese their uniform is also wrong su zhou is an inland city but the satellite claims to be su zhou shown a coastline finally i guess a thirty years vet of cia would know better than make such a move just before us president would visit china,intelligence
i have watched twice now with a gap of six years between viewings i felt that maybe i was a bit harsh first time around when the continuity errors really bugged me as in erroneous dates cellphones when they didnt exist etc having watched it again and even ignoring this carelessness my core opinion has not changed  this is a turkeysorry but i missed to alleged tension and excitement that others somehow managed to glean from this the bishop character changes from a no questions asked baby faced assassin in nam to becoming an idealist  hardly the trait of an espionage operative his initial training seems to consist of chatting up women on the street and blagging his way into an old codgers flat when he is in the berlin bar during the cold war he blurts out the fact that he and muir are both spies ooooooopshope the kgb werent listeningonce in the field our pretty boy  come on he is just toooo pretty to convince as a spy sees fit to drag muir across an urban battlefield in lebanon to get to a restaurant to snoop on a terrorist leader surely there was a safer route then when the suicide car bomb explodes he wanders moronically towards the burning building and the islamic militia a militia man then just shoos him away  very realistic  notapaert form the dreadful love story between pitt and the human rights activist there is a lot of on screen puppy love between pitt and redford in fact redford gives pitt a lesson in acting and pitt seems gormless in his scenes with redford  may have seemed like a good idea at the time but pitt is totally miscast here and gives one of his worst performances running the devils own closethe very essence of this travesty is a love story and the message that friendship is paramount not orders sorry didt i hear the word assets mentioned a dozen timeswatch instead the based on a true story movie farewell to observe how dirty the really is to see the fate suffered by an idealist spy and his idealist handler there are no hollywood endings,intelligence
very good actors in a very bad movie which is everything but not entertaining you think its a joke that they put such good actors in this movie the business information tells us the film has to be bad it costs 92 million dollar and grosses 62 million dollars the film lost about 50 percent gross in the second week if you relate it to the opening weekend i was very sad i saw the film in the sneak preview and almost the half of the audience seemed to sleep after 90 minutes i think hollywood made too much of this genre,intelligence
 2001directed by tony scottstarring robert redford and brad pittplot overview redford stars as cia operative nathan muir who is on the brink of retirement from the field when he learns his protg tom bishop has been arrested in china on a charge of espionage no stranger to the machinations of the cias top echelon muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to free bishopconsidering the stellar cast and crew that made this film this was a very disappointing bland forgettable experience this isnt a bad film most of the key ingredients are there to make it a good movie they were just mixed together incorrectly it is such a bland and boring movie that i just cant understand the rating is currently has the story for this movie is so disappointing i had infinitely more interest in the small stories told by redford about him and pitt the modern day story for this film was so uninteresting and boring that even the film tries to sideline it for the majority of the film even the ending was very anticlimactic and uninteresting for me and i knew exactly what i was supposedly getting into i knew this was a dramapolitical thriller i wasnt expecting the avengers to pop up or some huge action set piece i just found the movie inexplicably boring and inefficient of what it was attempting to achievei do like things about this movie however both robert redford and brad pitt were excellent in their respective roles their performances were easily the highlight of the movie as was seeing two powerhouse actors working of off each otheron the subject of positives the cinematography and editing were both decent and i do appreciate scotts visual styledespite these positives was just boring for me it wasnt interesting and was an overall chore to watch i cannot recommend this movie it really isnt that good ill rate this film a disappointing 4 flashbacks out of 10,intelligence
havent we seen redford in this sort of thing before he was much better in three days of the condor than here its hard to think that in the span of 24 hours brad pitts fate will be resolved in a farfetched way but given the fact that this cia agent played by redford can accomplish so much in a cinematic day outsmarting the same organization and colleagues he used to work with its a wonder the agency can survive at all  that there could be such dumb people employed by the government who will leave their badges and ids laying around could only happen in the minds of screenwriters michael frost beckner and david arata what was the point of the berlin rooftop scene was tony scott trying his hand at a commercial for outdoor furniture we only hope the character portrayed by redford is living well as the security manager for a hotel in the bahamas after his retirement and that tom the brad pitt character is finally allowed to settle down in sedona doing spiritual readings after all he goes through in this movie poor guy he must have gotten paid not too many millions to appear in this film,intelligence
in robert redford plays a spy with feelings hes risen high in the central intelligence agency and looking towards a nice retirement on some tropical beach but brad pitt who he brought into the agency straight from being a sniper in vietnam has gone off on an unauthorized mission thats not something the spy people usually deal in hes gotten himself caught in a chinese prison and is ready to be executed in 24 hoursthe cia has written him off but redford hasnt not by any means as he plays agency politics he also reminisces about his 16 year relationship with pitt from vietnam in 1975 until the capture which takes place in 1991its a particularly embarrassing situation for the agency because the president is just about to embark on a good will mission more so because if you remember the president in 1991 was one george hw bush who was both a former cia director and ambassador to china is a good not great film unfortunately the film does not develop any secondary characters at all which in redfords scenes at the langley virginia headquarters would have been of vital importance is strictly a star vehiclewhy is redford doing this it could be any number of reasons not the least of which is a not too subtle gay relationship hes having with pitt also whereas spies are disposable people and folks know that going into that field of employment redford is still operating as a military man from vietnam who has a great distaste for not going back for his men on a given missionwhy has pitt got himself in this jackpot in the first place for that you have to see the film,intelligence
now about the movieits pretty bad not because of the politicsmind you i like movies even if i dont agree with their political viewsredfords sneakers for egthe movie is just too boringits vast potential of excitement and intrigue have been squandered by heavy handed political correctness and an incredibly dull romance betweeen brad pitt and whatsherfacei detested the predictable political correctness and its juvenile moral posturingwe are supposed to feel sympathy for that leftist lady who was once a terrorist herself but ridiculously disapproves of american intervention in lebanonof course she is portrayed in a positive light because of her leftist viewsbrad pitts character was a complete dumbass who didnt belong in the job in the first placei wouldve liked to see them both rot in that chinese jail for the rest of their lives the cia is portrayed unfairlyforget about the chinese trade connectionthey shouldve let him rot in jail just because he doesnt know how to follow ordershe is also a goddamn idiotwho needs such a person in the ciatony scott should be ashamedshame shame on you tony scottwhy dont you just quit and let your brother ridley make films that are unapologetically heroic and nobleblack hawk down,intelligence
this movie is trite meaningless unlovingly unconvincingly put together counterfeit plain bad and from the starting material totally disappointing if you look at redford and pitt you will notice though that they both have proven on more than one occasion either that they are not interested in the material or that they simply are not really good at smelling bfilm materialthe script for this film is so utterly boring filled with stupid and risible clichs it is mindboggling the way top agents deliver headline news from 1520 years ago as if they were discussing top secret actions is almost funny otherwise it is very hard to keep your attention on this film as there are no details that are even remotely interestinghumanly the storyline is also quite poor in development and credibility this is in part the responsibility of the actors or should i say the casting director as often with pitt and maybe to a lesser degree redford there is no chemistry the story suffers as we are supposed to believe that the people in this movie are intensely involved with one anotherapart from the script and the actors i was appalled by the lack of pace in some parts and the forced pace in others especially the start of the movie tries to pull us by the shirt when we havent even begun to understand what the pooha is all about this is because all the cinematographic tricks in this phase and also later on are unimaginatively thrown in without any freshness the action becomes lame and feels forcedi switched at 34 and had fun with the last half of when harry met sally that ones worth my time at least,intelligence
first and formosa brilliant film though there are a couple of factual errors the opening sequence is set in 1991  and caption is hong kong china so six years too early before handoverda nang marine corps air base and facility had fallen  already gone by 1975 tbh be better if they set the assassination least in 68in the dvd extras the director when talking about the aerial sequences  directed and flown by marc wolff about the vc never having helicopters however the north vietnamese air force did operate helicopters such as the mil4  not mil2 hoplite in the movie would have thought as its 91 there be a strong of references for the middle east re desert storm etc,intelligence
as with all tony scott films you are guaranteed a pace and drive seldom seen with any other director take this unique brand of scott couple it with a sense of realistic espionage and you have yourself a good film add to this combination the acting of redford and pitt and you have got yourself a great film robert redford the old hand experienced spy paired up with his young prodigy brad pitt will the young spy follow the rules will the old hand learn to change the pair have a very strong on screen chemistry which bleeds through into the audience the film is unpredictable edge of your seat watching masterclass in all areas,intelligence
the movie is excellent and i mean ezcellent brad pitt as the rescuee and robert redford as the rescuer tony scott brings a fantastic and surprising new thriller that makes the game so simple bring pitt homethe movie layers out fantastic flashbacks where pitt gives it all as tom bishop the cia man that goes rogue and goes missing whilst redford as the upcoming retired cia operative nathan muir as his partner both going through mission after mission the film wraps up fantastically with its flashback scenes and gives the movie a cuttingedge of what happened before the movies opening scenetony scott brings exhilarating excitement and the movie is absolutely sensational its worth every minute pitt steals the movie but redford is not far behinda mustsee overall a fantastic movie worth seeing,intelligence
this is the kind of movie if liked than can be watched hundred of times without any hesitation a tony scott picture is always worth watching i really loved this film even though its entirely fiction but it is worth catching upon for many many timesthe leads brad pittrobert redford and others really made sure to make the audience stick to the movie with their extraordinary acting if someone didnt like the movie then heshe should never watch this type of genres everthe leads did their work so well that maybe someone somewhere must be playing the character of nathan muir or tom bishop,intelligence
heres an atypical but enthralling thriller from surehand director tony scott which plays out most of its tale in various flashbacks but is held together through an excellent leading turn from robert redford redford is an ageing cia agent and on his last day of work before retirement gee where have we heard that one before he learns that his young protg has been captured for spying in a chinese prison and is due to be executed the following morning much of the film consists of him relating previous experiences and adventures to his superiors as the clock ticks down towards his partners imminent death whilst this might not sound to be very interesting viewing the flashbacks are invariably exciting and involve lots of secrecy death and open warfare in some cases an excellent interlude in beirut for example elements all woven together wellthe present scenes of redford using his own contacts and methods to help his captured chum are excellently portrayed and even if the film comes a little loose towards the ending it still engages the senses through the quality of the acting heres a film with some fleshedout characters brought to vivid life through the strong actors playing them redford and pitt are excellent in their two very different roles and we also get strong support from catherine mccormack as pitts love interest and stephen dillane excellently snide as an enemy of redfords at the intelligence agency flashily directed by scott and never lulling for a moment this is an exciting and intelligent movie with plenty of incident and dynamism to recommend it,intelligence
this movie needs a part 2 its great story line and delivery are awesome to watch keeps you in your toes most of the time exciting and action suspensethis movie would compete with jason bourn james bond and other action moviesthe part that brad pitt heard the code line when he got rescued he thought that robert have abandoned him for goodthere is always a backroom transaction and will never know who ordered it how it was executed and deliveredthis would be a blockbuster movie it ever part 2 would be created,intelligence
at its heart this is a simple story about friendship and love  the movie never really bothers to explore the world of secret agents  it never wants to become something really serious  if this was made in the 70s we probably would have a deep and meaningful movie here tony scott is interested only in making entertainment  the scene when redford and pitt talk at the top of the building is a symbol of that scott is more interested in playing with camera instead of that important conservationits not a bad movie  its long  but moves along quite nicely  its definitely entertaining and sometimes really nice looking the acting is good  there are some small twists along the way some clever dialogueits just sad that instead of ambitious movie we have a nice entertainment  worth rental  but completely empty inside and leaves your head the very next day i give it 510,intelligence
capably led by redford as the wily cia supervisor on the verge of retirement whose sendoff is overshadowed by the capture and imminent execution of one of his former agents in china the film focuses on redfords lone efforts to arrange pitts rescue recounting in flashback his relationship with the former sniper from his initial recruitment and training to daring operations behind enemy lines around the world spanning almost twenty yearsits comicbook stuff and looks purposebuilt for both redford and pitt redford indisputably the headline act with minor roles for david hemmings as an ambassador to hong kong shane rimmer and charlotte rampling as a former spy and love interest to redfordlong and meandering theres not much sense about the proceedings and yet its fairly engaging material nonetheless with some effective action sequences occasional humour usually at the expense of pompous cia boss dillane and even a moment or two of pathos as pitt reveals a softer core that predictably jeopardises his position as both the master spy and fractures his friendship with the more pragmatic redford not great but not bad,intelligence
well this is clever but not so much in the conventional way its a spy film and  just forget bond ever was  a spy film in good hand is one of the best forms of cinematic meditation we have the main exercise expounded in the film as well is that you will have to train yourself to absorb everything while being invisible in plain sight to touch every corner of every room but leave everything where you found it see but have no thought what its about trusting the thing to reveal itselfso from your end you will have to spy reflections of a game between storytellersthe premise is that cia ops get together in a room in langley to decide what kind of story to circulate about one of their men being held prisoner by the chinese standard covert ops rules apply so 24hrs before he gives up the game press and congressional hearings have to be kept out of the way our guy has a hunch that something is not quite right and sure enough lucrative business deals are on the table the national image a presidential visit scheduled for next week hes asked background of the guy that years ago he ran as his agent hidden cameras are filming our film about the story being put together by now this is so typical it has no spark no introspective spying is required behind the camera here you will have to see past the story he tells in conventional terms its an exciting story exciting in that episodic ordinary way so danang in 75 the training phase running agents to and from the berlin wall a mole in the embassy wartorn beirut in the 80s the listeners invest thinking its going to reveal something but from your end you will know the story is the agent so assess and discard superfluous detail while keeping an eye on movements in the roomnow i like to think that the only bit of the story that is credible is vietnam which is the point where the other execs interrupt with the convenient conclusion that the guy was an assassin hence a liability an assassin in war of all thingsit turns out that the whole purpose of the meeting is the gathering of material for a coverup story and hes being run as an agent to that effect testimony by so and sohis own story that he tinkers and tailors is the decoy that buys time to counterplot a rescue missionon the level of the film its all a decoy to keep us from really paying attention to how ridiculous is putting the mission into effect its pure hollywood fiction disguised as procedural disguised by more hollywood fiction disguised as history its all tailored on this end to be a project that robert redford says yes to so it has the noble struggle the tacky lessonsinside the fiction its all about love and commitment that tony scott dedicates as a story to his recently departed mother this is the one noble thing to me last caring glimpses on separate planes up in the air,intelligence
has become one of my favorite films of all time for its unique locations and events i might not really know much about acting but redford and pitt both give very good performances and the plot while having very little action is still enough to keep me re watching this film time and time again what i really enjoy about this film is its authenticity for portraying cia operations during the cold war the agents are given cover jobs cover names etc and they have to do them convincingly as not to alert anyone of their true intentionsthe only dislikes i have is the point of conflict between muir and bishop elizabeth hadley its where the film suffers mainly love stories dont belong in films like this and the unbelievably stupid reason of how bishop got caught in china since when does bubblegum translate to theres a spy here its the dumbest moment of the whole film makes no sense whatsoever and i truly hate it those 2 things shouldve really been changedaside from those 2 annoyances is a very enjoyable film that gives you a look at how the cia works and the issues field agents have to face one of the most dramatic scenes is when muir decides to call the local militia to assassinate someone because he wasnt fully sure that bishop could get there in time its not that he doesnt trust his partner its just that he cant take that marginal risk that their target has a chance to get away no matter how slim that chance is its an excellent thriller with a lot of atmosphere and a great story sure it has some errors but name one movie that doesnt it might take more than one time but itll grow on you until you have no choice but to add it as a favorite,intelligence
i just watched this movie again on netflix and was reminded how much i liked it robert redford turns in one of his better later performances and is a believable character as the cia field agent nathan muir on his last day brad pitt too gives one of his better turns as tom bishop an operative recruited by muir with growing disillusionmentthe two of them are reason enough to watch this in typical scott fashion the story moves fairly quickly and the camera angles border on producing motion sickness as they swirl around the characters much like scenes from man on fire if you watch this without thinking too much about it but rather allow yourself to get caught up in the finer points of the story you will find the movie to be an enjoyable diversionhowever the film cannot rise above 7 out of 10 because the story itself does not bear up under anything resembling close inspection the goofs that are chronicled on this site give a pretty good accounting of the things that undermine the storys believability you dont have to follow world events very closely to know that the us never had an embassy in hong kong or in west berlin not technically ever a part of west germany for that matter for those who speak german using hungarians to pose as vopos volkspolizei  east german police is a disappointment from the goofs apparently those facile in chinese will also be disappointedyou can dwell on such things and allow them to spoil the movie for you however if you chose to overlook the absurdities this is an enjoyable tale with compelling characters,intelligence

is an entertaining enough espionage thriller helmed by action film director tony scott who has made some very polished films in the past here an aging robert redford is appropriately cast as the mentor to brad pitt or burapi as the japanese call him redfords star field agent when i was watching this film i got the impression that the cia undoubtedly the preeminent espionage organization on the planet was being glorified for its interference in foreign conflicts i couldnt help but remember benjamin franklin advising his fellow republicans to stay out of conflicts that do not threaten americas vital interests paraphrasing he said interference in affairs that do not concern us would be the bane of our republic,intelligence
great story but unlikely the given timeframesometimes one just have to wonder why filmmakers are trying to make a script tighter i mean they ought to do it in more movies  by all means but that doesnt mean that they should screw up the timeframe of which the movie and the plot spansto be tighter in this film only made it poorer even with no breaks for rest or eat  the time frame of is far fetchedit simply is impossible to reach over all the events that are suggested in such short time span as we are tried to be made believe by the storytellers,intelligence
sometimes you get the feeling just by watching the cover of the dvd that the movie isnt going to be any good thats exactly what happened here i never felt like buying or even renting it because it looked like a typical brainless james bond movie with a lot of explosions and stupid gadgets sorry for the people who love james bond movies its just not my style but i have to admit that this time my feeling was completely wrongit was shown on television on a saturday night i didnt think i would like it but i taped it anyway because the reviews in the magazines were quite good today i didnt have much better to do so i watched it and i was pleasantly surprised by it the story isnt unique a cia agent one day away from his retirement tries to save a young colleague out of the hands of the chinese he was captured when trying to liberate the woman he loves from a military prison hes being tortured by the chinese and hell be executed the next 24 hours nothing new i hear you say a typical hollywood script you think true but robert redfort and brad pitt really acted very well and the director tony scott did an excellent job by using flash backs all the time at first these flash backs made the movie a bit confusing but as the story progresses it really gives you a better idea on who these people are what they have in common why they are in that particular situation all in all this is an intelligent spy movie who will not be liked by everyone especially not by people who want to see plenty of action shots with a lot of guns and explosions but which certainly appealed to me i give it a 7510,intelligence
okay maybe im naive or stupid or gullible or all three but i never figure it out until the end when the movie tells me whats been going on consequently i tend to enjoy movies like this movies that give my brain enough to think about without trying to figure out what the characters are going to dovisually its very stimulating definitely one of tony scotts better achievements different regions of the world look different which is great the script is good even in the hands of two generations of hollywood pretty boys redford  pittactually theyre both pretty good when theyre at their best like in this movie the whole movie has that turnofthemillennium style which is getting old by now but felt fresh and interesting when this movie came outall in all the movie is nothing mind blowing but its an example of the hollywood system gone right its got a great story which hollywood does well when it tries with charismatic movie stars playing roles that need charisma and its a great american mythmessrs redford and pitt are mavericks in this movie mavericks who ultimately betray their country in the name of friendship great stuff i highly recommend this movie,intelligence
is an interesting movie the first half of the movie is incredible this is for two reasons the main one being robert redford in a performance that garners 10 out of 10 he is just incredible in this role and almost singlehandedly makes this movie better then averagethe second reason is the electric soundtrack heard constantly that is quite apropriate for this movie and never fails to keep the movie tense exciting and involving the problems start however in the second half of the filmthere the music is noticeably less the explosions grow quite frequent and a minor love story is thrown into the equation things also start to get confusing this is a very tough movie to follow many times i had no idea what the heck was going onand still dont in spite of those flaws however there is something strangely likable and compelling about the electric atmosphere and redfords intensity make you want to see it through and know what happens nextpitts good here though better in other roles quite honestly redford clealy steals the show herethis is a movie that as mentioned by many could have been done a lot better id still call it a good movie though in spite of its flaws it grips you from the start and is pretty well paced even though the first half is clearly better then the secondif nothing else see it for redfords incredible performance hes as good here as anything ive ever seen him in and his character will suck you in from the beginningwhen i think a movies really good i give it an 8 or abovewhen i think its alright but not great it gets a 7 is not an 8 but somehow is above a 7 as well i guess id rate this around a 77 or so if you can get through the feeling of whats going on that comes up quite frequently you can become really involved in the atmosphere and action packed story line,intelligence
i think this film is about the closest a feature film has come to accurately portraying intelligence work  yes the military side of thing was handled unrealistically but it showed what being a cia agent is about developing assets working them for information and then leaving them out to dry,intelligence
spoilersit appears from the distribution of votes this movie has received more success than it earned my wife and i watched it and enjoyed every suspenseful minute of it i suspect there really are covert operations similar to those depicted here but the story in does not have great substance it is a fairly simple story of pitts character being imprisoned in china and about to retire redfords character doing whatever he can think of pull whatever covert strings he can all the while fooling his own intelligence personnel to try and get his pupil free before he gets executed pitt is good but the real reason to enjoy this movie is redford and he shows why he has had such a long and successful career acting we never find out much about the characters or their motivation and when it ends and redford is driving away while his bosses puzzle over what just happened we feel a bit like we did at the end of the usual suspectsthe critic ebert has an unusually clear and accurate review of the details of the story,intelligence
despite some rather unbelievable parts this is a spy yarn that holds together pretty well theres nothing you havent seen before in other films of this genre but theres enough subterfuge and daringdo to hold up the interest level robert redford and brad pitt play cia operatives redford the jaded older mentor and pitt the younger more impulsive wild card the film fractures a bit as it tracks their somewhat tempestuous relationship through vietnam berlin and beirut supposedly 20 years in a high stress job and they didnt seem to age but then pulls back together at the end the film has some interesting looks into the moral gray area that is espionage rating 7 out of 10,intelligence
is an entertaining movie  one of the movies which engages your mind through the whole movie although 126 minutes is considered rather lengthy these days its not boring at all thats what is naturally expected from the director tony scott  but what is irritating in  is that when you review the movie in your mind later  after all the exciting story is finished  you realize that after all its an american hero who solve all the problems although the american patriotism is not as severe as scotts older movies like top gun but it still exists  one may wonder why should such classy actors   robert redford brad pitt   should accept such scripts  the movie openly shows scenes of violence in china and middle east  how long will they continue using such villains  they remind you of rambo  even in serious movies like this one  the worst thing the movie shows about cia is that they have some clandestine meetings and they sometimes prefer trade over peoples life  but who doesnt know that  what many americans still dont know is that people of third world countries are not wild animals  when some respectable artists play in a film like this then it is no wonder why a cowboy like george bush want to conquer all the world the soundtrack including brothers in arms by dire straits and rocky mountain way by joe walsh supports the energetic movie scorephotography and editing give some extra speed to the movielets hope that someday even the action movies become indifferent whether people are american british arab or chinese  a real should be spying for spyings sake not for racial sake  this movie tries to do that but it is still not enoughi rate this movie 6 of 10 for being technically wellmade,intelligence
this film shows one of the last of the humint handlers human intelligence that which comes from people in cia retiring and trying to pull a joe out of jam as his last act  the political infighting and sniping that is almost everything that happens at langley accurately shows how badly cia has deteriorated from the peak of its powers in the 1960s by the time this film takes place ca 1991 cia is mostly concerned with not getting caught in the same room as an opinion which is easy with satellite pictures and signal intercepts since they can be interpreted in so many ways and messy humint people like muir and bishop that can verify their other sources are viewed as dangerous dinosaurs  small wonder then that on 911 cia was busy making diversity quilts having been forbidden to use foreign agents by willie jeff two years before and factfound into impotence by nearly twenty years of congressional interference into matters they knew nothing aboutthe time line in the film is all screwed up the last us combat troops pulled out of vietnam by 1973 but weve seen a lot worse like the english patient  redford is better than average here he actually tried to fill a role not make a statement  pitt is showing some more versatility  like most redford movies its just a little too long but not as bad as horse whisperer or a few others,intelligence
despite pairing together two hollywood heavyweights in robert redford and brad pitt never manages to escape from mediocrityredford and pitt play cia agents with redford the experienced professional and pitt his young understudy recruited during the vietnam war the duo fall out and separate during one of their assignments until pitt many years later blows one of his missions and ends up being thrown into a chinese prison with pitt set to be executed for espionage in 24 hours its up to redford on hs last day before retirement how many times hasnt that been used before ie lethal weapon 3 to save his former companion from the chinese and the rest of the cia who dont want to get involvedits fascinating to see the long winded plan redford concocts from his office to save pitt without his overzealous superiors finding out without a doubt the unfolding of this plot is the highlight of unfortunately in order to make this work much time is needed to be spent on flashbacks showing the forging of pitt and redfords relationships and their relationship with a mysterious woman catherine mccormack who comes between them after a while this becomes downright tedious and is drawn out much longer than necessaryalso a little difficult to ascertain is the motives of robert redfords character at one point he shows little remorse in accidentally killing 70 civilians in order to complete a mission but then gives up his entire retirement savings and risks possible litigation to save one person redford is nevertheless not too bad and neither is pitt despite little screen time but a bit tighter scripting may have helped both of them elevate this filmas a side note although is advertised as an action movie there is precious little action to be seen director tony scott seems to be trying more to make a thinking mans flick which is probably not his forte and doesnt particularly suit his stylised direction with fast forward sequences and drained out colours very similar to the way his brother ridley shot black hawk down overall dont expect to see anything overly remarkable with its good enough to pass the time as a saturday afternoon rental but it certainly wont be a film youll be discussing for days afterward610,intelligence
a neat little plotredford brads old colleague who he fell out with is grilled about brads past  cue flashbacks  in attempt to disgrace and discredit him so the chinese can execute him on spying charges  redford uses rest breaks and guile to find out whats happened and arrange a rescueits a solid film mostly in flashback about brads recruitment and their subsequent spying exploits in the cold war and beirut  if i had to criticise and i do it would be that brad pitt was supposedly recruited as a sniper in the vietnam war  hes 38 years old looks nearer 30 even in real life and were expected to believe hes a minimum of 55 years old  i may have some dates wrong i was only halfwatching the film but that killed the drama stone dead for mei would also say that although i enjoyed redfords raceagainsttime the memories  which make up about 23 of the film left me curiously bored theyre well shot and everything no faulting the visuals but i was bored and ill sit through almost anything  catherine mccormack did an adequate job in a token rolewith redford  pitt in the same movie it just should have been better,intelligence
tony scott possesses the art of gripping you throughout his films but afterwards you realize they are an unbelievable mixture of improbabilities  impossibilities and nonexplanations such was the case with the nevertheless highlyentertaining enemy of the state such is the case here too the story is set forth in the 1990s on robert redford  s retirement day from the cia with a lot of flashbacks over a period of some 15 years redford was 63 at the time of the shooting and is suitably wrinkled for the later period but the makeup department apparently found it impossible to make him look younger therefore he does not age one day during all the flashbacks when he consistently looks too old he has retained his magnetism though while pitt is better than his usual soso level catherine mccormack is good but surprisingly drawn in an underdeveloped part and marianne jeanbaptiste shines as redfords secretary my acting kudos however go to the two langley interrogators accomplished stephen dillane and tooseldomseenonthebigscreen impressive larry bryggman,intelligence
overall a pretty good flick but this movie just makes me want to scream when i see redfords boss in the movie trying to sound american and not quite making itwhy do english directors insist on casting english actors into american roles  not enough american actors  i must admit i often find myself embarassed by american actors trying to fake english accents as well  we all know that the actors want to try this out but why do directors let them  especially since the directors often dont know any better and would not detect poor accents  someone should sit these guys down and stop being yes menstop the cross cultural madness black hawk down had the same kind of annoying situations english actors as southern usa captains and sargentsaaaaarrrrggghhhhh  lol,intelligence
when i saw who the director was of tony scott director of top gun and days of thunder i was a bit hesitant about watching this movie however once the movie was over i was quite impressed first of all i loved the way he structured the movie on an investigation around brad pitts character and robert redfords character going around cia politics to save his former partner throughout the movie brad pitt and robert redford each have their own defining moments and nobody seems to steal the show i loved the way robert redfords character seems so mysterious to everyone including the cia some people say that this is poor character development however i believe it is another way to show a character trait of a cia agent tony scott did wonderful job with the camera shots especially when robert redford and brad pitt are talking on the roof the aerial shot was just so incredible particularly when he mixed the aerial camera and the camera on the roof itself which gave the movie a certain style that i have never seen before that one scene struck me because you could see the beautiful architecture of germany without distancing yourself from the story by far this is tony scotts best movie,intelligence
i enjoy seeing this movie but i gave it only a five  this movie is misleading the audience  they were too lazy or things that the spectator is not clever enough to understandfirst china is gmt8 and washington dc is gmt5  id like to know how you can explain the timingsecond a rescue operation over china with nearly no preparation is something for sylvester stallonesome makeup for the actors would not have been bad to hide the years  it makes the movie looks likei think i enjoy it because the meeting scenes at langley are very good and that it shows the way the cia deals with the worldto reply to some critics the film would not have been less entertaining with more riguour in the scenario,intelligence
is one of my favourite movies of the last year it was the only film i really enjoyed watching when i went to the movies unlike other movies recently released really topped them you see the main characters redford and pitt develope thru the movie redford tells the story to a bunch off other guysyou see the story in a lot of flashbacks the acting in the film is superior and the story line is allright finally a film worth watching these days,intelligence
this is one great espionage movie very realistic fantastic screenplay great plot superb filming it has it all and one of the best things its not another american propaganda movie it shows the bad things of the cia etc etcin one word great movie,intelligence
now first of all i love redford  as an actor not otherwise as i aint no homo but i digress i especially like him in his roles of intrigue and mystery or suspense this movie seemed tailormade for me as a 7 i dont hate it but there is always room for criticism on a 7 of 10i basically enjoyed the 2 hours i only criticized it in the first 20 minutes as a few ridiculous assumptions were made and they werent even necessary also the other major criticism was the editing horrible obviously this movie was much longer late in the process and someone went at it with a meat cleaver at the last minutelastly i just didnt think it had the suspense i expected it would have although the idea of a within the inner sanctum of the cia was unique and intriguing i just thought it fell flat compared to s in the field and redford was too subdued in the rolebut i sat through it and i gave it a 7 however if it wasnt redford and it wasnt a spy thriller  a genre i like a lot i would be blasting this movie much worse,intelligence
well i wasnt expecting much of this movie that much more i liked it in the end this movie is one of the best in its category it goes on and has its quality from start to finish no silly or pathetic ending like similar movies tend to end if you tired of all the movies with brainless shooting action and superman heroism this movie will be surprising refreshment for you i cant just say anything else than recommend this movie,intelligence
is like a book you cannot put down  the story and action grip you at the beginning and your mind never wanders until after the credits are finished at the end  robert redford is at his best since he appeared in the sting although the movies are definitely different  for an evening of action will not disappoint you,intelligence
poster sampeckinpaw askswas brad pitt playing a person 45 years old in the hong kong prison or was he only 10 years old in the viet nam sequenceearly in the film a news broadcast in the background covers the 2nd anniversary of the berlin wall falling  that would place the films current time around 1991  if we assume brad pitt was 19 in vietnam in 1975 then when in the chinese prison he would be 35 years old  much more believablewith regards to your other questions and the complaints of other posters obviously the film requires suspension of some belief  however in contrast to the usual mindless drivel doled out in typical hollywood actiondrama films s compares very favorably,intelligence
is not my type of film i dont generally like political movies the only reason i went to see this was for brad pitt and robert redford i wasnt disappointed i love brad pitts work i think he is one of the finest actors in the world today and if you can get past the fact that he is a very good looking person you will probably be able to appreciate this while i am not robert redfords biggest fan i like a majority of his work and i think he is one the best actors of his generation but for a film to impress me it has to have more than two good actors there has to be a decent plot in there somewhere something to keep me interested i think the reason i liked this so much is because while it does focus on politics it focuses a lot more on nathan and toms relationship which is the strong point of the film  whenever the two of them interact in the film it comes to life they have a great on screen chemistry with each other and they are helped by a good script overall good political film great performances 810,intelligence
i certainly havent seen a film like this for a long time its aninteresting one redford is on top form but brad pitt was maybe alittle bit of the opposite the directing is superb and so is thescript they got it just right the film unravels slowly all most toslowly at times and then speeds up when you dont want it to thisis the only disappointing factors you need to be very awake to thisfilm so id recommend it,intelligence
robert redford and brad pitt both deliver a great performance in this very exciting spy thriller although you seem to miss a motive for redfords actions late in the film the movie still delivers an exciting insight in what could be the inner workings of a secret service worth to watch,intelligence
ciamercenary intelligence at its best  i especially liked the acting between robert redford and brad pitt  a thinking persons covert behind the scenes ciaspy movie  this movie requires diligent concentration to follow the plot but worth your time,intelligence
spoilers this movie is not so much tense as watchable slick cool cinematography although looking a little passe these days and utilitarian backdrops make for an attractive if not warm 2 hoursmany of the other reviewers have failed to pick up the humour in this is a funny funny film  often very dry and witty  that takes a stab at the corrupt cia legend scott delivers a bunch of twitchy morons and deskjockeys who make redford look supercool pitt is only seen in flashbacks but looks suitably eraspecificthe only thing i would really criticize is the 3 or 4 times we see pitt being tortured by the chinese this is the only time the film slips into cliche how much more chilling would it have been if wed had pitt treated well just hours before his executionfor a lowbudget movie shot largely in england this is topquality fare highly recommended,intelligence
is a solid entry into the spy genre which has been lacking as of late  both redford and pitt turn in aboveaverage performances to characters that probably should have had a little harder edge to them particularly redford  the story despite flashbacks is always interesting thanks to some wellplotted writing  the only letdown is the ease that redford makes the ending happen  there werent any obstacles in his way  basically the only dilemma he had was the choice to give up the 280k hed been saving  the film is helped by sharp directing and cinematography  kudos to the editor toooverall a film that you can watch more than once  and thats saying something these days354 stars 12 out of ,intelligence
saggy redford plays a retiring cia operative analyst whatever whos last gasp is to help his former underling brad pitt to escape from being executed from a chinese prison it would have been a good movie if the movie had concentrated on the covert operations and less on redford swaggering around langley with his cel phone duping his colleagues in overly dramatic board room meetings and ruminating over the good old times in a dizzying array of flashbacks if you like staring at redford for extended periods of time while he ponders his options then go see it otherwise check out octopussy again roger moore might have been old and ridiculous as james bond but at least he knew how to kick ass,intelligence
is a genius movie the cinematography was incredible  with awesome camera angles and a nitty gritty type of feel to it not to be compared with traffic through out the whole movie there was a great use of flashbacks and plays with past and present which really added to the suspense and made it hard to keep your eyes peeled off the screen for a minute in fear that you would miss a vital part of the plot with so many bad spy flicks out there proved that there is hope for this genre  with the exception of some without the cheesy lines and overexaggeration it was very realistic and seems to mimic what the cia is really like robert redford and brad pitt are an exhilarating pair,intelligence
the thing i liked most about the film was that the actors didnt try and steal the show they just did the job they had to do brad pitt was his usual great self as was redford the cool camera movements were great as they showed the whole film like the cia themselves were being watched at least thats what i thought anyway confident directiona top plot great actors and some big explosions make this a winner well done tony scott,intelligence
interesting story with fine performances and brainsis a well directed hollywood movie from british director tony scottstory is okey enoughbut not that interestingstory changes from time to time and its told over a 20 years periodso the movie its kind of confusingand a little boring sometimesbut good cast helps and is entertaining throughoutbut it doesnt stay in your mind that longwatch it anywayrated 610,intelligence
starts ok but becomes quite dull until the finalethe movie isnt helped by it being predictable redford is good but in the flashback scenes he looks ancient it tries hard to be another clear and present danger but fails in truth the tailor of panama was a lot better than thisso just 6 out of 10 for this movie,intelligence
ok now youve seen the trailer for this film right and you probably have seen the poster well so have i and as usual whoever put these ads together did a horrible job at first the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the pairing pitt and redford and with the hopes that brad redeems himself for the last big duo pairing the devils own which sucked well im glad i saw this film im glad i ignored my disgust at those ads and took a chance to see it i really liked it the film begins with the capture of tom bishop pitt he was on a mission which remains unknown for the most part of the film and is held in a chinese prison with 24 hours left he is executed after those first 7 minutes i was sold on the rest of the film i love spy films although i have to admit ive never been a fan of the 007 films but was always keen to the theme whats cooler than being a spy batman but thats a whole other story so the opening sequence its quickly paced like most tony scott films and is very slick even in the most dirty environments this film looks great thats one thing that you just cant help in this film there is plenty of style does it work sure we then cut to an asleep robert redford he is awakened by a call filling him in on bishops capture today is nathans redford last day at the cia but this situation is going to stir things up you see nathan muir was the one that brought tom bishop into the cia he taught him everything he needed to know we learn this through a series of flashbacks as nathan is asked to discribe his relationship and events that took place while knowing tom there are some heavy political issues at hand here and so the cia is willing to have the chinese do as they wish with tom do we ever really get a feel of these politics not really but it doesnt matter what does matter is the realtionship between tom and nathan what matters is that the clock is ticking and that throughout the film you want to see what happens redford was great in this film and carried it completely ive never been a big fan of his but i loved his performance in this his relationship and chemistry with pitt was great and completely believable its a good thing too because otherwise the film just wouldnt have worked the scenes are pretty tight and have a nice weight to them the blend of past and present could not have worked better although the characters just dont show the periods well as they never seem to age but its a minor detail now there are plot holes but none that i aint willing to forgive let me tell you i loved the mission impossible movies you just have to believe it to a certain extent to really enjoy it and when performances are well executed thats exactly what they allow you to do how can you refuse the serious look on redfords face i sometimes feel a story that is unbelievable looks more believable if its told in a more realistic style im sure i would have liked that more in this case but i certainly didnt mind the style i recommend the movie but had the studio released better promotions i wouldnt have had to got it,intelligence
a very solid spy flick that has its moments the redfordpitt duo works very well as the two sex symbols of the pastpresent come together to deliver solid performances for anyone who has seen the trailer the cool part where pitts character is describing the people on the street well that part is not in the movie not in the version i saw anyway overall good film that takes you on a rollercoaster ride into the depth of the bureaucracy and the reality of the spy universe,intelligence
it felt like the director was trying to make the movie complicated with all the flashbacks and forwards just to confuse rather than a real story telling purpose  the bashing of incompetent cia got a bit boring the movie was trying to sell you on this a deep plot after a lot of deep thought i figured it out the whole movie was designed as a vehicle for redford,intelligence
the first time i saw this one mustve been 2002 it was late at night and if i remember correctly i had had a wine or two too many as well the second time i saw it was with a winy friend who didnt feel like watching a movie suckerbut even without those handicaps is tough to figure out it doesnt help that within the first scene we see brad pitt somewhere in some hospital but why when howover the course of the movie we find out the relationship between him and robert redford whos in langley i think the entire time how they met in the far east and what happened nextits a classy thriller leave that up to scott but unclear in its meanings and not really satisfying in the end on the whole 610,intelligence
harry gregsonwilliams and tony scott did it again wow i was totally blow away with the music it was a total amazing music arrangement gotta love it brad pitt and rebert really did a great job together as a duo the set was realistic and amazing but wait can you fly a uh1 heli to suzou china even from a air carrier i dont think so there are some plots that are not that logical and so on but then again well its just a movie and for a movie and for entertainment cool this movie really really did a great job to put all the pieces together 9 out of 10when you watch the movie pay special attention to the music no wonder the japanese game company namco wanted harry to do their heavyweight game title metal gear solid harry is one of the best film composer in hollywood right now great job harry,intelligence
robert redford performance is adequate but his age shows hes not a sex symbol as he once was when he was younger  its almost starts to be painful to watch redford doing this movie as opposed to when he was in three days of the condor  brad pitt does a decent performance in his character role,intelligence
okay robert redford rarely screws up a role so its no surprise that his performance is solid  brad pitt may be the next redfordhe is a better actor than he has to be given his good looks and current buzz but this movie is really not very good no particular part is just awful or hard to watch but as a whole its hard to sit through  the premise is weak all the actors save redford and pitt are twodimensional i expect to see the best part of an actionadventure pic in the trailer but not in a purported suspense movie save your money wait for hbo,intelligence
we can play a game the pros and cons of this game  now we have robert redford despite his age and it shows in every close up is still cool enough to have brad pitt as a follower then we come to brad pitt super spy  doing unbelievable things for america  it makes me wonder about what these people actually need to do everyday  there is amazing shots and an entire scene on the roof of a building that seems so surreal its cool which is the fault of intense director tony scott  we add a contagious soundtrack ultra spy environments events that would fit into history and spies that have no respect for to humanity we would have what seems to be a reality based movie  now the cons  okay this movie is predictable  its a spy movie  i dont want an ending i know from the start i want an ending that satisfied all the answers that were swimming in my head yet somehow evaded explanation this did not happen in this movie  everything was obvious  although redfords performance did fool many  and my other problem they  didnt use brad pitt enough  he is immensely talented and they used him to demonstrate how much pain one person can take for the right reasons  the plot alone justifies that pitt was not allowed to demonstrate his character  he can be so cool and so unbelievable in roles  this didnt happen herebut all in all i gave it a 10 what is the point of something actually being truly perfect  the film was great and very impressive and entertaining great waste of time,intelligence
what wicked webs we weave when we practice to deceive  a quotation by something shakespeare wrote that seems to make a good intro to a movie about espionageis well just look at the title  its not a merchantivory costume drama  its a movie about spies  actually its a movie about when spies had to stop acting like spies in the early 1990sthe year is 1991  the berlin wall is down  the first george bush is president  and something not exactly nice is going on with the spooks at the cia  nathan muir redford is an agent and is retiring  today hes awakened by a phone call from the american embassy in hong kong  one of muirs proteges has gotten into a bit of a mess in china  seems that tom bishop pitt was trying to pull a rescue operation in a chinese prison and things went poorly  this couldnt have come at a worse time as the president is just about to head to china to secure a trade agreement  the head spooks led by charles harker dillane want to know what muir knows about bishop  muir wants to know what exactly is going on and why the cia hasnt just pulled an extraction  321 make plot twist go nowspy movies are convoluted and they should be  isnt in the james bond mode of spy films  its more of a tom clancy type story  more believable but with fewer dangerously hot bad girls and explosionsis drenched in cinematic style  youre always aware that you are watching a movie  but thats one of tony scotts brother of ridley scott strong points  he also made top gun and crimson tide  he makes slick commercial films  sort of like a better version of michael bay surprisingly the quickcut style wacky filters and shifts of framerate work well in this flick  it looks good it sounds good and feels good for  of the moviewhy only   its not because of tony scott or any of the actors redford plays a company man who knows when and how to cross the line and does it well  brad pitt is robert redford if redford had chosen to be a character actor instead of a leading man  stephen dillane is good at being slimy so it comes down to the story then doesnt itand the story is good up until the end  most of the movie is done in flashback with muir explaining his history with bishop  from vietnam to berlin to lebanon  any one of these stories on its own would have made a pretty good movie on its own  actually almost feels like a series of short films  the bits that happen in the films present are good too up until the end  with the sort of buildup presented you expect a bigger ending than what you get  the ending is mostly plausible but it needed something more  explosions or a shootout or a fight or something  it just didnt feel right  it plays something like the espionage version of the usual suspects only without keyser soze  apart from that quibble its certainly watchable and probably should be seen more than once just to get all the details  i think i may have missed some due to some technical problems that were fixed quite easily but they happened during the second reel when most of the exposition was going on  so my suspensionofdisbelief was suspended and the rest of my understanding suffered because of it,intelligence
i thought this was a really good movie but it was really long  i was sitting on the edge of my seat only because i couldnt wait to get up brad pitts 80s hairdo was interesting as was seeing the inside stuff in the cia headquarters  if youre looking for action or romance dont bother with this one,intelligence
what can i saythis movie is all over the place and never really settles down enough to become great but it had some pretty expensive tape to sort of magically stick everything together in a comprehendible story if you just sit and veggy out for awhile you will ooh and ahh at the perty colorsnice cinematography not much for composition but the vietnam scenes looked very dark and golden and otherwordly there was really no point to this movie but it wasnt torture either although the film whisks you away to a hundred lovely locations during redfords elegaic flashbacks without connecting any great mystery together you dont really care much about the plotlessness of it all because you just sort of get swept away in it anyway these guys sure did a good job of making nothing very interesting whether it was with some cool eeeethnic music really fasthipovercranked editing and shots or some useless slow motionits a good movie to get away from the real world for awhile the biggest risk the film takes is when redford briefly ponders the point of free trade is all the death and politics worth it for a toaster and other crappy appliances gladys was cool she plays the token black personsidekicksecretary and shes a woman alright we killed 2 birds with one stone we can now check off females and minorities in our equal opportunity checklist mr studio execand boy look at that cia if it was that easy to forge government documents im surprised people havent been using that trick already to get free cable put in their homes gee no that must be redfords superhuman intelligence pulling another fast one on our hilarious and gullible us government hee hee ho howell in conclusion this movie had a nice look to it good use of film speeds and filters and they sure love setting that clip speed to 200 on the editing machine redfords skin might qualify this as a horror movie then again another horror would be travelling all the way to utah to attend sundance and immediately be forced to watch the legend of bagger vance id choose the skin any day sorry mr redfordbeware this movie draaaaagsyoull like this flick if you really enjoy anything hollywood will continually throw money at until it looks hip and fresh and appears to have a story that was ripped off  but changed enough to feign originality you will also like this movie if like me you were bored and someone was taking you to the movies for free and everything else was sold out so it was something to watch and it actually looked nice and flowed well so it was tolerable but not very memorablethen again it seems from the other reviews here that the majority of you will probably make up more of the former than the latter so sure go ahead and watch it youll probably wanna give it a frikken oscar,intelligence
in the world of screenplays flashbacks are usually a good indication of a flawed script s gives you three long uninteresting flashbacks before the real story begins two of the flashbacks dont even tie into the finale the story lacks intrigue wit and original characters rent three days of the condor the hunt for red october the ipcress file and the day of the jackal instead,intelligence
tony scotts latest suspense film is a on and off crackerjack suspense thriller with covert ops down to the clock thrills and other good things sometimes its slow but its never intolerable with redford and pitt delivering fine performances i didnt know redford could still act this good as two spies one retiring which is redford and the other pitt is in a chinese prison in detainment for espionage and while trying to save him in a 24 hour period redford goes through their history together for a group of suspicious cia types some fine and definitely appropriate cinematography by daniel mindel and a good all around feel the atmosphere is perfect as i mentioned earlier as that the film creates situations and scenes where your eyes dont want to wander the screen for a second in fear of missing something that could be important delivered by scott and company not anything that will win awards but it is worthwhile for adults and other mature folks who might actualy go against the tide of harry potter and see this while the kids see that  b,intelligence
possible spoilers is a solid action movie and it keeps you on your toes and the overall plot is solid for an action movie  however it seems that there are a multitude of subplots throughout the movie that are intruiging yet arent allowed to develop because of the overall plot  a great movie plot would be do dwell only on the cia recruiting setting up and training of an agent as they touched upon with tom bishopoverall 7 out of 10,intelligence
great action right from the start  this movie was well written and well acted  the chemistry between the main characters worked the story kept my interest and the action just added to the whole experience  redford was his usual slick self and pitt was great as the enthusiastic pupil  this is definitely worth watching,intelligence
i loved this film its so full of suspense i was amazed to look at the time and see that it was only an hour in the acting is superb and the chemistry between brad pitt and robert redford is very effective at times they seem like father and son the plot is very sophisticated and full of twists  pretty much all of which work if you liked films like salvador heat or patriot games you will appreciate this masterful film for what it attempted to do and what it has accomplished 1010,intelligence
is one of those movies that is hard to hype  to catch the attention of potential theater patrons you have to stitch the action scenes together and toss in a few close ups of the stars  critics assaulted it as a thinking film  neither really pitches the movie for what it is a dead solid piece of cinema that is going to astound no one break no new ground and barely challenge its actors pitt basically does nothing cinematically but swallow strange capsules and provide the ricochet for the redford characters moves and redford playswell redford which is not a put down  yet the actors have to imbue their characters with realism with only quick cuts facial expressions and odd scenes  in one pitt has to do something very mundane and ordinary in five minutes  sure enough he does but we dont get to see how he does it  theres a lot of that audience participation is a must  there are certainly tense scenes try keeping your cool with a sniper rifle while an armed helicopter is blasting at you but there are after the fact scenes that almost give you no time to add two and two  this is a laid back and low key film  low low key  and while the characters are doing their low key thing these huge political and physical explosions are going off in your side vision  it wants to come off as a this is the way it really happens but we know it really isnt and that is almost an intrusion  who gets the bejeesus beat out of them better than brad  who is the epitome of quiet wisdom and common smarts than robert  especially with all his yoda wrinkles and that squinty glint with the is that a smile thing he can do  the suspense is soft and when we get socked it isnt with exploding visuals or thunderous music but with two words dinner out and a number 282000  they mean nothing unless youve kept up  i think tony scott got it all out of this film  minimal input maximum effect  he integrated his stars reputations and visual presence seamlessly into the plot  in a lot of ways this is one of those perfect films an accident of director writers actors audience and time  that doesnt make it a great film but when you can do a through the windshield of a porche shot of robert redfords face up close and personal as he drives away into the sunset with all his secrets yet unknown but unfolding in his wake and his sunglasses metaphor for things clandestineso many of the things in this movie hook together and work its just cool if you want a pure action film go elsewhere if you want a pure thinking film go elsewhere if you want something new and different go elsewhere if you want something done exceptionally well done and the serendipity of the right actors in exactly the right spot and the whole movie catch just the correct pitch and tone  then youve come to the right place always count your wives a quiet dead solid perfect movie,intelligence
creativelyedited wellacted and just flatout good redford does a great job with an interesting character and even pitt isnt bad lots of interesting footage in beirut vietnam and berlin for once flashbacks work anyone looking for mindless highaction car chases and all the usual spy cliches will no doubt be disappointed but its worth seeing more than once,intelligence
had all the potential to be a really good movie for me and for the most part it was the acting was fine the story was intriguing the pace was a little slow at times but thats ok with me the over all production was fine the thing that made this movie disappointing for me was that i was asked to believe that brad pitts character served in viet nam and never aged the story is about a spy who gets caught in a foreign country and the us government is reluctant to rectify the situation in any acceptable manner robert redford plays a cia agent on his last day before retirement he gets the news that his friendspy is in trouble and starts to gather information on what if anything is being done to attempt a rescue when he finds out that the government is stalling redford starts to pull some strings of his own to get the rescue ball rolling thats all fine and good except that the two characters redfords and pitts were supposed to have met in 1975 during the close of the war in viet nam and that would be ok if brad pitt looked anything like what robert redford does now i mean really if you want to tell a story and make it somewhat believable at the very least throw a little makeup on an actor so that it looks like you tried to make it look like nearly thirty years have gone by if you dont mind that kind of thing missing in a movie you might really like this the telling of the story is really quite good i really wanted to like and it really could have been a fine movie experience for me but that age discrepancy kept me from really sitting back and enjoying myself oh wellanother time another movie perhaps thats my take whats yours,intelligence
i had to overlook several plot elements that just seemed impossible but thats what you have to do every now and then to allow yourself to enjoy what turned out to be a very entertaining movie  robert redfords nathan muir was a good mix of understanding the complex game he played for life and also had enough humanity to not make him simply an evil spy  brad pitts tom bishop seemed a little idealistic to actually be a spy but he played the role quite well  catherine mccormacks role was mostly limited however she portrayed her slightly overzealous character without being overzealous with her acting  stephen dilland as harker was perfect at being able to keep a smarmy face on for just about the entire movie matthew marsh played the sympathetic dr byars with a respectful understated quality  lots of good spy stuff going on and enough action to keep you busy  7 of 10,intelligence
spoiler alert not really nothing to spoili had high hopes for but the opening scene was a joke i try not to pick apart a fictional dramaaction movie but man they made it really hard at times during the movie my wife and i would just look at each other and say wtf case in point opening scene our boy brad pops a few pills in his mouth rubs some gel on his hands palms an electrified fence blows a breaker fakes death by electrocution and then manages to spring a prisoner out of a maximum security jailall within 6 min huh i know this is fiction and the film is entitled to some creative license and perhaps departure from reality but this was a joke the other thing that was way over the line was brad pitt as a hotshot sniper in the vietnam war huh im the same age as brad pitt both born in 63 i dont know about him but in 1975 i was in jr high trying to cop a feel he apparently was overseas in the bush 40 clicks outside of saigon sniping high ranking vietnamese generals wow and then in later scenes as the years go by he looks even younger in the present scenes im supposed to believe this guy is in his late 40s it blew my mind a little makeup isnt going to hurt you pal do it for the film lol also robbie redford looks like a mummy in the vietnam shots and he somehow also seems to look younger as the years go by did these guys run into ponce de leon im tired so i wont go into the many other things that bugged me overall it was a semidecent movie that was in dire need of an editordirector that should have cut about 2025 minutes of useless footage dragged it on big time redfordpitt did a decent job the best scenes were with redford making his superiors look like bungholes which begs the questionif redfords character is such a genius spyguy why isnt he running the show over there at his cia division also he gives up his life savings to knock out the power on some chinese island for 30 min why didnt he just let commander willy or whatever his name was just use an f16 to blow out the power plant and since when does the director of the cia give orders for missions involving the armed forces i could be wrong about that but i dont think so man this movie was lame,intelligence
forget about the fact that its got robert redford i love older menor brad pitt hes not too sore on the eyes either but this movie is awesome my boyfriend and i rented it last night and he really didnt want to watch it cuz he thought i just wanted to look at the guys he ended up liking it more than me robert redford is just fantastic and the way the movie was shot and everything just really surprised us i highly recommend it 9 out of 10,intelligence
is not your typical action picture  first off and most surprisingly its not filled with ridiculous amounts of action  all the action in the film is called for due to the narrative not the other way around  in fact most of the thrills and surprises come around a table involving redford and his manipulative cia colleaguestony scott gives the film a very slick and stylized look but again nothing is overdone  redford gives one of his best performances in the film and while brad pitt isnt exceptional he is gameone of the big surprises of 2001,intelligence
tells of a retiring cia agent redford at langley who has 24 hours to try to save his novice pitt from execution in a chinese prison a half a world away a fast moving drama which tells two parallel stories the mentornovice history via flashback and the present moment insidetheagency chess match gives a smart but hollywood version of cia operations and intrigues both inside the agency and in the field a well crafted heavily edited entertaining film which keeps you thinking and guessing while delivering more dialogue than action romance sexnudity etc a must see for spy flick junkies and an okay watch for others,intelligence
after crimson tide and enemy of the state this one is another high quality thriller from director tony scott fast paced witty well written and very entertaining fine performances from brad pitt catherine mccormack stephen dillane and especially robert redford make this film a real highlight as always in a tony or ridley scott film other highlights include the inventive camerawork and editing and a fine score by harry gregsonwilliams from the zimmerfactory the whole movie reminded me of sydney pollackrobert redford spyagainsthiswillmovie three days of the condor although the situations in both movies are vastly different the proceedings the tactics and suspicions within the cia are similar and its just great fun to see redford outmaneuvering everyone else,intelligence
thank god finally a movie dealing with international terrorism and the cia that doesnt reek hollywood  this is a first class film with a very good plot and good acting  the film in a sense is almost a documentary with many real clips about past events  it adds just enough historical background for the audience to come to grips with the story  it didnt go overboard with the history though which is a good thing  there was a few hightech camera work seems that made me feel like i was watching swordfish but i didnt get worked up about it cause i new the story was going somewhere  the swordfishlike scenes were only a small part of the movie          when i heard the names redford and pitt i thought it was gonna be some corny blockbuster cia movie where they get the terrorists back but fortunately they leave that for arnold  this movie presents a real story about the situation i gave it an 810,intelligence
the first i heard of this movie was when brad pitt and robert redford had been doing a gig on i think the jay leno show where they played all these jokes to get people to see the movie it looked pretty good from the trailer as well and i must say i was pretty happy with the result im not a huge fan of robert redford but he did a good job as muir really cunning and genuine the movie also confirmed to me that brad pitt is more than just a pretty face his character tom was intelligent and fast i thought they could have expanded his role a bit more maybe give more information on his background also they dont really say why his friend tran was able to walk away from the ambulance scott free leaving behind a fellow comrade also catherine mccormacks character could have been given a bit more screen time not too mention a proper explanation of her pastthey sort of skim iteither way i give this a 710,intelligence
i saw this film about 3 weeks ago and i was pleasantly surprised it bared a number of similarities to scotts previous film enemy of the state especially in the speedframe camera work and editing the middle section of the film became a bit muddled with all the intrigue but i thought pitt and especially redford were commanding throughout the guy i went to see this with went to see behind enemy lines the next day and said that it kicked ass over this film but i just disagreed and cut a fart on him810,intelligence
spoilers aheadgood movie intelligent dialogue interesting timeline good overall butah the ending it is lacking it would take a major leap of faith to believe that after forging documents lying and generally deceiving his superiors the main character was able to leave the building unscathedother than that good film but it could have been better,intelligence
is good its not bad its not great its just good if ever there was a slightlybetterthanaverageforgettableenjoyable flick then this is it its already in the 6510 rangeacting is fine redford is his usual self and pitt admirably does the wildheaded young man again the plot is grand enough  interestingly its basically redford sitting around recounting past tales of pitts character  bishops  life these stories are intended to fill us in on how bishop came to be where he currently is  about to be executed in a chinese prison redfords character  muir  is trying to stop him and so needs to chat to get the resources and information to do so its a nice enough structure and works fine  and we do fill in gaps that make us go oh so thats what he meant earlier etc sure its not original but effective the direction is generally fine except when tony scott goes insane and starts speeding the camera around like the road runner on amphetamines its a tad over the top lad  calm downother than that the movie goes along fairly briskly and were kept reasonably entertained throughout after seeing it i could shrug my shoulders and forget it all having pleasantly enough passed away the time 6510,intelligence
i feel that there has been a dearth of good spy movies of late perhaps it is a reflection of the ending of the cold war but i felt that was as good or better than many of the genre of the recent pasti confess to my abhorrence of those silly puerile patriotic movies that seem to be little more than recruiting films for the us government and unfortunately those types seem to have predominated recentlyi thought that the acting was uniformly genuine and that tony scotts direction moved the movie into a higher plane  he had wonderfully memorable scenes of beirut during the civil war as well as browned scenes from vietnam and night scenes from east berlin  his camera movements and images were superb and i feel sure that he will continue to have an illustrious career,intelligence
brad pitt and robert redford make one heck of a great team in this movie which was terrificnathan muir is a cia agent who is on the brink of retirement just 24 hours away when he gets a call from a friend letting him know that his protege tom bishop has been captured in china for espionage when nathan arrives at work he realizes the situation is serious as he sent to questioning about tom who is to be executed in 24 hours plenty of flashbacks on how the two met how nathan got tom involved as an undercover agent and in all the time nathan is telling the story of tom to his superiors he tries to find a way in order to rescue tom during the questioning without the usage of friends assets and access keysthis was one of robert redfords best movies it reminds me of his performance in sneakers only better and this man is truly like fine wineive never been a fan of brad pitt although i believe his only movie that was decent enough to watch was legends of the fall and this one stands right beside it 1010,intelligence
this was a very good hollywood thriller to me the history behind redford and pitts character was well thought out and depicted on the big screenredford hasnt lost his onscreen charisma and was indeed convincing as muir i like the fact that the director worked the tension between him and his colleagues so well that it kept me on the edge of my seat and firmly engrossed in the film what i didnt really care for was the reasoning for pitt being put in the chinese prison sort of turning it into a love story didnt really turn my crank why oh why does hollywood always have to put some romance in a movie that doesnt really need itgood on the building tension meter the conflict in lebanon was so tangible with the all the fighting and the bombing it felt realon the whole this was a very good spy thriller with some great acting and a somewhat interesting premise behind it hats off to redford and pitt for pulling off a rather convincing portrayal of mentor and student,intelligence
its like an old movie with modern make robert redford is the best actor of his generation now that dustin hoffman and robert deniro have forgotten how to act brad pitt is a good actor too the history is concrete and fast very good a little more than entertaining,intelligence
this spy movie had the potential to be just another paycheck to the actors involved how many twists can the spy movie genre have well they found one more and both pitt and redford can be proud of their work here what started out as a film choice to avoid the lineups for lord of the rings ended up as one of the best films ive seen this year whether or not the plot is something that could actually happen is another matter but it makes more sense than memento and the characters are not caricatures but people who happen to be involved in espionage pitt fans will see more of his talent here than in oceans eleven,intelligence
robert redford is a cia agent working against the system to save brad pitt who is a loose cannon former contract agent who has gotten himself into deep trouble  great script  redford uses his brains and wiles  pitt uses his muscle and wit  brad pitt gets beaten up  flashbacks where redford is supposed to be twenty years younger are funny because no one bothered to make him look any younger  was there a continuity person on this shoot its a real good movie with action adventure history realistic settings great cinematography superb editing  an allaround high quality piece of film work calculated to entertain in such a way that you feel you are being educated at the same time  dont miss a moment or you will miss some plot bit that will leave you confused  see it,intelligence
thrilling from start to finish even the nonaction scenes had an edge to them  loved scotts fast paced camera style and great use of locations the sound track was amazing  i was transported in an instant during the flashbacks very well done  redfords best role in a long time he inhabited every scene effortlessly  pitt was wonderful i just wanted more screen time with both of them  their chemistry sparked  to me this was ultimately about friendship and love and how each characters desperate actions were guided from their heart  maybe this is just a female take on an otherwise very male moviebut an excellent movie at that,intelligence
this is one entertaining great film very intriguing premise that doesnt get boring at all the flashbacks are the best parts of the movie and the scenes involving talking of officials are interesting to wtach and are somewhat humorous with how redford is just ping them off brad pitt is also very good in the movie and is very convincing as a cia agent great job,intelligence
i havent seen this movie in awhile but i decided to complement on it robert redford and brad pitt star in this movie about a now retiring cia agent trying to get his student brad pitt out of a chinese jail in the meantime the movie goes in to flash backs of brad and him during different missions in different countries this movie had a slow pace but it had good acting and good direction my personal favorite scene was the bombing in beirut this movie makes you think so dont see with the notion of everyone just killing others and explosions figure it out you will be entertained i was never to fond of robert redford but in this movie he changes my mind about him,intelligence
brad and bob were good together but i had a hard time with the interplay between brad and catherine mccormack  the key to this movie would be that you cant just sit and watch you have to think a little  some say not enuff some say way too much  i liked the script just fine as it was  it addressed some things that need to be addressed on a large scale by the intelligence community and the people of the nation states of the world,intelligence
tthis film is a great example of the spy action genre and gives anew meaning to the term remote controlredford is his usual charismatic self and plays brilliantly as the wise old hand  pitt the rookie does a good job and more than holds his own against redford  the supporting cast are a text book case of brilliant casting all the usual suspects are present and correct in case you havent guessed this is not a particularly new story but it is one that has been very well told and and benefits from tony scotts talented direction  everything  about it has been polished and repolished until what we see is a very slick and well produced film that has some nice twists and a half intelligent story line  the fact that they evidently worked on developing the story line is becoming a rare feature of contemporary hollywood and certainly pays off in this instancea great 2 hours entertainment and well worth the 560,intelligence
responding to what the user gww1 had said about at one point redfords character says that he first met pitts character 25 years ago when they fought together in viet nam 25 years ago brad pitt was only 12 years old id like to note that the show was set in 1991 not 2001 hence they met approximately 16 years ago and not 25 as the user had stated but i guess brad pitts looks should be able to allow him to transform into a much younger tom bishop easily,intelligence
wow what can i say this film was amazing the acting was top job well done men i would love to see more of redford and pitt together like that i left the theater with this smile that wouldnt go away the deceit was innocent enough to not ruin the movie it was really a well done movie one of the best i have seen in quite a while,intelligence
is an extremely good movie and i would recommend it to everyone this movie is the best spy movie i have ever seen and clearly blows away any james bond or mission impossible movie  the action is all reality based which makes the movie seem very realistic which does not happen with most spy movies  brad pitt and robert redford gave great performances and should be recognized for them  this is a must see movie,intelligence
tony scotts starring robert redford and brad pitt is not exactly what i expected its not really an action movie its more of a thriller with some interesting insight into the operations of the cia courtesy of writer michael frost beckner its good fun with a lot of star power on the day of his retirement nathan muir redford discovers that his protg and estranged friend tom bishop pitt has been captured in china for espionage and will be executed in 24 hours not exactly what 30 year cia veteran muir had intended as his swan song apparently bishop has also gone rogue as an operative this does not fair well with impending trade status talks with china in 1991 muir must get his man out while the cia internal affairs man charles harker an great snakelike stephen dillane is out to trap muir interesting setting is in place the movie centers on muirs flashbacks to his relationship with bishop since he recruited him in vietnam in 1975 ultimately their strained relationship centers around his relationship with a mysterious woman elizabeth catherine mccormack guess what happens to rock bands happens to cia operatives this is also a weaker point of the movie the strength of the movie is in the mentor relationship between redford and pitt redford is particularly great as the seenitall before muir who is coaching his charge in how the play the game and the other game life pitt brings a energy and humanity to a spy who is ultimately disillusioned by the game he makes believable the evolution tony scott keeps up the pace along with a high tech and grand visual style the opening sequence of the movie is stunning too bad with the structure of the story redford and pitt dont spend more time on the screen together something the movie could have used more of is still well crafted entertainment,intelligence

although the movie is great and presents beirut of the 80s in a very realistic style  there was a goofwhen redford pitt and hadley were sitting in a local caf the song in the background didnt come from the era the movie is talking aboutthe movie shows beirut in the early 80s but pascal mashalani the woman singer did not start singing till the later part of the 90s and the song noor al shams is fairly recent last three years,intelligence
this tale has robert redford as a soon to retire cia agent who must defy his superiors and stage a darring rescue of his former protege brad pitt who spends most of the film getting tortured in his prison cell really this is redfords show and he proves that he still has the charisma to carry a film on his aging shoulders the storyline is somewhat predictible but the ways that redford outsmarts his cia handlers is still entertaining grade b,intelligence
i did not like this movie it was the worst robert redford movie ive seen  and as if that wasnt enough the worst brad pitt movie ive seen tooi wont bother describing the plot  something about rescuing a rogue cia agent pitt from a chinese jail  suffice to say it was pretty nonexistent  and even worse all told in cutaways and flashbacks with an overdose of pointless helicopters explosions and seenitallbefore ripoffs of half decent war and spy moviesi suppose there could have been some tension building as to whether pitt would get rescued  but there was none it was obvious from about 5 minutes in that pitt would be the subject of a rescue attempt and the movie might have been watchable if wed been unsure or even cared whether this would succeed  but hey all i cared about was that the tedious and very loud soundtrack kept waking me up i kid you not  despite the continual noise i managed to sleep through most of ittotal rubbish thank god i didnt pay good money to see it,intelligence
this movie is well directed and well acted  i have to agree with all the people who say this but the plot is not good at all after having seen enemy of the state and seing the trailer of this movie  i was really eager to see this one  i was very disappointed  the movie was plain boring  and for people who lived in beyrouth during the war  they would tell you that this movie has a lot of flaws representing this war all in all  a good movie for people who dont like to get into details and dont care about misrepresentation of a civil war,intelligence
why there isnt one single american movie that shows the world a real china as a chinese every time my country was on the hollywoods big screen i would have a really hard time recognizing it the same thing happens in this spy movie its very funny that the 1991s china looks no different from the china in 1941  poor oldfashioned clothes corrupt officials who like to watch bikiniclad women prison with almost no guard i think there is a gap between the real china and the china in americans imaginations which is expanded by hollywood movies like and many other movies in mission impossible 3 the local chinese people still wear chinese tunic suit which only appeared 30 years ago in chinese history i dont know if other countries images have also been wrenched however i sincerely hope that hollywood filmmakers could do more research before they show american people what other countries are like in this way not only can we enjoy a fascinating story but also learn more about the fact isnt that good for everyone,intelligence
a movie that makes ronin look good i thought it wasnt possible but again we have a low budget production with too many familiar uk locations the cia hq looked like a local comp the chinese jail was actually an old prison in yorkshire and it was populated by british clist actors stephen from coronation street that chap from the carlsberg ad and the mad guy from banzai with appalling american accents the one decent brit actor marianne baptiste from mike leighs secrets  lies was consigned to the role of wryhumoured secretary to robert bus pass redfordand how we laughed at the subtopgun script written it would appear by a committee of crazed baywatch fans we need this like we need a third tit you must be fing crazy youre worried the lids gonna come down with your hand in the cookie jar the whole ruse of lining up a series of flashbacks nam sortie eastern bloc escapade etc against the countdown to brad pitts final clash with a ketchup bottle was unbelievable unengaging and cheap bob shuffled around with his zimmer frame whilst brad looked mildly more animated  modelled various hairstyles  sunglasses from across the ageswe stayed to the bitter end and were rewarded with more cheese cliches and some great shots of the thames valley and guildford  multistorey car parkthe director is tony scott  ridleys brother  but he sadly shares none of his financial clout cinematographic eye or ear for good dialoguegood for a laugh,intelligence
this film had such potential  the acting wasnt bad  although i still yearn to see redford extend his acting repertoire by playing a bad guy the basic plot involving a worldweary veteran spy going out on a limb for his protg may not be original but is still pretty sound and also filled with potential however the shameful number of errors as listed on another part of this site  the unbelievable ending which would make john wayne blush all contribute to make this the sort of film that would help you to sleep on a long flight it does have its moments although its premise that the old cia was some sort of lone ranger is hard to swallow note the oxymoron on the certificate of appreciation redford gets from the director acknowledging his 30 years of honorable service  since when has the been considered honorable even by those whose career it is to sum up if spy kids was too intellectually challenging for you then maybe youll enjoy this film otherwise if your rental store has only 2 videosdvds this  one showing paint dry choose the paint,intelligence
this is the first comment i have written at imdb i just wanted to warn people to stay away from this movie if you have ever seen operation condor or sneakers this movie is the combination of both the plot is far from thrilling and the cia characters that redfords character is supposedly tricking are pathetic it is so unrealistic and it really is hard to concentrate on this movie as you want to get up and do something else all the little things redfords character are supposedly doing to trick his fellow cia people is really stupid you really need to suspend belief to believe that people that stupid could join the cia for example the scene where he leaves his cigarettes in another room to distract someone so he can steal some satellite images and their are plenty of other things to complain about but i am sure others have and will say it better then me,intelligence
the title of is perfectly suited to the film half of it is an action thriller and the other half is a cheesy comedy if you watch the preview youll hear tons of oneliners flying back and forth between robert redford and his younger self brad pitt if youre chuckling go ahead and rent it if you think its silly skip this movie and stick to three days of the condorbob and brad are cia agents the former trained and taught the latter the most memorable line from the film is when brad gestures for bob to go ahead in a shootout age before beauty this line demonstrates the real problem with the film lets face it youre either a robert redford fan who thinks brad pitt is a young upstart or youre a brad pitt fan who thinks robert redford should retire its not possible to root for both of them so in the film when brad gets captured by the chinese and bob sets out to rescue him youre either thinking stay home dont risk your neck for that kid or you dont need any help from that old timer my advice is to watch the preview thats as good as its going to get then rent your favorite film from whichever blond beauty youre partial to i know what im watching tonight old sport,intelligence
is almost a good movie unfortunately it fails to pay off on any of its worthwhile ambitionsat first it seems like some sort of inside look at the brad pitts character is going to learn something about life and morality as in a lecarre thriller pitt does eventually make a big realization but its abrupt with very little psychological leadup and the subsequent evolution of the story is barely sketched in early on pitt looks like one type of character later were told hes another type the only thing missing is the good stuff in betweenmeanwhile as we see what redfords character is up to were tempted to think this may be some sort of catandmouse intellectual exercise reminiscent of the brilliant hopscotch but redfords cleverness just isnt all that clever or even interesting he reads the back of a memo he uses the phone in a neighbouring office he steals a key card big deal not only are they banal most of these events such as his final exit from the film are completely implausible unless you put your brain on park youre constantly asking yourself but wouldnt they see that couldnt the worlds biggest spy organization just send some people to stop him arent there procedures that anticipate this sort of simple trickand again as with pitt we are left totally in the dark as far as redfords ultimate change of character why does he act against all the weighty advice he gives pitt early on in his training we see that hes undergone some sort of transformation but never given any insight into it one minute redford is an unchanging brick of a character a bastion of the amoral cia philosophy the next hes a malicious prankster with an overriding personal morality this key transformation happens offscreen like pitts with no explanation thats not clever its just annoying if i wanted to write my own movie i wouldnt be watching this onealong the way there are endless plot holes the biggest of all being the basic framework of the story why is a committee of cia top brass sitting around for two days listening to redfords reminiscences someone says its to get something on pitts character thats not remotely plausible we actually see a manufactured press item on the news at one point showing how easily the whole problem can be addressed without listening to hours of redfords banter and without giving redford hours to take action as hes left to wander unsupervised through cia headquartersisnt unpleasant to watch its nicely produced with some genuinely interesting episodes unfortunately those episodes fail to connect into a coherent whole the redford and pitt characters are intriguing but we never learn what makes them tick theyre ciphers at the end just as they were at the beginningwatching is like reading the outline of a movie a good movie to be sure maybe someone will make it someday,intelligence
this is one of the best political thriller movies i have ever watched in my entire lifetime with robert redford and brad pitt giving knockout performances throughout the entire film director tony scott really knew what he was doing behind the camera while making this excellent film turn out into being a box office successboth redford and pitt give one of the best performances in both of their entire careers as actorsthe movie itself will keep you on the edge of your seat you wouldnt be able to pause the movie if you watch it either on dvd or on tv if you never ever seen this epic thriller before in your entire life however this picture is on my list for the best movies of 2001,intelligence
some movies get better with age  just like the two main actors of this splendid thriller robert redford now 77 and brad pitt now 50 as written by michael frost beckner and david arata and directed with distinction by tony scott reminds us how thrilling films of this ilk can be without the need for computer generated aliens or vampires or werewolves or zombies or outrageous extraterrestrial effects etc the dialogue is smart balanced with humor when appropriate and played with a fine assemblage of actors who know how to terrify us simply by telling a visual storycia operative nathan muir robert redford is on the brink of retirement when he finds out that his protg tom bishop brad pitt has been arrested in china for espionage no stranger to the machinations of the cias top echelon muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to free bishop as he embarks on his mission to free bishop muir recalls how he recruited and trained the young rookie at that time a sergeant in vietnam their turbulent times together as operatives and the woman who threatened their friendship there is of course the requisite female agent catherine mccormack a top member of the cia stephen dillane who allows us to see how corrupt that organization can be and the ever grounded secretary marianne jeanbaptiste to remind us that the people involved in this world wide intrigue are really just human beings  even if they misbehave in their jobsmade in 2001 this film remains a skillful winner  just the ticket for watching in the stifling heat of summer time and it is such a pleasure to watch the magic that redford and pitt weave highly recommended and it is so very timely in 2013 grady harp,intelligence
a fast paced thriller like this with lots of background needs some careful setting up and there wasnt much sophistication in the way it was done but it worked surprisingly well consideringas others have pointed out there were some pedestrian errors in the props and sets not to mention tom bishops brad pitt apparently ageless body not the directors fault though he should have spotted at least some of these timelines were skewed and there were some glaring historical errorsthe ambitious charles harker stephen dillane drove the plot forward with force so we could compare that with muirs redford delicate more productive touch muir and harker had some interesting interplay which was cleverly written well acted and nicely presented with great camera work kudos to tony scott elizabeth hadley cat mccormack was an effective spanner in the works as the ambiguous gobetween though i feel that tom bishop brad pitt took a big risk to get her back when in a few months she could be back in beirut bishops difficulty with the harsh realities of his work were a bit thin he must have known the risks he was taking not just for himself but for others in any way connected with him muirs rooftop warning seemed a little late muir had more faith in his protg than he possibly deserved perhaps but it was well phrased well delivered and the filming of it worked exceptionally well for its novelty according to the dvd extras tony scott stumped up 50k of his own money to pay for the helicopter to film that scene when the backers refused robert redford consistently performs well whilst i dont feel he has much range hes pretty much always redford in any role he makes up for it with intelligent shading of nuance brad pitt gets by in a wooden way nothing normally against him in interview with the vampire he and cruise were outstanding but this role called for nothing more than his usual bag of tricksan entertaining film with a nice balance of pacey action and thoughtful dialogue,intelligence
i love a good spy movie however this was not a good spy movie it appears to have been a novel that the director tried to transfer to the big screen less like lecarre and more like seuss for starters it was boring i kept waiting for some action the only action was the 27 seconds of shotsand how annoying was that robert redford and brad pitt both looked very weatheredtwo handsome men wasted the only exciting part of the movie was the beating of pitt by the chineseand that was fractured pun intended there could have been more romance to develop pitts love interest the two helicopters next to each other was so corny certain things were missing good direction good script and good movie,intelligence

is a 2001 directed by tony scott and starring robert redford and brad pitt redford plays nathan muir a cia man getting ready to retire on his last day he finds out that one of his operatives tom bishop brad pitt is in a chinese prison awaiting execution after a series of meetings in which he recounts his relationship with bishop including his recruitment it occurs to him that because of an upcoming trade conference the cia is going to let bishop be executedi remember this film receiving horrific reviews when it was released in fact with two great stars and top direction its not bad at all theres a lot of action and the complicated story which could have been a muddled mess is well toldmy only problem with this film  i know this sounds shallow  is the way robert redford looks i was around when he first became popular and  well even in 2001 he was looking pretty old i find it sad that such a gorgeous man has aged so atrociously i commend him for not going the plastic surgery route and its obvious he considered his looks a curse rather than a blessing thankfully he continues to make wonderful contributions to film wrinkles and all,intelligence
this one was a big surprise for me im usually not a fan of espionage films nor am i usually a fan of brad pitt this movie was a pleasant surprise on both counts and i really enjoyed it the plot is very good for a bigbudget hollywood movie i was interested from beginning to end all the performances are great and every character is unique you almost feel sorry for some characters while others are there simply for comic relief no matter which they may be everyone involved succeeds at their purpose i really like redfords characterit wasnt really anything new for him but he was still funny and just plain cool the director handled the plot very well its not very hard to figure out but he still finds ways to keep you interested and wondering if your assumptions are correct i definitely recommend this one810,intelligence
robert redbord and brad pitt at their best it is a wonderful film on friendship and the price that has to be paid to stick to it eg by going with all available means against persons in an organization that only worry about their careers and would sell not only their colleagues but even their mothers for it friendship keeps people alive literally and metaphorically speaking friendship in the first place between muir redford and pitt bishop but also between pitt and his girlfriend in the prison and between muir and his secretary and other persons that help him in rescuing bishop from the prison in china at the beginning of the film one would think muir is like james bond but muir becomes more of a character it turns out that he is not only a professional in intelligence work and in educating new agents but what is nicest muir has a heart of goldhe helps bishop even though their relationship deteriorated due to the problems with bishops girlfriend,intelligence
i just saw this movie and i really flew out of my seat i didnt know that brad pitt could act and not just show his face on the screen and save the box officei really like bob redford here too he is really good as an old time working cia manthe directions of tscott was ok and the story that takes us through the vietnam var too the end of the cold war was belivible i like the whole production of the movie and give if two thumbs up and my small toejoakim helm,intelligence
the movie makes the cia look good to paraphrase president kennedy the successes of the cia are not told their failures are known both robert redford and brad pitt are exceptional actors it is a real treat to see them in a movie together redford plays a high ranking cia officer named nathan muir who flashes back to working with pitts character tom bishop garrick hagon plays cia director cy wilson with style will muir be able to get wilson to free bishop from china watch this cliffhanger film and find out operation dinner out is silly name for an op something like operation twin galaxies sounds more grandiose my stepmother is chinese and i have come to appreciate subtle chinese humor if an alien species ever demanded humans to fight then america and china could fight a war on terrorism helping each other in a letter to the chinese leadership first president bush spoke of the close ties america has with china going back to president nixon secretary of state kissinger and triangular diplomacy the great military stategist sun tzu once said feign confusion and destroy the enemy it may look like there are too many american intelligence agencies but there is really only the american secret service i think that there is something special about each american president and a sequel to spygame should have someone playing the american president,intelligence
on the day of his retirement cia handler nathan muir is asked for all his files on onetime protg tom bishop  a source tells muir that the reason is that bishop has been captured while on a mission concealing the majority of his files muir gets himself involved in the meeting and finds himself desperately trying to help bishop from the inside with others within the agency seemingly happy to have bishop executed as a criminal rather than reveal he is an agent muir tries to buy time while he tells the backstory of his relationship with bishop and how he came to be where he was when capturedwith average reviews all around this film i decided to not bother with it at the cinema and to wait for television to get it almost four years later i finally got round to it and i must admit that i dont regret waiting that long the first hour actually works pretty well despite being mostly very talky it is interesting slick clever and quite fun to watch but it starts to fall apart at the halfway mark at this point the backstory starts to become more important and less convincing at the same time meanwhile muirs clever manipulations start to become more and more outlandish and unlikely this is a problem because a tight and enjoyable little espionage story becomes baggy and starts to lose the pace it had while also seeing the logic falling away at the same time it is still ok but it became distinctly more and more average as it went on and settled into a rather unremarkable conclusion that could have been much betterthe polished cast do reasonably well but not as well as the hype about the redfordpitt partnership would have you believe redford does well with his office based stuff even if he does look a bit old in his flashback scenes  not a major problem of course just an observation he is confident and tricky and he makes for a good lead pitt is less able and struggles with some of the flashbacks while also being lumbered being a romantic subplot that although key to the plot just doesnt work the support cast are all good although there are a few weak links in there mostly down to the material they are given but the film belongs to redford on the whole and he does a pretty good joboverall this is an ok film but nothing more than that the potential shown at the start is never really fully realised and the second half starts to go downhill scotts direction is good throughout but he cannot keep the early pace and intrigue that the film had in the first half it is still enjoyable but by the end of the film i was distinctly underwhelmed and could see why it had gotten soso reviews when it was released in the cinema,intelligence
the movie has a very complex structure with some flashback sequences that are very good but really do nothing to advance the plot of the movie i ended up having to watch the movie again afterwards skipping through the flashbacks to follow the plot more closely where the movie can spend twenty minutes on an incidental piece of background character history important plot points are casually thrown out in single sentences perhaps the audience is expected to pick up these subtleties from the chaff  but i found it tiresome there are other points which make the movie quite confusing while its good to see british actors playing nonstereotyped roles in hollywood movies i was quite confused as to why so many cia employees had london accents in particular at the beginning of the movie we see the very underrated actor david hemmings talking in his shakesperean british accent entering what is quite obviously lloyds of london it took me sometime to understand that the character was an american in a building in hong kong this strikes me as the equivalent of clint eastwood walking into the empire state building pretending to be an italian in rome also i couldnt understand why the movie was set in 1991  why not make it present day especially as no attempt was made to capture the period in fashion technology etc and its asking a bit much for us to believe that a military operation can be authorised simply by forging the signature of the dci the plot is thoughtful and interesting however there needed to be much more character development and background perhaps this rather than dwelling on the lessrelevant setpiece flashbacks for instance it isnt immediately clear that redfords character is trying to obstruct the cia guys and when it does become apparent there is little explanation this is especially odd as we are shown redford in flashback as being a towtheline kind of agent little more than professional respect for pitt i wish the movie had shown what made redford want to take this course of action why he felt the need to save pitt i really wanted to like this movie in fact i think i would have preferred to read it as a clancyesque novel it has a very good premise and there are outstanding performances by redford and pitt while the supporting actors are all strong the cinematography is also excellent with innovative use of different framerate filming angles fast and slow motion and some great use of locations it seemed to me though that this is prevented from being a polished movie by some rather amateurish errors in judgment,intelligence
this movie is just plain awesome it has a great premise too it and the flashback scenes are awesome i loved how they show how a cia agent gets trained and how you use people to get what you want the cast is top notched and very believable in their roles i however thought the whole flashback scenes with wht was going did not make much sense to me and spent way to long on it when they were discussing what to do about brad pitt overall good action,intelligence
i have to admit that brad pitt is one of my favorite actors i dont know if its the acting specifically but he is been in so many movies that i like seven fight club oceans eleven and this has to be his best movie yet this movie is very suspenseful i am not an expert on the cia and how realistic this movie is but i have to say that it was gripping after the first scene and full of tension the rest of the movie robert redford is also amazing in this movie for an old guy he comes off as very cool,intelligence
a very smart film containing profundity intrigue great characters and top actorsa real friendship and love story cia in detail and a fantastic screen shot that could initiate a new style of camera work at filming pace tony scott achieves a wonderful contrast among the beginning scene including the many overfast reflections and the perfect melodramatic and chess gameat cia sceneseach one give the film an outstanding atmosphere  authentic tragic and mystifying the discussion between redford and pitt on the roof is one of the greatest scenes in film history so the film it is  one of the best i have seen a long time ago,intelligence
contains spoilers    well at least currently my favorite movie  my all time favorite would have to be fight club  as you may have figured out im a pretty big brad pitt fan which is the main reason i saw this movieokay well talk about the bad aspects first there werent many obviously this movie wasnt setting out to be the next james bond or true lies  they were looking to portray a more accurate story of what spies do i believe they succeeded at this on most levels however it still felt a bit like hollywood  also catherine mccormack was decent as the love interest but not that great  i dont really think she held up well opposite pitt and redfordokay the good aspects  i thought that pitt and redfords performances were amazing  i loved their characters  robert redford was obviously one of the best spies that the cia had  everything was by the book  as far as he was concerned if you deviate from the plan even a little bit you run too great a risk of blowing the operation  perhaps my favorite scene was on the rooftop in berlin after brad pitt had to leave one of his assets behindtom nathan what happened what went wrong nathan nothing tom nothing nathan actually one thing dont ever question me again ever tom what nathan i give you an order you take it  you dont ask why  that ten seconds on the phone could have blown the op tom the op was bringing schmidt across nathan the op was setting up ann cathcart and your end had to look legit tom what are you telling me schmidt was bait nathan yes tom nathan they executed him on a shy cellar floor nathan and it could have been you and let me tell you something about schmidt he went to the russians a week ago and said he had an american contact someone he could use tom dont tell me that  dont fing tell me that  you didnt look into his eyes  dont tell me that nathan he was your asset someone you use for information tom ahhh jesus christ  you dont just trade these people like theyre baseball cards  this is not a fing game nathan yes it is  and this is no kids game either this is a whole other type of game  and its serioius and its dangerous and its not one you wanna lose tom nathan we killed this man  we used him and we killed him nathan says nothing tom okay then you gotta help me understand this one nathan what are we doing here  and dont gimme some bullshit about the greater good nathan thats exactly what it is  because unfortunately what we do is very necessary and if youre not willing to sacrifice scum like schmidt for those who want nothing more than their freedom then you better take a long hard look at your chosen profession my friend because it doesnt get any easier you wanna walk  you wanna walk  walk tom you shoulda told me about the op  you used me nathan i did and listen to this cuz this is important if you were to pull some crazy stunt over there if you were to get nabbed i wouldnt come after you  you go off the reservation i will not come after you gets up and walks away tom fk your rules nathan looks back nathan okay  but tonight they saved your lifeyoull notice from that scene that redfords character nathan followed the rules so strictly and was so careful about not getting caught or anyone he was responsible for not getting caught that he was willing to sacrifice one of their informants life  youll notice at the end of the movie however that nathan did rescue tom from pulling some crazy stunt  this goes to show how much nathan actually cared for tomnathan also taught bishop to put away some money so you can die some place warm  dont ever touch it  not for anyone  if it comes to you or them send flowers  nathan had saved up 282 000 for his retirement that he spent without hesitation to get tom out of the chinese prisonbasically tom ended up changing nathan  the student teaching the teacher nathan wasnt following the rules so rigidly by the end of the moviewhew okay i gotta go to class  so im gonna write down my less inteligent thoughts really quick  i thought that the blue and white jacket brad pitt had on during the scene where he was being trained was sweeeeeet  i want it  i thought the fact that the movie took place over sixteen years was convincing enough  pitt and redford dont seem to get much older in real life either  i guess pitt was supposed to go from early twenties to late thirties and redford from early forties to late fifties  convincing enough i thought  oh and yes im aware that its quite frightening that i knew that scene off by heart  ive just watched the movie so many timesanyway i loved this movie  great acting action and plot 910,intelligence
has the roots of a workable premise but is sabotaged by bludgeoning pretentiousness heavy reliance on stylistic gimmickery and a complete lack of empathyworthy characters described by some as an intelligent thinking film this ludicrous mess is anything but the running length of the film would be barely adequate time to catalog the plot holes alone since i love a good spy caper i had high hopes for this one but i was left feeling manipulated underestimated  and disappointedspoilers aheadthe trendy videoinfluenced camera work and editing can be appreciated aesthetically in and of itself but as a substitute for style and pacing it is merely annoying the flashback scene transitions are heavyhanded for example redfords character begins his fond recall of his days in vietnam organising assassinations so what do we get cue stereotypical nam era rocknroll and i kid you not sepiatoned film stock this is to suggest  what that it is a flashback fine but then one must use sepiatoning for all the flashbacks to suggest it was the good old days its an empty stylistic gesture in a film packed to the limit with themthe entire framing story of the chinese prison could easily have been jettisoned to concentrate on the more interesting story of of the two agents and the evolution of the surrogate fatherson angle ultimately ending with pitts characters change of heart about the business and redfords characters reaction to same which brings me to my biggest problem with this film why am i supposed to care about any of these people tom bishop is a cia assassin and spy turned rogue who may grimace a bit but still manages to leave a trail of bodies the girl hadley is an admitted terrorist who has bombed a building and killed government officials nathan muir is a blackops specialist who freely spends lives and organises bombings in a cavalier fashion but we are supposed to like him because he is nice to his secretary and if i heard right in the film muir is the one who had hadley kidnaped off the streets of beirut and traded to the chinese in the first place what a pal eh muir has some lines about being the good guys and having a purpose but he is actually the most reprehensible character in the film not discernably different than the terrorists he eliminatesbishop and hadley are in actuality both entirely guilty of what they are accused of and the chinese are within their rights to have imprisoned them and muir is supposedly redeemed at the end by the fact that he used his retirement fund to finance the improbable rescue mission pardon me but didnt he make that money bombing and assassinating people then having outwitted the lummoxes in charge of the cia he drives off into the sunset in his porschepleasefor an intelligent spy movie see the spy who came in from the cold ive seen detergents that leave a better film than ,intelligence

having been led to believe that was a film worth seeing i have to admit to being badly let down although the lead performers produced an average performance i found the rest of the film a complete disappointmentthe plot was totally unbelievable and simply left the viewer with more questions than answers just to name a few items which beggared believebeirut looked suspiciously like somewhere in florida or perhaps california just how come a cia operative became part of a medical team giving shots to prisoners in a chinese jail was never explained there are a lot more points that i could pick up on but i cannot be botheredthe ending was predictable right from the moment that the operative became a prisoner of the chinesein summaryif you are one of those who likes to sit and watch a film without thinking about it at all and accepting it as just a load of trivial nonsense or perhaps have nothing better to do then this is the film for you if on the other hand you are one who expects to get something other than unbelievable nonsense from a movie then you should defiantly look else wherekeith,intelligence

if one wants to see a feelgoodmovie the presence of robert redford always is a guarantee the plot here is rather clever redford is ironic hes character is winning the game towards the cia bosses but the problem with this movie is that it is too much of 1985 this is an oldfashioned way of making a spy thrillerbrad pitt has his limitations as always better playing although mostly making a funny caricature comes from stephen dillam anyway there are better ways of spending two hours than seeing this film,intelligence
the problem with the movie was simply that it wasnt particularly exciting and had no other compensating qualities the action scenes were nothing special and failed to draw the viewer into the situation by the end of the movie i was so bored with the protagonists that i was rooting for the bad guys,intelligence
really terrible plot storyline and only mediocre acting the writer obviously borrowed some ideas from well known books and other movies ie the training exercise where pitt has to appear in the balcony of a window is taken from a book about a mossad officer and possibly other sources and the facts are not accurate ie embassy bombing in lebanon where 211 civilians killed in mid 1980s maybe theyre thinking of the marine barracks that were bombed and 245 marines were killedbesides all of that the story just drags on with no real purpose the idea is that pitt has been captured by the chinese in an attempt to free some political prisoner the cia wants to know what pitt was doing when he got captured and then decide what to do about it  ignore deny it or try to help him the whole movie is then just redford rambling on about how he met pitt recruited trained and worked with him none of this would seem to have a bearing on the alleged plotstory line had many flaws as well beware  spoilers ahead why would a highly trained and experienced spy pitt make a stupid mistake like giving chewing gum to some unknown prisoner during a dangerous missionwhy would he even have gum with him why would pitt risk his life to save this woman he only barely knew some 6 years previous and who left him with only a dear john letter as far as he knew why would redford throw away his life savings retirement house in the bahamas and risk jail time to get pitt out of prison when they didnt even like each other and hadnt spoken in the past 6 years not to mention redfords rules about not risking anything for resources whatever  i dont mind farfetched plots when that is the pretext for the movie but when they try to play it off as factual and believable then all of this gibberish is irksomelast but not least  the acting is uninspired and bland personally i think redford is overrated as an actor and pitt has had better performancesi could go on but this movie doesnt warrant it ive already spent more effort on this comment than the writers directors producers actors et spent making the movie i rate it a 310,intelligence

utterly nothing new or surprising here  redford  pitt and director tony scott sleepwalk their way through a completely standard action flick that includes standard cutesy dialogue between the two leads routine explosions the star outwitting everyone and a one in a million shot ending  redford has a few good lines as the lead but it just annoys me when these government agencybased movies portray everyone in said agency as cold heartless idiots and the star as the one character with the heart of gold and is constantly able to outwit and this is most important get the last and most clever oneliner in  the romance pitt is in is throughly unconvincing as well  there is nothing horribly offensive here but youve seen it too many times already,intelligence
this is a guy movie definitely and what makes a guy movie any movie where the hero has to call in air support and theres a gratuitous fly by of an aircraft carrier is a guy movie actually these are elements of an american guy movie which slickbrit director tony scott is a past master at is so nauseatingly superficial at times especially scotts keeness to use digital effects money shots and camera techniques that went out of fashion on mtv a decade ago there is one ludicrous seen where redford and pitt have coffee on the roof of a berlin office building for no other reason it appears than to let tony scott lens it from a circling helicopter which produces such dizziness as to distract you entirely from the script actually any distraction from the script is good we like that because the script and plot is along the lines of we are the good guys but sometimes that requires us being bad so maybe were not the good guys this sees pitt responsible for the deaths of several apparently innocent individuals and redford fighting at the cusp of retirement from the connivance of his cia colleagues as they seek to hang him and pitt out to dry in reality is no less risible vacuous or entertaining though slower than your average bond movie but its the pretensions to some kind of moral and intellectual weight that annow rather than just revelling in kiss kiss bang bang,intelligence
there is very little redemptive value to this movie the music is pretty good  thats about it the acting is soso the story is probably fine as a book i am usually a fairly forgiving movie viewer with regard to anachronisms and factual errors but this one is just inexplicable why in the world does brad pitt and robert redford look exactly the same in 1975 as they do in 1991 with the exception of some pastedon sideburns ill tell you why because even with all of the magic hollyweird can conjure up they still cant make robert redford not look like he is 65 and brad pitt not look like hes 30something i just could not get past this and found myself dwelling on makeup anachronisms and other errors throughout the movie  it ruined it for me dont bother with this one,intelligence
okay so the beginning was pretty exciting when tom bishop brad pitt had to rescue the girl in a chinese prison but after brad pitt gets caught for espionage the story changes it focuses more on the past of nathan muir robert redford and tom bishop on how they met how he trained him and stuff and when they arent reliving the past they would be just keep talking and talking in the meeting questioning nathan muir which was soo boring this movie talks way too much and moves really really slow i couldnt wait until the movie was over i saw people leaving the theater which i also kind of wanted to do at one point but i gave this movie a shot but man the ending is not worth it at all i was more interested on what was happening to brad pitt in the prison instead of his past life and all this talking in the meeting roomokay so the action scenes were realistic if they didnt have them then we would all think this movie stink but they did do a good job of making this movie seem real but the story was boringlast note the part where the asians were watching baywatch was lame nobody even laughed at that scene either because they also thought it was lame but the movie made us soo tired we couldnt even laugh510,intelligence
robert redford plays george smiley could have been the title for this film had it been given a better script but with redford in the lead we know he has to be cool and superior to the dummies around him and as soon as you read the cast list on the box of the dvd you know we are in for a happy ending and one without the complexities that the two wonderful british spy novelist in my title give to their worksbrad pitt who seems to specialize in long long films like this and joe black is believable as the hot shot wonderboy but whos going to believe this hunk can be running around mideighties beirut looking no older than he did in 1975 and not draw attention what he plays is et or jeff bridges character from starmanan alien who needs to be protected from the bad scientists at the cia of course they are not scientists but rather desk men protecting their fief but the principle is the samethe old method was to put characters in cars and have them drive fast to keep an action plot moving today directors ramp up the music and use quick cuts to try to keep our interest sometimes this works here it doesnt because every so often the scriptwriters have to launch into a whats it all about alfie discussion between redford and pitt in martin ritts spy from the cold the dirty business is not revealed until nearly the end and with what heartbreaking force that revelation comes here leamas and girlfriend surviveand like et get to go home,intelligence
cis a confusing and busy movie it can be said that this is a smart persons movie but the fact is it is actually just a simple formula that wants to be confusing thus it can surprise or stun its audience with a simple conclusion it will just have people who completely understand the movie or people who just scratch their headsthe movie is about a soontobe retired cia agent named nathan muir robert redford it chooses this route so that is complicates things for nathanbrad pitt stars as tom bishop a man who has been arrested in hong kong for espionage and will be put to death in 24 hours giving muir a time limit also complicates things in fact the movie is so busy complicating things it forgets to entertain and thrill us muir spends half the movie sitting in a room talking to the board of directors and the other half in flashbacks with bishop muir tell the board about how he and bishop used to talk and how muir trained him we see different meeting and things between the two men we see things from different missions and wars we flash back and forth about ninety times and get lost in what story is what and what muir is even talking aboutthe main problem is the movie has way too many cuts back and forth it needs to stay simple and just do one thing at a time it gets really busy as the movie progresses the board of directors at first seem to care about bishop then just dont its never clear what side theyre on and really we didnt even need to see any of the stuff with the board the movie is about how he tries to free bishop but it never really gets to that until the last twenty minutesit could have been a better movie instead of doing it in flashbacks why not just start from the beginning the first half hour or say fortyfive minutes could have been about bishops training and what not then have the rest of the movie be a raceagainsttime thriller where muir works endlessly to free bishop that may sound formulaic but at least it would be entertaining but no they chose the boring way outand another thing the cinematography and camera work was really annoying the camera zooms and zangs around while we are trying to see whats going on this only works in one scene where bishop and muir are on a roof having a discussion also the background music changes constantly its like the music coordinators just picked sounds at random and put them in the vocalizing got on my nerves so badly then theres the wiztech music that just seemed out of placehas the feel of a better movie but just sticks to the boring confusing annoying and tiresome script that weve seen just way too many times,intelligence
i was pretty disappointed with buying this movie boring for the most partthe description on the back sounds better than what really happens most of the movie is about nathan muir robert redford talking about tom bishop brad pit in their past to other members of the cia he works withtom is captured in a cheese prison while trying to save a woman he used to love his ex boss nathan tries to figure out how to get him out before toms execution in 24 hourshow the rescue of tom turns out seems too easy the way it happened seemed too quick and didnt have anyone after them it doesnt show what happens when the cheese realize tom is gonehad the movie not been mostly flashbacks of the past and been about people trying to get tom out in a rescue mission i would have enjoyed itnone of the people nathan discussed his past with tom to didnt do anything to help him it helped explain toms job and the relationship with nathan but other than that it is pointless,intelligence
there was a good film here struggling to get out but unfortunately it wasnt allowed to when you spend most of the film trying to work out how old redford is suppose to be and how old he really is and thinking when hes suppose to be 16 years younger that he does actually look a lot younger you know somethings wrong tony scott has made some damn fine action movies but here hes badly misjudged things with excessively bombastic direction and tiresome uninvolving flashbacks that take up most of the films two hours theres one point about an hour in when things start to get interesting as redford tries to fool the cia but this lasts just a few minutes and then were back to flashbacks the only thing that keeps you watching is redford whos still as charismatic as ever 510,intelligence
looks as though it could have been directed by tony scotts brother ridley  that wasnt a complimentthere is the kernel of a good movie here   we see it when nathan is training tom in the ways of spycraft handing out snap tests find out something about that woman walking a dog bluff your way onto one of the balconies of that building within five minutes telling us secrets about what spies do that are so intriguing it doesnt matter if theyre true or false  if scott cant see that this material is gold while everything else he has to work with is lead with the occasional streak of silver or iron theres no hope for himbut in order for any of this material to shine we have to be able to see it  and all we could see were pretentious arty gimmicks thrown together with no sense of rhythm or style  theyre not even good pretentious arty gimmicks  heres what passes for flair in a scott film when were told that the chinese plan to execute tom in just 24 hours robert redford is frozen as a black and white photo with the legend 802pm printed underneath this gesture like most gestures is accompanied by the metallic whoosh of a steel tub brushing the side of a wind tunnel just in case we missed the point  throughout the day we see more such photos of redford with similar legends 230pm 1134pm or whatever one of these photo legends even has in brackets beneath it execution at 800am  just in case wed missed the point  the camera sweeps in when it should stay stillflies through the sky in fast motion when it has nothing better to do zooms in on the trivial and from start to finish the film is the wearying sequence of cut cut cut thats the first sign of poverty of imagination on at least someones part  scott can cut all he wants it wont disguise that none of his footage and none of his gimmickry has any life  some directors can take equally vapid stuff and give it a soul  he has no ear for music either  the score is unspeakably dreadfulits the kind of film which starts out looking a little bit lame and within a mere five or three or even just two years looks crashingly obviously ludicrously lame,intelligence
when brad pitt recently said i am completely bored with myself in films you get the feeling he mustve meant this one in particular the direction is slow and plodding the story is both dull and ludicrous at the same time and the filmmakers are sloppy with the details they dont pay attention to them and they hope you wont eitherthe film begins with it being the last day of work for the old pro robert redfordat the cia he learns that an agent and good friend brad pitt that he personally recruited and trained has been captured by the chicoms and is scheduled to be executed in 24 hours of course the cia disavows any knowledge of pitt and is willing to let him go down so it is up to redford to try and find a way to save his friendthe picture is far less interesting than this might sound told in a series of dull flashbacks from 1991 the filmmakers believe a little soft focus is all it needs to turn robert redfords increasingly craggy features from a man of  63 to a man of 47 again and brad pitt from a man of 32 to one of 16 wait that cant be right i guess he must be playing 36 so he was 20 in the flashbacks okay but none of that explains how he manages to wear the blue baseball cap of the san diego padres in beirut in 1985 while the padres wore brown caps at the time the blue caps were not introduced until 1994 but no matter that is just a small example of the filmmakers aversion to getting the details righta much larger example comes when redford is questioned by his superiors about pitt in a secure room where everything said is taped and transcribed however redford successfully gets around this by talking on the phone all this security and the phones are not monitored please i have better security anyway i think you get the idea its really too bad because both redford and pitt are muy macho and good actors to boot its too bad they picked such a forgettable project to team together in theres not even any good hotties to distract one from this slow motion machineif brad wants to stop boring people with his films i would advise him to look for better scripts for bobby redford i would advise him to talk to his old pal paul newman about allowing himself to play older characters newman has managed a nice transition from hunky leading man to older leading man and it is a transition redford is overdue forfinally i advise you to skip this movie entirely and go rent three days of the condor an infinitely better robert redfordcia movie he made in 1975 ironically the same year this movie has him training pitt to be a cia operative in vietnam  in that movie redford is a cia agent code named condor who becomes a man on the run when he returns to his new york decoding office after lunch and finds everyone has been murdered it costars john houseman faye dunaway cliff robertson and max von sydow it is one of senor socks favorite movies ever that does not star denise richards senorsock gotosenorsock,intelligence

3 march 2016 rarely does a spy movie come out that offers both action thrills and substantive mind games what makes this spy movie unique is its use of action as a backdrop to the real cerebral activities going on this is a mental movie like a mystery genre but the mystery isnt who done it but how and if it will be done the use of flashbacks are superlative in connecting the movie with concurrent past and present action going on the audience is offered a brilliant sequence of simultaneous stories that interweave in profuse delight the storyline is so straight forward that the narrative is allowed to become more qualitative than quantitative the emotional tension begins at the very start of the movie and continues through out the story depicts real espionage tactics allows the audience to experience betrayal loss and human connections this is a humanistic and penetrating look at espionage and its impact on people not a superficial action thriller,intelligence

i wanted to review this film so someone else wouldnt make the same mistake of watching it this movie had a slightly weird feeling from the beginning and i was expecting it to get better but unfortunately it didnt i was bothered by the time span of the events of two decades with the actors looking exactly the same throughout the movie also the plot is sort of messy at times well its sort of simple actually its basically redfords character reviewing the past events involving his proteg who is in trouble in a chinese prison due to some tepid love story dont get me started on the implausible rescue mission the movie has some merits too such as the cinematography and the street scenes the plot however fails miserably i wanted to like this and have liked low paced agent stories such as the good shepherd and tinker tailor soldier spy but this one does not rise even near them,intelligence
director tony scott is no newcomer in directing military thrillers and stories of political intrigue his past films include top gun crimson tide and enemy of the state this is not new ground for actor robert redford either redford plays nathan muir a cia operative on his last day on the job at different points redfords character reminded me of his previous characters in all the presidents men three days of the condor and sneakersin both actor and director live up to the standards set by these previous works and on occasion even manage to transcend redfords nathan muir is recruiter and mentor for protg tom bishop capably portrayed by brad pitt like this years training day the center of the film is the tension between the cynical somewhat jaded veteran and the starryeyed idealist rookie like this years tailor of panama or oliver stones salvador there is a love interest that complicates the relationship between the two men in an odd twist of casting fate catherine mccormack braveheart dangerous beauty plays the love interest in this film and in tailor of panamathe central debate that drives the film is the ethics of espionage what means are justified by particular desired ends the question is certainly a relevant and important question in the current political context the plot in brief is protg becomes a rogue spy in order to save his love interest and veteran becomes a rogue in order to save his protgany good thriller has to have sufficient twists and turns to keep us guessing and s does not disappoint the story is well written and director scott does a good job of making the story come to life the performances by pitt and mccormack are solid performances but redfords nathan muir is the central character and redford makes the most of the part in fact i have difficulty imagining another acting playing the part after watching redford at work the redford persona that started with the sundance kid comes through in the worldweary somewhat cynical nathan muiri was tempted to review harry potter this week i liked it for engaging fantasy and escape harry potter is hard to beat i suspect however that harry potter fans have already seen the film and harry potter detractors will see it when hogwarts academy freezes over if you are ready for a film that will keep you engaged and stimulate conversations about realpolitik in the modern era or if you want to see redford at the top of his game is worth a look,intelligence
this spy thriller opens in china in 1991 as an ambulance approaches a prison once there its occupants start inoculating the prisoners one of the doctors fakes his own death before trying to break out one of the prisoners he is nearly gets out but is caught at the last moment it emerges that he is cia operative tom bishop but the agency isnt keen to help him even when the chinese announce that he is to be executed the next day his operation wasnt authorised and acknowledging him could threaten an upcoming trade dealas the cia decide what to do they call in nathan muir a case officer who is retiring that day because he was the man who recruited bishop as he tells them key details about bishop we see flashbacks of his recruitment in vietnam and operations in east berlin and beirut which ultimately explain just what he was doing in china we also see muir making moves to help rescue bishop without the knowledge of his superiorsthis is a solid spy thriller even if its central conceit is a little farfetched it was interesting that between the opening where bishop was captured until his ultimate rescue we only glimpsed him in captivity he wasnt a superagent like bond or bourne instead the flashbacks show him in action where he is forced to make compromises that ultimately leads to his disillusion brad pitt does an impressive job as bishop but it is robert redford who stands out in the role of muir not an action man but a plausible character who uses contacts to save bishop rather than getting in physical danger himself that doesnt mean there is no tension though there is the feeling that he could be caught and if he was bishop would certainly be doomed the action we do see is mostly plausible even if the final rescue requires some suspension of disbelief as it involves us forces actually going into china there are some flaws that are pretty basic such as references to a us embassy in honk kong rather than a consulate and referring to hong kong china when hong kong was a british dependent territory in 1991 silly early mistakes that make one wonder what other details are wrong overall this might not be a must see film id still recommend it to fans of the genre,intelligence
retiring cia agent nathan muir robert redford recalls his training of tom bishop brad pitt while working against agency politics to free him from his chinese captorsthis is the perfect role for robert redford after day of the condor and before captain america this is a great early2000s spy thriller and redford has distinguished himself in those roles this seems like it would pair well with tinker tailor soldier spy they are both spies looking back on their career trying to figure things out different yet similarpitt is also a great choice because he is in many ways a younger redford in his personality and presence will that continue as pitt ages perhaps if anything he has become a bigger player than even redford managed to be,intelligence
2001 dir tony scott  cast robert redford brad pitt catherine mccormack david hemmings stephen dillane superb film about our attitude towards violence and danger shown mainly through flashbacks regarding the relationship between robert redford and brad pitt when an operation goes wrong an agency wishes to give reason for the chinese to execute pitt whom is captured and tortured redford acts on behalf of pitt and is questioned but underneath he is thinking beyond them we learn that they met in vietnam and were involved in many combat operations pitt became involved with a woman whom redford viewed as bad news while formula in structure the film is entertaining and directed with insight by tony scott who also made true romance and the hunger here he does a war film that is a far cry to that overrated farce he made called top gun redford is clever in his dealings around the corrupt officials who are applying pressure pitt is seen mainly through torture segments but flashbacks broaden his back story catherine mccormack plays the mysterious woman involved with pitt whom redford cannot quite trust david hemmings is a fine actor but wasted in a flat role the film is well made visually but its message doesnt seem to be as played up as the action the result is an insightful and entertaining film at best score 9   10,intelligence

id missed the until it came on cable tonightthis is probably tony scott at his best a twisted tale on the meaning of silent understanding of organizations and the complexity of the modern world if only tony had been there to direct mosesredford can carry a movie like few others and i was happy to see brad pitt put to good use too the scenes in vietnam east germany and beirut were unexceptionally great toothere was remarkably little sentimentality or the alltoocommon romantic addons in the story an almostbritish cynicism did a favor for the movie why i only give eight points is because of the ending the trump card is a bit too thick but still quite passable i was happier with the storyline than the finale but the latter is good enough,intelligence
the only reason i do not give this movie a 10 is because of some apparent flaws but for once i am forgiving them all for a great story this is after all not based on true events no need to get the facts right i loved the soundtrack it put a lot of depth into the story seen it now 5 times will see it again for any fan of brad pitt this movie is a must his portray of the frustrated vietnam vet behind a desk in germany is well done robert redford is never bad and excels as well and the thing with dinner out a touching masterpiece also for anyone into spy movies i recommend this one,intelligence
although ive actually known people who worked for the cia i lived just a few miles from cia headquarters in langley like most americans i know almost nothing about what its really like to be a spy but i know for certain its nothing like james bond movies i have an idea that the spy business may be a bit more like this film portrays so for realness ill give the plot of this film relatively high marksand the acting is top notch was robert redford ever not at least very good in a film hes totally believable here same goes for brad pitt totally believable as far as the supporting cast you wont recognize many but they do their jobs wellone cautionary note this is a complicated plot and one you have to pay close attention to or youll miss a lot so put the newspaper down and concentrate on the story youll be glad you did,intelligence
this tale has robert redford as a soon to retire cia agent who must defy his superiors and stage a daring rescue of his former protg brad pitt who spends most of the film getting tortured in his prison cell really this is redfords show and he proves that he still has the charisma to carry a film on his aging shoulders the storyline is somewhat predictable but the ways that redford outsmarts his cia handlers is still entertaining robert redford and brad pitt are well cast and work well together even though they seem quite out of place in the 1975 sequence in flashback redford looks far too old and pitt would have been only 12 at the time i really appreciate the way that the story was told in flashback as it slows the pace down while drawing you much deeper into the plot is sure to go down as a classic modern thriller great study piece for the workings of the cia and the compromises they do with the devil for the greater good a good case in point at how people working there are at the mercy of the top cia insiders if you like these subject matters this movie is for you not really into this stuff then if you are a big fan of these hunks redford and pitt you will be satisfied toomy rating 710,intelligence
i cant see why some people find boring it is one of the most exciting movies i have ever seen  keeps you thrilled from beginning to end and at the same time its one of the funniest my whole family adores redfords nathan muir and his dry humor such as every time my coach told me that i knew i was about to get benchedof course some scenes in the movie can be frightening for someone  shootings bombings and so on but they are not too graphic so i think for people who like actioncrimespy movies it is all just finethe setting of action in several completely different countries adds a lot of color and brightness to the movieand last but not least there is the romance of tom and elizabeth although for a major part of the movie it is in the background it always appears in time to remind the characters and also the watchers that there is more in this life than the cias cold rules and calculations,intelligence
because the plot is covered plenty of other reviewers  not sure from whence some reviewers including reliable old roger ebert acquired the notion that this movie covers 25 30 or 40 years muir meets bishop some months before the final us exodus from nam 1975 bishop leaves w that exodus present day is 1991 thats about 16 years maybe we should take into account that people aged more quickly in nam whether covert or no in any case whats really farfetched is bishop as a sniper from 1965 thru 1975therere also complaints about the superficial nature of the plot  the characters well theres a superficial nature to clandestine ops you ingratiate yourself into the bosom of your opposing number but unless youve developed suicidal ideations you dont make friends w him this is shown admirably in the case of the traitor schmidtthe movies style is a metaphor for the style of the people it portrays if your job is declaring your brethren expendable you are indeed shallow look the task force careers devoted to expediency wont soon extend serious consideration to moralitymuir may be smart but hes superficial too he views every phone call in terms of what itll produce 6 rounds hence all thats between him  bishop is the new yuppie establishment one suspects if the task force were composed of troy folger types muir wouldnt think twice about letting the chinese have their way w bishop but you have to be cold  calculating to betray your superiors while standing in their midstas an aside its genius casting when the protg is played by a guy pitt whose star quality is on par w where that of his mentors redford was 40 years ago a further irony harry duncan harrys a friend arent they all is played by now late david hemmings who cut his teeth playing dashing fashion photogs blow up  knights alfred the great back in that 60s era,intelligence
the pressing question which we can address first is what elevates this above your average espionage thriller the answer is twofold it isnt just about the plot where the backstory involves many angles and frame stories but also the game being played and the way it transpires something which is every bit as thrilling from a political perspective as it is physical this film is a real separation between the people who walk the walk and talk the talk in contrast with those who dont no doubt who winsin one of his definitive modern roles robert redfords playing of the corporate political game and the means by which his character nathan muir influences the state of play is the stand out in many ways i felt this acted as quite the satire on bureaucracy and corporate politics driven by muir who isnt your run of the mill administrator but a shrewd wily facilitator and occasionally cunning manipulator on one occasion muir tells someone in jest albeit with a poker face that the person has something in their teeth the vigour with which the person checks gives an idea of the mans powerful persuasive abilities but is also a reflection of the way he takes control of the game redford is so slick in how he carries this out that you are either chuckling at or left enamoured by his clevernessthe revolution around the mentorpupil relationship defines the film redford and brad pitt function so inadvertently and naturally well its all about them within the bigger picture and they are a flawless team arguably either a protagonist or deuteragonist depending on which way you look at it pitt takes on this role in a way that he is so dedicated and full of zeal for his craft but his conflicting morals and allegiance enhance both his credibility as a character and commendability for substantiating this into more than a shallow spy role muirs morals may waver but his loyalty and honour do not and that on the whole is one of the nicest aspects of this movie attaching a humanely side to stereotypically nameless faceless people without an identity who belong to an institution of political secrets not to mention adding in some enthralling side play along the way this probably does overstate the powers and capabilities of a man in such a high pressure highly strung environment but its entertaining nonetheless leaving aside the acceptable exaggeration this is as much about people as it is about countries groups and other larger demographics it certainly has a more individual touch than you would expect from a spy thriller and scripting which does not employ the usual suspects its a mix of action suspense politics and sly humour which progresses in a manner keeping you on the edge of your seat,intelligence
this movie will be liked by those who like thrillers sans gory actionsmaverick and his protg thats what i call robert redford and brad pittthey are so similar in their looks and mannerisms maybe brad looks more like bob in the moneyballbut here in little shadesnow coming to the story its a concoction of spys espionages misunderstandings and above all love and righteousness why love its what brad does to show his love for the heroine why righteousness its what bob does against all odds to jailout his protgthis movie has crispy and memorable dialogs nuances of cia games and very focused direction i think this is tony scotts best film to date  considering little action but more character understudy with a tightest plot fans of bob and brad are going to watch this movie more than few times like myself simply because its a superbly laid out story with twists and turns never leaving you off the hook i wonder why they cast catherine mccormack when there were so many better irishenglish actresses around she looks mummified and sick one thing which just sticks to you after watching the movie is the performance of robert redford who gives a collage of emotions during the course of his last day in his office bravo bob,intelligence
i am currently considering giving it a 75 or even higher because its apparently above the average as a politicalespionage thriller it stands firmly on the core of storyfriendship beyond politics and erathe highlight of the movie is not the action although the actions are tight and well edited over the two hours of viewing audiences will find mr redford most fascinating he is the real star here in my opinion he deserved to be nominated by the main stream awards he gave a performance very memorable multidimensional and with good character development brad pitt did his part ok although from time to time he doesnt really look like a soldier more alike a cowboy what really drags the film is the female lead catherine mccormack she doesnt feel comfortable in the whole picture at all and the romance between her and pitt was totally a farce since she looks a decade older than pitt not to mention her manly tough look every time when shes on the screen a lame tenor song plays to coordinate her existence thats really at odds with the entire film could they be deleted id give an 8as a chinese i also like to mention the portrait of china in the movie is not accurate first off the prisons would never be touched by foreigners be it international aid org or red cross or anything secondly su chou was not a coast city at all and chinese army would never allow their soldiers to have pet birds on duty for the negative portrait of the bureaus i can take that but all in all they need to do their homework to polish such detailstony scott is surely a master of thriller at the same time he may need to improve on certain criteria like casting more relevant film score etc,intelligence
a more or less by the numbers spy thriller saying that though by focusing the plot on robert redfords character the older wiser and soon to retire oldschool desk bound cia operative the film doesnt fall into the stereotypical actioncumspy thriller with pyrotechnics every couple of minutes or rooms full of spygeeks staring at screens showing the latest satellite intel to cover plot groundthe film demonstrates that good old fashioned cunning and guile plus knowing how the system works is still enough to ensure that the right thing gets done in this case the right thing is to try and ensure brad pitts character the younger cia field operative and refords protg is freed from a chinese prison instead of being left to the executioners in the name of political expediency from powerful people in suits high up in the us administration and ciathis is in a nutshellm the film  redfords must spend his last day at work fighting against the system and senior men in suits to try and get his errant protg pitt released from a foreign jailunfortunately the script and plotssubplots are never more than efficient albeit fairly obvious brad pitt hasnt too much to work with and again hes efficient with what he has the love interest in this film and ultimately the reason pitts character ends up in the chinese prison is really quite weak  theres no onscreen chemistry and it stretches ones credulity a bit much for something so crucial to the storyallinall worth a view in its favour the film doesnt fall into the crashbangwallop category of other films in this genre and therefore remains believable and induces a little empathy for the characters on the down side theres nothing new here from the actors or the story and its quietness and averageness will probably ensure youve forgotten youve even seen this film after a couple of weeks,intelligence

this was a memorable spy film with a good aboveaverageintelligence plot and plenty of style even though it was hollywooded up the film had a good sense of realism there were no missiles firing out of cars and metalcutting lasers that shoot out the side of a watchin this film the espionage and spyrelated activities were more subtle and accordingly much more realistic and intriguingaside from the good fundamentals the film had two stand out features that gave it the complete package feel the first was robert redford i am one of those filmgoers who bemoans the loss of magnificent acting talents and embraces good looking dead heads to mindlessly work their way through the script redford has a magnificent speaking voice a dramatic onscreen presence and controlled yet powerful tone that is almost nonexistent in the current upandcoming crop of popular actors but redford is from the old school where true acting talent was the first criterion upon which youd be hired to do a film probably the only stand out actoractress of the modern era with plenty of presence and power is hillary swankthe second thing that made this film special was the fact that the film seamlessly jumped between the past and present i love films where the characters are revisiting events of the past rather than a simply linear story it allows the filmmakers to highlight the essentials and leave out the boring connecting story linecracker and highly recommended viewing,intelligence

on the scene where they get caught who is the chinese dude that got out of the van and turned back and started walking that part totallyconfused me and made me think that that guy was toms friend back innam and that he was the prisoner and that he went back to save thatguy i never saw it was the girl until they brought it upahh this movie so confusingcan someone explain to me this whole movie lolhow is hadly muirs wife and in other threads how can bishop be muirs son he slept with hadly  so if hadly was his mom he slept with his mom,intelligence
cia espionage agent nathan muir robert redford on his last day before retirement learns that his protg tom bishop brad pitt has been taken prisoner by the chinese government and is about to be executed for spying while giving a report on bishop to agents unwilling to help muir attempts behind the scenes manuevers to helpthis appears to be a casually slick and superficial genre movie with enjoyable twists and turns in fact though its a wellfilmed and slick character piece the relationship between redford and pitt is the core of the movie pitt is sometimes a marvelous actor and sometimes a dreadful one but the roll of the dice favored him in and he is incredibly solid and watchable meanwhile its also a spy movie about spying and about spy movies more than it is a particular espionage piece this sounds thoughtful and introspective but it isnt is another stupid action movie but with a soul,intelligence
this is probably one of the best spy movies ive ever seenunlike the charmingwham bam thank you mam spies weve seen in bond and other gadget brandishing spiesmuirredford shows us how attentiveintelligent and observant spies areand gives me a whole newand outlook on the worktraining of these individualshis taking of bishoppitt under his winghis trainingand his arrangement of the whole operation dinner outwas way too coolredford delivered a character whose intelligence you cant help but admirethe wayhe captured thingspicked up informationand got people to tell him what he wantedthumbs up to this movie,intelligence
this film has a strong script and a great narrative feelas the perfectly cast redford pits his wits against the cia and other obstacles you learn what drives him and the people around him and the history that binds them each retrospective episode works as a mini film in itself and there are some really surprising performances  notably the doctor who eventually gets involved in the war that redford and pitt are involved in it is a tragic yet inevitable moment and brings you into contact with all the peripheral casualties that a war includeson the negative side tony scott experiments with some glitzy and irritating camera techniques vfast pans swoops zooms which add nothing to my mind if it were a boring film then maybe it would make it seem less so but spygame really doesnt need thisthe music can also at times be embarrassingly corny there is a aled jones type choir peace that accompanies one particular theme repeatedly and simplifies the situation to a good v evil theme when you are aware of all the numerous shades of grey in any situation like this as shown in the film so well this seems inappropriateconclusion a great film complex great characterisation all actors earn their money you need to concentrate on it though as there is a lot of detail and if you miss any of it it could get confusing,intelligence
concerns the endeavors of nathan muir redford in trying to free his protege tom bishop pitt whos gone off to find the woman he loved as shes stuck in a chinese jail about 13 of the movies events take place in 1991 with muir trying to outfox his cia superiors throughout the course of two days before his retirement from the agency and trick the nearest military camp into liberating bishop and his woman much of the picture takes place in flashbacks and thats obviously the more interesting offering the passage of time is discernible through pitts changing haircuts and a pretty enthralling set piece in beirut essentially caps the film even if theres actually still 20 minutes left before its over this is a solid underrated and imperfect piece of movie its got a lot of visual panache emulating different atmospheres and tensions for different settings  the sleek streamlined dc offices of the agency the smoky deteriorating cities of germany gritty wartorn beirut etc tony scotts always been underrated for his skill at combining visual ideas with tones or less glowingly switching the two the script moves like clockwork with the characters throwing lines  some clichd some not  at each other snappily and cheerfully and emoting when necessary everybody appears to have taken the project seriously enough but nobody was trying to win an oscar for it either the music is effective and dramatic and at times poundingly good but this goes back to the combination of visuals the characters are likeable and instantly involving but this is only thanks to the two lead actors in anyone elses hands i should think it would be hard to care about bishop or muir quite like we do albeit disposably in this moviethe trouble is theres not enough mindless action  its too smart  to make this an all out bloodbath and too little character development and truly remarkable writing to make it a big piece of art  or a riveting drama everyone does a great job but its not truly memorable for its pathos nor does it try to be this doesnt make it a tedious movie or anything but it doesnt help the generally talky story along for audience members whore convinced theyve seen it all before scott knows how to make some papers shuffled into an envelope exciting but after an hour and a half i found myself aching for the inevitable explosion when there is action its performed with a kind of chipper proficiency the cast and filmmakers real relish here appears to be with the characters and story which as a sidenote is mildly informative but whats the anchor here theres barely enough chutzpah in the dialogue  aesthetics to keep it interesting but never spectacular still hats remain off to scott and company for cutting it as close as possible,intelligence
this film was boring it played out well but it was hardly a spy film i was expecting it to be full of espionage and action but it wasnt brad pitt is a young cia spy who is kidnapped at the beginning of the film during a spy mission in china and his longtime boss robert redford has 24 hours to save him before he is executed in the chinese prison the whole film redford sits in an office and nearly every scene in the film is a flashback detailing how pitt and redford met and some of the very dull missions that pitt went on there was no spying in the film so i do not know why it was titled pitt is a spy but he doesnt really act like one there is not a single scene of action throughout the film so if you want to see an action movie rent something else feel free to email me with any questions or comments,intelligence
this movie should be interesting when you consider the leads are played by such great actors as redford and pitt but the result is rather disappointing and quite tediousciaagent pitt is captured during some rescue attempt mission in china in the opening scene of the film and you expect the remainder of the movie to be focused on his old mentor redford trying to get him out of this capture however what you get is a very long series of flashback episodes featuring pitt and redfords previous experiences ranging from vietnam to berlin combined with ciameetings where redford tries to rescue his protege from being sacrificed as a victim of international politics the rescue mission itself lasts about 45 seconds and is completely devoid of any action of interest so the film to me never really kicks off you have to be on some seriously strong stimulants not to fall asleep during the beirut scenesthe movie is in other words like a long flashback episode which never really reaches a climax,intelligence
i went to see this movie with my boyfriend at the dollar movie theater i didnt want to see it and didnt think it would be very good  it turns out that it was way worse than i thought it would be  i was so bored watching whatever was going on with the plot i cant even remember thats how boring it was that i was longing to go out in the lobby and balance my checkbook but i was hoping maybe it would get better  it didnt though it just made me want to go to sleep  i mean maybe some people would enjoy watching a bunch of old white guys sitting around a conference room arguing for two hours but i am not one of them  one of the worst movies i have ever seen redford and pitt should have known better,intelligence
if only the word camp were solely synonymous with a good time in the outdoors rather than as an apt description for this schlock  this played out much like new years eve    its all great fun until the end  when the film ended in a vicious hangover of cliche  the farther it went along the further it drifted from any grasp of reality  and what was the girlfriend doing in a male prison anyhow  gimme a break  my only consolation is that it was 3 for 2 night at blockbuster and one of our choices was gosford park  never thought id admit this being the patriot that i am but when it comes to filmmaking the british have it all over us   opening body and closure  perhaps this importance of a good end should be hammered home to american film students they certainly could use it,intelligence
ok ill give credit where its due occasionally redford gives us a film not only intelligent but also gasp entertaining  this however is not such a film sneakers which was wrongfully ignored butch cassidy the sting the electric horseman and the last castle are among his entertaining yet still quality films although this film may depict the reallife goings on of the spy world for those of us who since 1962 have been treated to a very different type of spy and this bye the way covers most if not all of the moviegoing public when we see spy we expect a solid story yes but with action and intrigue this film for the most part had all the event and suspense of a bill clinton speech blechh,intelligence
contains some minor spoilersi saw this movie last night on payperview satellite tv i paid 350 us5 for it but fell asleep towards the end as it was just rather boringis slick and fairly well made the performances particularly redfords are good but the general lack of a sense of direction in the film make it rather hard to watch the premise of the film is expressed rather too subtly in my opinion its clear that pitts character is acting covertly and attempting to rescue someone in the movies opening sequence but from then on i found myself asking questions of what exactly was going on in the filmthere is some interesting camerawork in the film showing beirut rooftops and hong kong skyscrapers in a mix of slow and fastmotion and while this all looks nice its hard to take it as anything more than eye candythe relationship between pitt and redford in the flashback scenes develops ok but pitts love interest on which the entire plot of the film rests is so utterly underdeveloped that its almost impossible to understand how his character would get himself in such a pickle over the girl in questionalthough i dont like to get bogged down in the technicalities of a plot makeup etc in this instance i really must for starters we see pitt being contacted by redford in 1975 when pitt is a sniper fighting in vietnam the main plot is set in 1991 some 16 years later while im aware that no film maker can reverse the aging process i dont think its too much to ask for some decent make up and hair work to at least help the illusion along redfords hair never changes in style or color throughout the movie apart from some little sideburns at one point and pitt is far too young to be playing someone old enough to have been a trained sharp shooter some 16 years earlier little nags like these i had a similar problem with red dragon make suspension of disbelief all the more difficultall in all this movie is slick and subtle often too subtle the acting is good the direction mediocre the settings are recreated excellently and theres none of the overthetop hardtobelieve bull thats all too familiar in hollywood spybased movies that said is really just rather boring nothing really happens for almost an hour and the make up and hair team could have at least turned up for work for the flashback scenesoverall worth seeing if you really like spy movies otherwise youre not missing anything special55 out of 10,intelligence
the best thing about this movie was the editing and camera style i liked how the camera would pan around the characters in some scenes i did have a problem with robert redfords age he looked just as old during the vietnam scenes as he did in the 1991 scenes  and brad pitt didnt really look much younger in the nam scenes either  as for the plot i dont really believe that someone could just forge a secret mission like that and have it carried out in an hour  wouldnt it have taken that wiley guy time to prepare a team to go into the prison  but if you look past that the movie is pretty good  i did like the beginning when brad pitt tries to rescue the girl from the prison  that was a good planfinal verdict  brad pitt is as cute as always so worth watching just for him  not a lot of action but i found it to be entertaining,intelligence
includes possible spoilerson his last day with the cia an agent played by robert redford becomes embroiled in an international incident involving a spy named bishop for some reason always an unlucky name in movies who he trained years agoover the years i do think redford has shown himself to be a very poor albeit lucky spy youd think hed lie in wait for the baddies or at least learn to keep his important files in a safe deposit box or booby trap his office i mean in 3 days of the condor they ransack his office steal files and kill his associates in sneakers they do it again at least in they dont kill anyone when they ransack his officeof course there is a lot of fantasy in this take on the cia we all know the cia doesnt have all its internal phones bugged or know unimportant details about its long time agents  like whether or not theyre married and to whom nah they wouldnt know about that stuff as usual anyone carrying an ak cant hit the broadside of a barn or two guys in the open on top of a hill from a helicopter  or a car in the middle of a street from an overlooking building etcon the whole the film is a pretty good thriller of the storytoldinflashback style the story is both a genre picture and a commentary on the business of spying not dissimilar to the disenfranchised cold war hitchcockian movies of the french new wave though never really elevates much beyond the level of solid genre filmwhile both redford and pitt turn in fine performances the thrills never reach the heights of others of its type check out the 80s remake of the big clock called no way out for a more thrilling take on washington intrigue all in all is enjoyable but nothing more,intelligence
im not going to say that is the worst movie ive ever seen but its without doubt the most boring one very little action no suspense no drama and bad acting from robert redford his younger coactor brad pitt doesnt have to act great to be 100 times better than the too old robert redford please do yourself and other moviefanatics a pleasure and put another filmbox in front of this one this one is pure waste of time,intelligence
possible spoilersi dont want to offend anyone but there are alot of logical problems with this film to make it even impossible to watch how the hell did they get brad out of the hong kong prison they totally disabled the whole electrical power of hong kong prison this is the great minds of the american directing at work here having been living in hong kong for many years now i can relate to those people complaining about american war films they never research the place that they are going to film on that is not the hk i knew it must be some other country that they dreamt up and decided to put in the film why dont they use actual hong kong actors from hk no of course not that would be too logical they will of course use asians that are from other countries that speak strange cantonese accent to play the part and what do they show of the hk prison it looked like a third world corrupted country that can beat up anyone i know that this is not supposed to be taken too seriously but come on folks this is alittle silly it is also alittle insulting both to the viewers and also to other countries we are not that stupid,intelligence
the is a clever thriller that has some excellent dialogue and verbal sparring but for me  lacks the action that would have made this a great film brad pitt and robert redford is as good a line up as you could hope for and neither make bad films but it is a shame that we dont see both in to many scenes together if i had to pick the better of the two in this movie it would redford his battle  verbaly  with his superiors is the highlight of the film  it is a little far fetched too  especially the ending and without going into what happens  it is a bit of a cop out all in all the film is very watchable and enjoyable but you come away with feeling that it lacks a certain something 7 out of 10,intelligence
because i think robert redford relies so much more on charm than on any substantial acting talent even brad pitt makes him look bad one of the best things about this ludicrous escape yarn though is the reality of the scenes in west beirut circa 1985 the poverty and violent chaos ring true one can only imagine as a precursor of the cult of suicide that made the attacks of september 11 possible chilling and worth the price of admission now as for the depiction of a clandestine us assault on communist china wellshut your eyes or your brain on that little detail,intelligence
i went to the cinema last night having no idea what to watch knowing with deafening certainty i was not going to wander into any of the harry potter screenings after deciding against zoolander i opted to go and see i certainly enjoyed enemy of the state  even for a film with will smith in it however as opened i knew this was a different league altogether for a start it is much darker  there are lots of interiors of prisons dank german cafes and bosnian streets  the plot is a lot less fantasical and before i go any further  the soundtrack was stunning it alternated between high octane guitars and electronic beats to quiet piano moments to huge orchestral expanses this really helped the atmosphere of the film especially in the bosnian scenes if you are looking for an alternative to harry potter before lotr comes out i cannot reccomend this strongly enough robert redford is very good as the cia agent about to retire and equally brad pitt as the rebellious agent who works for redford if i have one criticism of the film and i think that it is important to have  it is that you cannot take your concentration off the action for one second i dropped some popcorn uttered where has that gone and returned to my viewing to find i had to retrack to find out what was going onbut it is this fast pace of events which ensure you dont realise it runs for over two hours i know it is a false hope but this film deserves so much more attention that harry potter,intelligence
i went in thinking it would be ok not necessarily expecting all that much i should have remembered how great brad pitt was in snatch and fight club he did an incredible job in this movie as did robert redford  the plot twists and turns throughout and its just an amazing movie  if you havent seen it yet youre missing out,intelligence
a good old fashioned corridors of power with backstabbing and coniving thrillerspy movie tony scott has realy matured and while older brother is moving more toward action movies gladiator black hawk down tony seems to be moving away succesfully i might addmay even forgive my favourite director for the fan at this rate,intelligence
this movie hums right along with truly authentic atmospheres and settings director tony scott brother of another famous director ridley scott uses some of the camera techniques that he first showed us in enemy of the state  flawless acting from cinema great robert redford scoots the storyline right along with zeal and interest  brad pitt who obviously came into his own as a serious actor before this movie has sharpened his skills in this film  the multiple talents brought to this movie make it a very worthwhile cinematic experience,intelligence
is one of those rare movies that is even better than id hoped for i went in expecting a solid 7 grade movie and walked away wondering if it just didnt justify a 9 rating  it is one of those rare movies that really never drags  not at any point during the film did i find my mind wandering elsewhere  immediately upon leaving the theater afterwards i decided that this is definitely one worth seeing at the box office again  robert redford comes out of seclusion every couple of years to do a few movies almost as if to remind everyone that hes still around  his recent efforts including the last castle had not in my opinion been anything to write home about this one is  brad pitt does an excellent job as well  i hope that he will take more roles such as this in the future and leave movies like the mexican to lesser lights  the only problems i had with this movie are a pair of anachronisms that would be apparent only to a select few  firstly brad pitt wears a san diego padres hat during the film in the lebanon segment that was set in 1985  the padres hat he wears is a modern one not the one worn by the team back in 85  clips from baywatch are shown including baywatch icon pamela anderson  this was set in 1991  anderson wasnt on the show until 1992  these are silly i realize and i doubt too many other viewers of this movie would either recognize them or care in the least but i noticed them and just wondered if anyone else had,intelligence
i loved this movie it wasnt the action flick that i originally went to the movie theatre looking to see but it was still great robert redford and brad pitts acting was perfect there were funny lines that fit in perfectly there was the perfect amount of suspense etc if you like spy movies see i give it 1010,intelligence
contains spoiler i went in as a bob and brad fan  i came out appreciating them even more these are two fine actors that bring real emotion and compassion to their characters  yes this is a film that weve all seen before seasoned vet on his last day saving the rookie  but redford is mesmorizing throughout and pitt brings a confidence bravado and ease to the role that make it work the mentormentee relationship is clear  and i have to say pitt bloodied beyond recognition and without saying a word brought tears to my eyes in the final sequence with his quiet recognition of redfords compassion and validation of their relationship,intelligence
this was one of the best movies ive seen in a long time  the balance and cycle between drama and action was excellent  given the number of changes between drama and action sequences and the framework through which it was presented the flow of the movie was remarkable  it was well acted the sound track was good and the story was compelling  both main characters were likable and most importantly believable  i liked that fact that the heroes were not always very heroic  they were very human experiencing moments of doubt conflict and weakness  i havent completed my cia operative training yet but i think most of the tactics and stragies employed by the main characters are probably true to life  i rated this movie as a 9 out of 10  there is very little to criticize about this movie one weakness i see is the opening another weakness would be the doctors development  i think they missed a good opportunity to show how someone could be manipulated  youll have to see the movie to find out what i mean go and see it now,intelligence
ok there was nothing inherently wrong with this picture  it had all tony scotts trademarks rich visual style dazzling cinematography and beautiful production designs making it very pretty to look at it also has two big stars in it who are good actors even if pitt seems to be in autopilot for this one it even had catherine mccormack in it as some reasonably good eye candyhowever it doesnt really rise above the average runofthemillpostcoldwarinternationalespionageblowingupthingsall overtheworldanddoingcleverthingswithgadgets its even got the stereotypical old spy saying we used to be able to tell who the good guys and the bad guys were although scott never allows it to get corny or unrealistic you still get the feeling that its just a glorified bond film thats given a bit more thought to its set piecesin a few years time this film will be largely forgotten youll be having a chat with your mates in the pub yeah what was that film called something to do with spies it had brad pitt and that old guy with the face that had more lines than a detention class yeah what was that film calledbeing an average film ive given it a very average 5 out of 10,intelligence
is a superior espionage film that succeeds because of its two leads brad pitt and robert redford  pitt gives a great performance but the star here is redford in his best performance in a while  the plot is great full of exciting happenings twists and sly dialogue  still the two leads are the reason the movie works  i saw it at a theater and i plan on buying or renting it a soon as it is out on video,intelligence
i was pleasantly surprised by this movie  it is intelligent exciting and beautifully shot the teaming of tony scott dan mindel dop and christian wagner editor creates a look that is quite similar to enemy of the state both leading men are great although stephen dillane does his best to steal the limelight i would recommend this movie  it is a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours,intelligence
everything id hoped for in a movie if you like conspiracy movies that dont suffer from weak plots and actors like big willy in this is for you has a bit of everything from conspiracy to blackops missions  totally immersive without being overly political also outstanding performances from robert redford and brad pitt well worth the cash to see this gem,intelligence
i had high expectations for this film and i was not let down  it is an extremely stylish film due mostly to tony scotts hyperkinetic direction the plot is half decient and the action sequences are well staged there are also lots of behind the scenes stuff about how the cia works that i found quite interesting  a great film,intelligence
it was very nice to see a tony scott film that was free from the oppression of jerry bruckheimer i was glad to see a movie about the grey areas of spying and about the us involvement via the cia abroad in the 70s and 80s what i like is that there are no clear lines and unlike a jerry bruckheimer produced film it wasnt bombarded with american flags and mindless patriotism it was a very insightful look into the ways and means of two fictional spies robert redford and brad pitt to accomplish various missions over a 15 year period dealing with both politics of the agency and emotional ties with assets i really like how they showed that spying isnt as james bond as most people think simple things like a piece of gum can be the difference between life and death and tools like cigarettes are much more effective than carrying a gun although some of the scenes of terrorism were very graphic and horrific i think it is important that we see what is really behind these terrible common occurrences in other countries if top gun is what you are looking for in a war movie dont see because it is a very different and much better look at goes down because the cia finds it in its best interest910,intelligence
this is one great ride  tony scott delivers as always with this stylish cia thriller  a fantastic script combined with two great performances from pitt and redford make for great tension and constant watchability  scott delivers his usual craftsmanship combining excellent cinematography with dazzling visual flare  great editing and a really good score as well by harry gregsonwilliams  im a huge tscott fan and this is another fine addition to his collection  im just waiting for the day when he makes his masterpiece or his second masterpiececrimson tide being the first of course  i recommend this film to anyone who loves a really good time at an action movie without having to leave your brain at the door  my rating 93,intelligence
this movie is really great  i am a big fan of both robert redford and especially brad pitt the movie has a great story line and the acting is very solid brad pitt is at his best if you have seen 12 monkeys seven and a river runs through it you will understand what i mean by this comment the movie held my attention all the way with great photography action and story line some people say the flash backs were too much but i didnt have a problem with any part of this film  i really enjoyed it i would have to say that it is one of the best movies i have seen this year go see it  it is movie making and movie acting at its best,intelligence
without retelling the story just a few comments about the general quality of the movie excellent story a few implausible situations but that is to be expected from an action movie the makeup department could have done a better job with redford in the flashback sequences redford and pitt gave strong performances although i would have liked to see brad pitt do more i think it could have worked to enhance the movie and could have been accomplished in five to ten effectively developed minutesthis is a very very good movie on most levels photography musical score plot development editing and acting were all well above average one of the very best adult oriented films of the year definitely a 910,intelligence
this movie was boring and ran way too long  and whats with the cheesy techno music throughout the entire film  i like both these actors but certainly not in this movie  the movie runs over 2 hours at which point my friends and i were struggling to stay awake  the movie is predictable and robert redford has just gotten too old by the way did i mention the constant techno music in the background cause it sucks,intelligence
i went into this movie thinking it would be the typical spy movie with boring concepts and unbelievable situations however as is typical from redford and pitt it surpassed my expectations completely these two actors have an incredible amount of onscreen chemistry couple that with michael manns crisp and fresh style of shooting and directing and youll see that is a fun and clever spy movie that doesnt rely solely on ridiculous situations it works because the mentorstudent relationship is lifelike and thus the tricks and turns make sense and are enjoyable see this movie,intelligence
star ratingunmissablevery goodokayyou could go out for a meal insteadavoid at all costs having already directed him in the 1992 flick a river runs through itaging leading man robert redford stars alongside brad pitt in tony scotts new action thrillerit has poor character developmentnot the most structured or engaging of storys and it does have longboring partshowevertheres a very nice freneticalfastpaced feel in parts which makes it worth watching,intelligence
if you havent seen this movie yet then get off your butts and go see it im only 13 and i thought that this was a great movie when i first went to see it i was only seeing it cuz my mom wanted to watch it and im happy that she chose this movie cuz i really enjoyed it too,intelligence
this was a great movie  it was very refreshing to see an intelligent wellmade movie especially considering some of the other films that are out  this is a very dense story with many characters and plottwists so make sure you are ready to pay attention and go see this in a good theater,intelligence
tony scott never ceases to bore me  television commercials done up as feature films with over the top soundtracks and wonder bread casts  this film is still all of those things but it actually has some substance in there somewhere  the acting is fine its typically shot technically slick and not a bad story  somewhere though there is a lack of respect for the audience and an inability to really tell a story without hammering people over the head with everythinglittle tony is growing up  sort of  its a good rental for a cold winter night but save your money and miss it in the theater  while the press goes on about how the public needs this sort of crap to feed some false patriotism in the end it is only a mildly entertaining spy movie which fails to satisfy  its cotton candy for grownups,intelligence
this movie was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time  as always brad pitt is absolutely amazing  he is an amazing actor  robert redford does a good job also  he reminds me of kevin spacey in usual suspects everyone should see this movie it is truly amazing  it is rated r but that was only for minor language problems and some situational violence  i recommend it to people interested in intense espionage related films,intelligence
my wife and i went into this film thinking that it would be good  we both like good spy and suspense movies and thought this film would be a good diversion  we were wrong  this film was excellent  we were on the edge of our seats the whole time and the middle east sequence was so intense that one might need a prevacid to endure it  both robert and brad turned in over the top performances and tony scotts direction was brilliant  i find it incredible that two excellent directors tony and ridley are brothers the cohen brothers are good but they always work together  this film is a must see for anyone who loves the spy film genre or the actors and director i give it 5 stars out of 5,intelligence
the trailer for the movie expected me to see the standard american movie formula namely the typical shootem up blow em up waste of money that you usually see these days  well except for the ending which i found to be totally implausible i was engaged and thinking albeit not that hard throughout the movie which these days should be considered a victory  i thought the timing particularly after september 11th to help my appreciation of the film that there are enemies of the state out there and that there probably are covert actions and double dealing of the type that is dealt with here although i suspect that most of the activity that happened to redford and pitt throughout the movie may have been experienced by a whole cadre of agents  redford in particular i thought was effective as  the jaded cynical old fox who brings all his skills to bear to help out his protege  the whole substory about beirut was very well done you almost felt like you were there and the suicide bombings really hit home hard  i spent a precious ten minutes figuring out where id seen pitts girlfriend from shes mel gibsons first lover in braveheart very good here i thought for a small role  all in all you could do worse than plunk down gasp 1290 here in canada to watch it on the big screen,intelligence
is a movie that takes a roundabout way to get to the point  the story is simple  robert redford on the day before retiring from the cia must try to save brad pitt his protg from being executed for espionage by the chinese authorities  redford has 24 hours to talk and connive his way around senior cia officials who are willing to sacrifice pitt for the good of trade talks  the film is mostly told in flashbacks  we see flashbacks of redford convincing pitt to join the cia  we see pitt on his first assignment  we see pitt on the assignment that lead to this incident in between we see redford in an intense meeting with the clock ticking not all of what were seeing is related to the story at hand but like a trail its testimony to the relationship between redford and pitt and pitts own work ethic if you can use the word ethic when referring to the cia  for that reason you sometimes wish theyd just get on with it remember though we are entering the christmas season where movies are all about length and character development because the academy likes bothredford does a marvelous job  you get the sense that his character is reveling in this final challenge the day before retiring  he conducts himself with a surefire cockiness and a knowing smirk that gives him the upper hand  you sense he is going to miss the business a great deal pitt on the other hand does his darnedest  it just isnt always enough  as an actor he lacks the intensity of peers like sean penn or edward norton  he just cant find the right note like he did so brilliantly in fight club a role much more suited to his surferdudecumactor demeanor  pitt even sabotages one scene by turning to the camera and making a silly bored faceorchestrating all of this is director tony top gun enemy of the state scott  and i use the word orchestrating literally  scott uses gels and color lens filters quite liberally to create mood and ambience  he employs snazzy camera movements and freezeframes that are reminiscent of the 60s cinema  scott stages violence like other directors would stage a wagnerian opera  the shot of a hotel in beirut exploding is stunning  the camera slows down just a little to give you the full effect of the destruction while the music swells over the sound of the explosionsometimes movies are exercises in style over substance and is just such a movie  see it for the artistry of redfords performance and scotts direction  as for the substance youll be disappointed that all of these characters and resources were used for an absolutely frivolous mission,intelligence
holywood action thriller yet tinged with intelligence that takes this movie to the next levelvery good production that screams for more depth and better makeup to turn into a masterpiecebut stillthis movie is a classic action thriller for suregreat study piece for the workings of the cia and the compromises they do with the devil for the greater gooda good case in point at how we are at the mercy of the top cia insidersif you like these subject mattersthis movie is for younot really into this stuffthen if you are a big fan of these hunks redford and pittyou will be satisfied tooredford is a little on the grey side but still plays coolsexy well and holds his own with pittmajor flaw is when they hardly age during the 19751985 flashback sequencesthey must have known make up does wonders since the 90s,intelligence
it seems nowadays that for a movie to be successful it has to have a complicated plot be overdirected and be completely brainless well has two out of three   the movie isnt totally brainless but if you think to much about it youll realize the plot had more holes than a swiss cheese factory some interesting action sequences and a gripping storyline made the film watchable and fairly entertaining  but the direction was a subtle as a punch in the face i think this is one of those films that needs to be dehollywoodized if you know what i mean,intelligence
the best i can say about this movie is that it might be a good antidote for tvs alias in the training the setting up the eventual execution of plans take forever  everyone good guys and bad guys alike looks painfully dubious about the effectiveness andor the morality of actions contemplated  after 30 seconds of this each one just falls in line and does what he was considering in the first place  there is so much mystery about who is on whose side and what the relations are and for what some terrorist is almost accidentally blown up and the a couple of semicompetent agents have to be sprung from prison  everything in the movie points to big deal while the viewer keeps wondering who these people are what are they doing that matters and why should we carei cant help compare this redford movie with the last castle where scenes are so quietly underplayed as everyday occurrences but the issues of leadership loyalty and competence are brought out thoughtfully and forcefully,intelligence
the form of this film would be much more successful as a novel than as a narrative motion picture we dont need the edgy guitar riffs during the training sequence we dont need the hyperspeed transition cuts we dont need to be told what time it is what we do need is a little more suspense and intrigue give the viewer a little credit when you have a story that is smarter than the average viewer only then do you have to start worrying about losing people the flashbacks were too long and served little purpose the riskiest action undertaken by the protagonist in this thriller is hiding some files and sneaking off to use a coworkers phone that isnt going to cut it nice porsche 912 though,intelligence
i just finished watching on video and i throughly enjoyed iti wished i hadnt missed the opportunity to see it in the cinema it would have been great on the big screenyou dont see many realistic movies nowadays in the spy genre but this was one of themi love the way it was shot and it had cool action sequencesrobert redford was terrific in his role and of course brad pitt was great as usuali would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a raw spy thriller,intelligence
 definite spoiler potential below  im not exactly sure why this movie has achieved such a good ratingthis film is slow cliche and there are points that are so tediously dull that it makes me want to watch the mcneil lehrer report as an alternativehoweverthe acting is top notch from pitt  redford plays his generic character well the topothefoodchain guy that he played in his last ten movies redford is pokerfaced rough and cares not about humanity  his character is underdeveloped perhaps we are just to assume we know the parts he plays by now but he gets across what i believe is the point of this soontoberetired cia agentthe story as a whole is moderately interesting but becomes quite ridiculous as you watch a cia lifer constantly subvert his own organization complete with forging documents and obtaining classified information lying and doing a lot of stupid things  dont get me wrong im not against bucking the system but the problem with this idea is that redford is obviously willing to kill others to accomplish a mission or op yet when the cia has a motive to let brad pitt go redford decides thats not right  seems not going with the character that was painfully created over almost two hours before anything interesting happenedthis movie as a whole was not nearly as good as people made it out to be hopefully everyone will review this movie appropriately and bring it down to about a 5 which is what it deserves,intelligence
the film began very promising but then i had to wait two long hours till something important happened director tony scott tried to create some action moments on international places but i think it didnt work the story between was boring and only the last five minutes this movie got really alive soundtrack and filmcolor was not the best i gave only 510,intelligence
i consider top gun to be be one of the topnotch movies of the 80s and a modern classic i have lost count of times that i have watched it and every single time i have felt a jolt and and rush this is why every time i have watched a tony scott directed movie i have always found myself pulling my hair as to how director of top gun make such horrible and mindless movies how could he trick robert deniro one of the greatest actors of all time to do a horrible flick like the fan how could he blatantly try to repeat the formula for top gun in days of thunder every time i watched tony scott movies i vowed not to watch them againso i feel lucky that i didnt know was tony scott movie i only got it cause of redford and pitt when the movie began and tony scotts name came up i had already given up when the plot didnt seem to go anywhere for a quiet a while i told myself thats a lesson for me for not checking who the director was then something amazing happened the movie started to look cool something in the movie started pulling me towards it something started to make me care for the fate of lead character played by brad pitt then it got even better once we are told why hero is where he is one has no choice but to view the whole movie and every character in it in a whole new light all of a sudden it becomes a powerful beautiful gripping romantic epicthe gradual and then a sudden transformation of characters is what grabbed my interest and one goes from not really caring to not being able to relax the most amazing quality of the movie is that its a twentyfour hour thriller and yet one is introduced to the entire career of lead character this leaves one with the feeling of watching an epic like benhur at the pace of diehard its totally contradicting and unique feelingthe photography is just exceptional the locations the sets are totally convincing the acting by all the characters is just awesome the screenplay is great not a single dialogue is wasted the whole atmosphere is just totally cool the ending is perfecti forgive tony scott for tormenting us with his work since top gun maybe it wasnt his fault at all and it was that jackass jerry buckheimer who was the producer on most of those projects and whose influence effected the talents and performance of tony scott hope he manages to stay away from buckheimer in future this movie is not just a good movie but a great movie it is amazingly powerful movie as it grabs you and moves you its going to be part of my collection soon,intelligence
outside of some stupid cliches and predictable oneliners with references to of course body parts and sex an ok movielots of action robert redfords always wonderful to watch sometimes movie seems to try too much its camera shots and editing effects,intelligence
that was mean   courage under fire sucked so much that i shouldnt compare it to this decency  brad pitt tried to play a perfect tom cruise character in this film while robert redford was obviously a replacement for gene hackman  other than that and the horribly boring flashbacks of pitt it was worth my 750  redford did a nice job of being the lovable lawbreaking type of good guy while pitt was the disobedient romantic good guy  all the bad guys were following their orders and trying to improve the usa  this movie is just a representation of rebellion to me but it was very entertaining,intelligence
we have not enjoyed a spy movie this much in years  dont get me wrong i love james bond and austin powers for vastly different reasons but truly intelligent espionage movies are few and far between  this is a movie you dont leave to get popcorn or drinks  the writing is wonderful  the story is tightly woven and a seamless combination of dialogue and visual storytelling  the acting is right on targetif you like espionage movies or just appreciate great writing dont miss this movie,intelligence
this movie was soooo horrible when i went to see this movie on dvd at my girlfriends house i thought it was going to be a good movie loaded with lots of action it was not  the movie drags on for about an hour and 40 minutes even my girlfriend couldnt maintain her boredom and it became clear that she was bored when she exclaimed wheres the action it wasnt until the last 1520 min that there was action  i did not even stick around to see the last two scenes so for all of you people who like calm autobiographical movies enjoy if youre an action guru like myself than this movie is not for you,intelligence
very strong play by robert redford in his way as an rebelling intelligence recruiter protecting his protege brad pitt however the highlight is to much on brad pitt its the way how redford tells the story which keeps you watching this movie how he deceives his commanding officers and tells lies while he feels the warm breath of capture in his neck in conclusion robert redford makes the movie but still it isnt a movie worthwhile watching therefore the spotlights are to much aimed at brad pitt,intelligence
left a rather bitter and confused taste in my mouth after its viewing as i had no idea what the film was attempting to do were we to feel a sanitised comradery for brad pitts distant character tom bishop were we to chuckle inwardly at nathan muirs played by robert redford ingenious attempts to thwart his cia superiors or were we simply supposed to be glad that we endured this film in airconditioned comfort though the plot generally was able to drag itself above the unoriginal thrillers that have been bombarding cinemagoers it tried too hard in its desperation the annoying subplots over used subplots and bland characters just left me thinking why o why didnt robert redford moisturise try harderrating 410,intelligence
this was a very entertaining film and both leads but particularly redford do a great jobyou dont want to look too closely at some of the plot points but the whole thing flows very wellone minor technical pointwhat is brad pitt us military doing with a303 enfield british wwii sniper rifle in 1975 viet nam and where does he get ammo for it it must have been what was available in the prop department after all whos going to notice,intelligence
this movie didnt even try to avoid obvious cliches retiring cia who wants to do good one more time a system that is too busy trying to obey its own rules to be bothered trying to live up to its mission a rebel get the job done agent that can barely be controlled yet is allowed to continue in the job if they were cops instead of cia it could have been an episode of starsky and hutchthe same stoppanstop camera work that made me want to put out of sight out of my mind plagued this movie as well also a problem was the fact that the movie was constantly jumping in time without much warning though not nearly as badly as out of sight it wasnt impossible to keep track of just more trouble than it was ultimately worthmission to mars is my touch stone for bad movies is probably 25 as bad as mission to mars if its the only movie playing during the time you have available maybe you should just walk around the mall insteaddave,intelligence
deserves more credit and attention but it likely will not receive it because smart sweeping thrillers like this usually go right over the heads of the american public its taut beautifully crafted produced edited and acted this is a classic spy thriller and it makes behind enemy lines look even more whitetrashy and pretentious than it already is its my best film of the year everything tony scott touches is gold this is the craft of filmmaking at its best,intelligence
i think that if i wouldve stayed home and watch the island of misfit toys i wouldve had more fun than watching this yawn inducing cia infested speye movie first off what the hell are all those damn flashbacks flash fowards and flashsideways all about so the dude gets put in prison get him out already and whats up with this island thing he did the switcharo with it was like hey we pulled off something cool no youre lame go see this movie if ya like to take dumpsnote i did not really like this movie that much,intelligence
i was relieved to see that this was not another patriotic ode to america as both the title and the plot may indicate sure we are supposed to care about the story simply because there is an american pitt sitting in an asian prison but instead of seeing the whole army going out of its way to get him out the story is about redfords character trying to con the cia who is reluctant to save him im glad the filmmakers took a slightly different approach than the obvious one but unfortunately that is not enoughnow we start off with pitt in prison and we are led to believe that the film will be of the great escape kind but no from then on and almost until the end of the film we are mostly fed flashbacks portraying pitts and redfords past in my point of view the film forgets about the story for almost two hours and picks it up again just to wrap it up the last 20 minutes the focus of the story is completely misplaced another bad side of this flashback technique is that the time span is 25 years both pitt and redford look exactly the same throughout this time span im sorry but that is not as easy to ignore as it was when the actors in schindlers list were speaking english tony scott has made a stylish film but he spends too much energy on the technical aspects the colors are very cold and this distances the viewerredford and pitt are both good and they save the movie from being completely uninteresting i cant see why redfords character had to be an agent just about to retire though i wonder why every screenwriter seems to believe that all agents are about to retirethe ending of the film is good and actually quite moving but oh so laterating 510,intelligence
tony scotts attempt to make an intelligent espionage thriller in the le carre mould comes off as turgid and ponderous creditable performances from redford and pitt are largely overwhelmed by stylised directing that detracts from rather than enhancing the storyline scott should stick to what he does best  big dumb action thrillers  and leave the mtv jumpshots and freeze frames to those who know how to use them effectively,intelligence
was okay action spy thriller there were some scenes in the movie which i didnt like and i think shouldnt of been there full stop if it wasnt for that im sure i would of enjoyed the movie much more the two main performances from brad pitt and robert redford were both good enough though all in all quite a good movie except for for the wrong scenes that i mentioned before,intelligence
director tony scott top gun delivers this highpaced action flick that although not completely original is an enjoyable action flick sure there may be a few plot holes but this one is out to be a crowd pleaser not a critics favorite robert redford and brad pitt each carry their roles well interestingly enough they never appear together in real time they only share the screen in the many flashback sequences   redfords character is clever and enjoyable to watch as he pulls off many stunts against his fellow cia agents to save his old protegee pitt from a chinese prison thankfully neither is trying to play a romantic lead as the story concentrates on the rescue rather than complicating the story with an unnecessary love interestwhile both actors do a good job the flashback sequences are quite humorous as the story goes back to the vietnam war and neither actor appears any younger even with the soft lights also theres a running time stamp on the movie which comes off as slightly silly it is indeed a hollywoodstyle action film from a director who was a safe bet because of his history of box office hits it comes off a little overthetop at times but will do well between the star power and safebet directionthis one is worth seeing in the theater if you would like to have your eyes glaze over and just enjoy a popcorn flick dont expect too much in the way of groundbreaking material and you will probably enjoy it every once in a while its good to have an entertaining action flick like this to turn to during the flood of questionably entertaining movies this holiday season if youre a big fan of action flicks or either actor check it out in the theater if not it wont kill you to wait for the video,intelligence
three brief comments 1 the interesting action story would have been brad pitt in china leading up to and away from the little bit that they did show but then thered no need for robert redford at all 2 tony scott should have gotten out of the way of the story whats with all the bw specialeffect cuts and weird hamhanded scene setups like the helicopter shot of them on top of the building 3 brad pitt was a little disappointing forced overthetop anger but he certainly had very little material to work with emotionally,intelligence
this was a very entertaining movie ruined by a few oversights  the biggest problem with movies that follow a tight timeline like this one is the director forgot a few basics  when one goes from 1960s  1990s characters are going to age  well not in this age  this is nothing compared to the fact that at 700 am in the us is 700pm in china so how is it possible that the final scene is shown as a sunrise in china and in the morning in the us in this day of age simple errors like this should not be overshadowed as it is a common fact to most people that if you are the other side of the world you cannot both have a sunrise at the same time  great fun but hollywood  all viewers are not ignorant and stupid,intelligence
writer michael bechner needs to do his homework  clearly just putting two great actors together does not make for a great movie  the acting was of course superb but the script had problems  for example and this is not at all central to the plot at one point redfords character says that he first met pitts character 25 years ago when they fought together in viet nam  25 years ago brad pitt was only 12 years old  now i know one can say that he was playing someone older than he really is but then the makeup artists should have made him look older  instead brad pitt simply looked like the brad pitt of today,intelligence
luckily i saw the sneak preview of yesterday i went in with good intentions as i saw the trailer and i think brad pitt and robert redford make an awesome duo on screen and man they sure did one heck of a moviefor all the people who will get a chance to see this amazing movie in 2 days time you wont regret it the begining sequence is just totally what you would expect from a tony scott film brad pitts character delivers the support that is needed but the credit of the film has to be given to none other than robert hijmself he just outdid himself this time especially towards the endanyone who likes brad pitt robert redford or an action story line with an amazing plot this movie is for you,intelligence

this the french la femme directed by luc besson is one of the strangest most bizarre yet psychologically truest movies ever made the story on the surface is absurd and something youd expect from a grade b international intrigue thriller anne parillaud plays a bitter drugdependent unsocialized child of the streets who is faster than a kung fu fighter and packs more punch than a mike tyson bite shes killed some people and is given a choice between death and becoming an assassin for the french governmentthis premise should lead to the usual actionadventure yarn with lots of fists flying guns going off people jumping off of buildings roaring through the streets in souped up vehicles spraying bullets etc as blood flows and bones shatter and something like that does happen however there is a second level in which nitika becomes the embodiment of something beyond an action adventure heroine she is coerced and managed by society her individuality is beaten out of her so that she can be molded into what the society demands she comes out of her training with her individuality compromised her free and natural spirit cowed but undefeated and alive and she sets out to do what she has been taught to do and then she falls in love and she notices somewhere along the way amid the murder and the mayhem that there is something better than and more important than and closer to her soul in this world than killing and being killed she finds that she prefers love to hate tenderness to brutality she sees herself and who she is for the first time but it is too late she cannot escape or can sheparillaud brings a wild animal persona tinged with beauty and unselfconscious grace to the role of marc duret plays rico the tender man she loves and tchky karyo is her mentor bob whom she also loves jeanne moreau the legend has a small part as amande who teaches lipstick application and how to be attractivenow compare this to the us remake called point of no return 1993 starring bridget fonda please do not even consider the vapid tv whats the difference well fondas flashier i suppose but nowhere is there anything like the psychological depth and raw animal magnetism found in the original the fonda vehicle is simply a onedimensional action flick stylishly done in a predictable manner bessons is a work of art that explores the human predicament and even suggests something close to salvationas always with a french film get the subtitled version the dubbing is always atrocious and anyway theres really not that much dialoguenote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,intelligence
i fell in love with this film from the moment i first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program at first i was drawn to the action elements being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes but i was blown away by the romance and character interplay i loved the composition of the scenes the noirish lighting and the quirky humor this movie along with pedro almodovars films really opened my eyes to european films particularly those with a signature stylethe performances are great across the board anne parillaud plays all facets of well from her rebellious drughazed beginning to her growing confidence and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart tcheky karyo made a huge impression mostly through his body language and his eyes he says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue jeanne moraeu is a treasure a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit jeanhughues anglade has the harder part the normal guy who falls for he is adept at comedy but is tender in the love scenes he carries himself well in his faceoff with bob finally the actor who really stands out in memory jean reno reno oozes charisma and talent even in bad films he steals the film the moment he entersluc besson is a tremendous stylist his films are beautiful even when the story is a bit obtuse he is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning his main fault is that he lets style overtake story but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting he is a fine writer although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for othersfinally one cant discuss the films of besson without discussing the music of eric serra serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration his compositions convey mood and emotion adding another layer to the story his signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments he demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers to transform the music rather than make up for lack of an orchestra or talent serras soundtracks were the first that i bought for instrumental music rather than for pop songs used in the film this is a film that appeals to many audiences there is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers unique character studies quirky humor and above all romance it has spawned many imitations point of no return black cat tv series but has never been equaled if you are a fan of film noir actionespionage character drama or romance you should see this film then you should own this film youll want to watch it again and again,intelligence
luc besson was on a hot streak in the late 80searly 90s and la femme or just for short is almost as good as he got at putting his own distinctive stamp on a genre that many auteurs have trouble molding the spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky as theres the chance for too much onedimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions squares this problem away just with the protagonist a young punk anne parillaud in her most recognizable near starmaking performance who kills a cop in the midst of a shootout is sentenced to life but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization and given an ultimatum become a spyassassin or die she complies and in a few years time turns into josephine who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maids outfit to serve potential targets or to ready herself to kill someone longrange at a moments noticebesson crafts his main story by creating a sort of love triangle between josephinemarie her boss bob and her conventional lover marco a grocery store cashier who doesnt know what she really does besson tools with the elements for a much more conventional thriller and from time to time it could appear like la femme will veer into that realm and not return but besson is smart he crafts the first hour like a kind of taming of the shrew saga or taming of a shrill badass filled with juicy dark humor ranging from the ultraviolent pencil in the hand anyone to the silly and playful training with karate instructors and as pure director of action sequences besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters its succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with bob even in the little things like the scene where she watches the spy put together the concoction for the target in the hotel works on the purest technical termsbut la femme for the most part also works on emotional levels too besson wont be above throwing in a hardboiled killer in the midst jean renos victor my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes and a precursor to leon but hell also subvert it just a tinge for good measure i loved seeing when josephine has to take out the woman in venice her shot in sight and is moved to tears through the words that marco speaks to her truthfully not in any terms that deem him as the boring safe character but as her kind of salvation from a life that shes been forced into as a final alternative as happens often in bessons work in fact the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and at the least harrowing times with the one she cares for or about ie portman in leon leeloo in fifth element joan of arc even angela in angela its not simply a gimmick in having the character be a woman its essential to bessons track as a filmmaker and praillaud is excellent for the sort of ups and downs the character goes through sometimes in the same scene this isnt to say there are a few minor liabilities if only from my perspective the music is usually effective in that early electronictechno beat style for a modern thriller yet sometimes its also a cross between a softcore porn and weather channel muzak the ending felt abrupt or at least on a first viewing albeit its hard to top the scene at the ambassadors hq and as a minor criticism what happened to showing how learns how to smile seems a little crucial as something of her personality thats skipped over when made to seem like a big stepping stone by jeanne moreaus enigmatic character otherwise a mustsee and one of bessons best films,intelligence
this 1989 french film was justifiably so popular that an american remake followed later and then a cable television series followed after that in this  the original  you see at its beginning and most people agree at her best anne parillaud an actress ive always found fascinating is riveting as the lead character jeanhuges anglade tcheky karyo and jean reno provide a very strong supporting castthe characters were believable and it was refreshing to see a nononsense approach to a murder story meaning if someone had to be killed they were shot quickly with no questions asked some of the action scenes are brutalparillauds character is memorable she can change appearances from a hard nosed hysterical animal to a real lady its also interesting to see reno in a familiar role as a cleaner a role he made famous four years later in leon the professional the dvd provides either easytoread subtitles or a welldone dubbed version if sound is important to you youll hear better stereo with the subtitled version,intelligence
anne parillaud is phenomenal as a terrifyingly vulnerable beautiful and human young antihero with an incredible talent for violence a drugaddict murderous teen is given a second chance by a government agency looking to exploit her penchant for conscienceless killing mentored by a man whose compassion for her is only matched by his ambition and machiavellian sadism ventures on a rollercoaster ride leading a doublelife as assassin and cleanliving young woman in love her passionate affair with marco and the clarity of her undrugged consciousness combine to promote the development of a conscience  a dangerous thing in her line of work is nevertheless a victim of her circumstances and like the rest of the characters on both sides seems stuck in a very bad situation in addition to the artistry with which this story is told this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and notsosubtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder jean reno fans will enjoy his brief typecast cameo as the cleanerthis is one of the best if not the best of bessons films it is extremely well paced starkly and beautifully shot and features some of the best acting and writing of the entire action genre the script is just a little better in french than english does not have the feel of an action film but rather feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak and spiced with just a tad of hope parillauds multilayered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film,intelligence
forget the awful series  forget the even worse hollywood remake the assassin  remember luc bessons la femme this has got to be one of the most stylish moody and gripping films in existence  luc bessons direction is refreshing whilst the cinematography is simply stunning particuarly the scene in the hotel where gets her first assignment  the soundtrack by eric serra is simply genius and actually adds something to the filmsoundtracks usually seem to be an afterthought but refreshingly not in this casethe beautiful anne parillaud is perfect in the lead role unlike bridget fonda and the subtle romance between her and tcheky karyo is pure eloquence  the hugely talented jeanhughes anglade of betty blue fame shines in this film but of all the male roles jean reno also fabulous in luc bessons leonis outstanding as the completely unbalanced victor the cleaner  jeanne moreau as amande makes a notable appearence following years of contributions in countless filmsluc besson established himself as one of the leading innovative directors with this film and you can easily see why  this movie certainly rates among the top 10 films of all timei could pontificate about this film all day and all night but the best thing is for you to watch it yourself as a matter of priorityit is a must seeim off now to pursue a career in international assassinations,intelligence

you could say i workfor the government weve decided to give you another chanceive been wanting to see la femma for ages as i used to be quite the fan of the tv show based on it when i was a kid its nice to be able to say that the movie was just as exciting and entertaining as i remember the show beingthe plot is about a young drug addict who kills a cop when she and some guys are caught robbing a pharmacy the french government fakes her death and shes given little alternative but to join a training program to become an agent in the governments employ the stress of living a violent life that she doesnt want and having to keep it secret from her fianc eventually becomes too much for her to cope withla femme has several impressive action sequences but its more than just an action movie transforms over the course of the story from a druggedup junkie with nothing to live for to a capable and dangerous woman who wants control over her own lifeall in all i thought la femme was a solid blend of assassination and drama the heroine is probably one of the most interesting female action protagonists ever put up on the big screen and its hard to overstate the impact has had on other female protagonists in these kinds of movies in the last twenty years recommended,intelligence
la femme is an uber90s extravaganza from noneother than luc besson the story involves a criminal given one of two choices become an assassin or die and thats the long and short of s story laying the ground work for frances response to the modern james bond films but much more extreme and grittier deaths to it its a movie that was made during the 80s90s aesthetic crossroad the same sort of thing that goodfellas managed to achieve when it was made a film of the decade right before running headlong into a decade that gave us the likes of toy story the usual suspects the matrix american beauty and so ongets 455 stars,intelligence

its smart stylish and violent with numerous welldirected action sequences but whats more surprising about la femme is its preoccupation with character development and the effective way in which it changes pace at various points to meet the needs of its story its wellwritten plot describes how a young woman who begins as a drugaddicted criminal is transformed into a more complex young lady who finds love and works for the french government as an assassin the changes that take place as this originally hostile defiant and volatile punk is moulded into a slightly more polished disciplined and caring individual are really entertaining to watch not least because of her unpredictability which makes the whole process so challenging edgy and even on some occasions humoroussoon after a group of junkies break into a paris pharmacy a squad of heavilyarmed police officers arrive on the scene and the ensuing gunfight results in fatalities on both sides in the mayhem all the gang members appear to have been killed but when one of the cops checks more thoroughly he finds a teenager called anne parillaud crouching down under a piece of furniture when shes approached by the cop who hesitates because he isnt certain whether or not shes a gang member she callously shoots and kills him after being sentenced to life in prison for her crime shes given what she suspects is a lethal injection and later wakes up in a white room where a man called bob tcheky karyo visits herbob who works for an unnamed government agency shows her evidence that her death has been faked and recorded as a suicide with her body having been buried in row 8 plot 30 of the maisonsalfort cemetery he goes on to offer her the opportunity of a new life working for the government which she readily accepts when she realises that the only other option is row 8 plot 30 three years of intensive training follow during which she becomes proficient in the use of guns martial arts and computers as well as learning various points of etiquette and also how to act like a lady after successfully completing her final test which involves carrying out an assassination in a restaurant is given her freedom and a new identity marie as a covert agent however she knows shell be expected to respond immediately whenever shes called upon to carry out any assassinationssoon finds happiness in her new life as a result of meeting supermarket checkout man marco jeanhugues anglade whos goodnatured friendly and charming the couple fall in love and move in together and although shes blissfully happy in the relationship feels uncomfortable about not being able to share any details of her past with marco and also having to be disingenuous on certain occasions when she has to coverup for being involved in carrying out a hit despite this difficulty she manages to continue satisfactorily with both her relationship and her job until she decides that a change of course is necessary after marco discovers that shed lied to him about being employed at a hospital and she nearly gets killed when one of her government jobs goes horribly wrongas anne parillaud is astonishingly good because shes equally credible as the nasty vicious and feral punk whos initially seen in the robbery as she is in the various stages that she goes through as she morphs into the more controlled and emotionally mature person that she gradually becomes its unusual for an action movie to feature a character of this type and also for their portrayal to be so convincingla femme is an ultrastylish movie that features some great action sequences one of which culminates in a superb stunt when the eponymous antiheroine escapes danger by leaping down a laundry chute despite such excitement however what remains most memorable about the movie is its central character and the amazing transformation that she goes through,intelligence
i remember back in the 90s i had the iconic poster which had a very leggy anne parillaud kitted out in a little tight black dress while cocking a huge hand gun it was one of the definitive movie posters of its day and went some way in adding to the films overall reputation as something cool that had to be seen over the years has become less well remembered but it definitely remains one of the high points of the french cinma du look movement it follows the story of a violent drug addicted young woman who is imprisoned for killing a police officer during an armed robbery recognising her skills as useful a secret government agency fakes her death and gives her the opportunity to be reborn in a new life as a professional killerdirected by luc besson this is a fairly typical example of his work at its best where we have an actionthriller which is elevated by an ultrastylish presentation it has a very glossy veneer to it with some chic fashions and ornate locations but in amongst that it does have some grit the central character played by parillaud really exemplifies this where she is moulded into a sophisticated killer but who underneath is a feral street fighter parillaud definitely covers a lot of ground here in a strong performance she isnt afraid to play the character very unglamorous and annoying where required  the slinky creature on the poster is only part of the deal here the transformation of this character is overseen by an enigmatic agent called bob who develops feelings for his charge while reconfiguring her its a storyline which has definite parallels to pygmalion in fact much of isnt really in thriller territory at all much focus is made of the relationship embarks on in the latter half of the film with a shop assistant played by jeanhugues anglade who in a neat role reversal plays a part which is typically played by women in most films of these kinds anglade is the good natured partner who is s anchor on reality while she embarks on her secret and deadly missions one particularly exemplary example of this occurs in a scene in venice where she assassinates a designated victim while having a conversation with anglade through a bathroom door its scenes like this one and others where the central character embarks on her missions where the film usually peaks for me in one of these latter sequences we are introduced to the sinister character of the cleaner in a role played by jean reno which was so striking that besson based one of his next films around this idea namely leon 1994i think may be the best film that besson ever made the combination of an interesting central character good concept and stylised direction add up to an actionthriller of significant pedigree it was remade in america with bridget fonda in the lead role under the title of point of no return 1993 a film which many people seem to hate but which i actually thought was a very good alternative so my advice would be watch both and decide for yourself,intelligence
i watched this film when it first came out and then watched it again and again analyzing it ad nauseum to try and learn a thing or two yes it is that good i like a few other luc besson films but this one is a notch or two above his other creationsis a story about a drug addicted woman who becomes a government agent or rather  an assassinthat part of the story is presented really well and provides more than enough excitement to support the entire film but what makes this film so good is everything that happens below the surface complex relationships unfinished business never knowing if she will do this or that yet none of it feels forced or contrived it all makes perfect sensei read some negative reviews here and was wondering if those people even watched this film their questions almost feel like they should not be allowed in theaters alone carefully watching a film such as this one will go a long way toward enjoying itperhaps the only problem with la femme is that it came out at the time when no one knew who luc besson was and with minimal if any promotion armchair filmcritics found it to be an easy target for unjustified negativity too many people are on a lookout for what seems like an easy target for their vitriol and this film did not come with any big names attached so they could not pass on the opportunitythe true greatness of this film is best illustrated by the fact that numerous tv shows and a remake or two were made soon after it came out you know a film is good when other filmmakers are aching to make it again and they fail to exceed its high standardsthe only other real problem with this film may be its subtitles since i speak french i simply listen rather than read but a few times that i took a look at subtitles i was shocked that they were so far off  it felt almost like someone was trying to change the story with their subtitles if memory serves me well the original vhs actually had excellent translation as did the theatrical release but dvd and bluray suffer from bad english subtitles maybe bluray less so dont remember any moreall in all action packed brutally honest crime drama yes governments do hire former criminals to be their assassins with a heart the single most important point of this film is not action but the main characters arc enjoy it and discover it yourselfthis is one of the finest examples of what french cinema is capable of hollywood cannot even come close,intelligence
this movie is almost identical to the american movie the assassin the american movie is based so heavily on this movie that even the lines are identical this movie the original is by far better because the americans just did not use any imagination with the assassinis a wild drugaddicted punk who is caught in a drug store after a hold up has gone terribly wrong she is a wild animal and when she is confronted by the police instead of pretending to be a frightened she blows his head off and is thus arrested and charged for the murder of the other officers she is sentenced to life imprisonment and subsequently killed the catch is is that the death is faked and she is revived in a secret government organisation and trained as an assassinthe american movie is very glizty as is typical of hollywood they made everything look nice and sophisticated including bridget fonda is nothing like this luc besson has the ability to use the dark and dingy effectively is wild and her unkept appearance is made to reflect this through the movie we watch her as she is slowly tamed and made into a civilised woman even so we still receive glimpses of who she waswith civilisation comes morality when she was wild she killed the cop without a second thought but as she is tamed she begins to realise the results of her actions she is ordered to kill a woman and after the truth of her actions hits her as she falls in love with a young checkout clerk marco we watch how her passions rise up inside of her and how the sanctity of human life dawns upon her we see a different woman retch at the sight of victor the cleaner pouring acid on a living body than when she kills a cop in cold bloodthe action in the assassin mimics the action in almost identically yet in we see that luc besson has created something that is real the agency is not a high tech cement bunker but the basement of an old building with walls with crumbling plaster the bed is an old hospital bed and the floor is bathroom tiles the major difference is that we see two worlds in the two movies the assassin is america and is france the new world and the old world paris and los angeles is by far the better movie,intelligence
i saw this film when i was young 12 years old maybe and i simply loved it we are following the story of this unruly woman who is trying to do better in a world that is not necessarily that friendly all the actors are excellent showing a great strength and sensitivity at the same timeas in most films by luc besson there is a dark sense of humor that could speak even to the young,intelligence
i think i probably watched this film at the wrong time i first saw the americanlanguage remake assassin back in the early nineties and have only just got round to watching the film it was based on or la femme to be precise therefore its hard to accept that the french version is the original source material and not the remake both stay pretty much on the same storytelling path telling the tale of a downandout drugaddled young woman killing a police officer in a burglary gone wrong but eluding the death penalty in favour of working for a secret government agency to off those who need disappearing yes the plot is possibly a little farfetched but if you can suspend your disbelief long enough youll find that its well worth itwhat you get is the story of a tortured soul whos trying to make a fresh start of her life and yet keeps finding herself dragged back into the covert ways of the spy agency to do their dirty work you will definitely feel for the lead and the writing is pretty solid for her and all those she encounters its one of those rare films where there isnt a discernible baddie to take on the badguy if it can be considered so is the situation shes found herself in and her attempts to  once again  change her life for the better and truly escape the shackles shes found herself in  whether a slave to drug abuse or the governments whimsi think the best thing about is its realism yes i know ive already said you have to suspend your disbelief to appreciate it but hear me out  in many modern films where the lead is a female action hero who spends her time beating up dozens of burly men who stand in her way you feel that  although cool to look at  it may not happen that way in real life however in she never uses her physical strength to overpower and takedown her targets instead she uses her wits and deadeye with a snipers rifle to get the dirty job done and get home in time for tea with her new fellaim glad ive watched the original its a decent film which blends action with genuine emotion for the characters plus its worth noting that it was good enough to inspire whoever greenlit its american remake not to change it so much that its barely recognisable and remained true to what made it great in the first place,intelligence
one of the better french films youll see not that this says much as most french movies are pretentious crap on the other hand is far from thata woman in a criminal gang is captured after killing a policeman during a botched robbery she is sentenced to life in prison but while in prison she is approached by a government agent who intends to make her a secret agent she reluctantly goes along with the ideainteresting engaging espionage drama with some great action scenes plot is good and the story follows well the set up is also well done and quite funny at times quite gritty too has all the traits of a good dramaso good hollywood remade as point of no return  the assassin in 1993 with bridget fonda in the lead role it was also made into a canadian tv series la femme the series lasted from 1997 to 2001 and starred peta wilson in the lead role,intelligence
when it comes to spy cinema americans generally know it through franchises like james bond mission impossible the bourne series and spy kids those films generally paint two portraits of the spy life either glamorous and exotic or intense and brutal is an interesting film in the genre while it certainly leans more towards the latter its one of the very films in the genre that both shows a realistic depiction of spy life but at the same time stylizes it but does work as a film lets find outthe plot follows a teenage junkie by the name of who gets arrested one night after partaking in a drug store robbery that goes horribly wrong where she murders a policeman in coldblood making her guilty of serving a life sentence however the french government fakes a suicide for her to become a spyassassinwhats interesting about is its look into the life of a spy this isnt james bond theres no gadgets no witty oneliners and no largerthanlife villains what we have instead is a look into a woman being turned by the french government from a teenage junkie to a dangerous killing machine is a woman who starts out with no meaning in life as she hangs around with junkies and is addicted to drugs herself but after shes trained to be a spy she becomes a lethal killing machine but in the meantime becomes refined mentally stable and even attractive whats interesting about this is the morality on one hand she murdered a policeman so she deserves punishment but at the same time once she gets out of spy school she cares and appreciates not just for her life but also for society and towards the end she ditches her mission and runs away to leave the life of a spy the films message can be pretty much be chalked up to everybody deserves a second chance and its delivered beautifully because its not rammed down your throat with lines like maybe deserves another chance maybe she never deserved this in the first place which would have dumbed down the entire movieoutside of the morality behind the film is also very stylish director luc besson directs this film with a strange mix of realism and style but somehow it works this movie has its fair share of brutal realism with scenes like the cleaner using acid to melt down the bodies of those he killed or trying to break out by threatening her supervisor bob at gunpoint but theres also scenes of style such as the speech her instructor amande tells about femininity and the means of using it or the scenes of training comically in spy school the reason this works is because neither styles go too far so they end up complimenting each other and creating its own style rather than making for something inconsistent and jarring the cinematography by thierry arbogast is also quite good at creating this gritty stylized lookbut with all that good said this is not a perfect movie one of its biggest flaws is the confused timeframe presented in the story the movie spans over years of training to become a spy but the way its edited makes it feel like only a few weeksmonths have gone by so when one of the heads of the organization says has been training here for six years youll just be left sitting there like wait its been six yearsanother problem is the character of marco hes just really bland and uninteresting throughout hes supposed to be the man who wins s heart and make her appreciate life more but the thing is while he seems like a really nice guy his interactions with arent very interesting he questions her here and there about things like why she never has friends or family over at her place or why she spends so much time in the bathroom ignoring him but it never amounts to anything more than that i wouldve liked to see him actually get mad at her at one point and have an argument play out i think that wouldve been a little more interestingthe last of the major problems is the score by eric serra it just sounds incredibly bland and sterile throughout theres some scenes in the film where i literally felt like ripping my hair out because of how mindinducingly dull it is although i did like the music when the cleaner was taking care of businesshowever those problems arent nearly strong enough to ruin the film because of the excellent cast anne parillaud gives a truly spectacular performance as her change from teenage junkie to refined assassin is very believable and all her conflicting emotions about being a spy feel very real and believable tcheky karyo plays bob fascinatingly with a polite persona but with an underlying intensity that makes you really think and question his feelings towards effectively while i thought his character was a little bland jean hugues anglade does the best he can as marco and remains likable the entire film lastly while the

upon cinematic release being fascinated with bridget fonda i watched point of no return which i enjoyed but had no idea it was based on bessons film badhams work was okay in my books but nothing spectacular over the years i had loved those films of his i had seen leon the professional the fifth element the family and lucy and decided i wanted to see his earlier classic i like the fact that besson always has some hand in the writing and the exquisite and graceful small part he wrote for acting legend jeanne moreau virtually a microcosm of everything splendid she had ever brought to the screen besson has a very good feel for the genres his films representhe plays to his strengths and is not afraid to stick to his guns for example im glad he chose the ending that he did the two significant extras on my dvd remarking on the making of the film and the sound selections by scorer eric serra were both informative and entertaining and added significant value i highly recommend the experience to those who only think of the fifth element when they think of lucs workyoure in for a real treat,intelligence
from the outset is a classy film luc besson really knows his stuff and as i watched this film i could see the quality of character and direction he gives the movie the lead actress i have read on here is apparently ugly  well what does that have to do with the story did she have to be a hot piece of ass no she didnt she was cast as she is a great actress who was physically right and most believable for the role luc besson is not interested in satisfying horny teenagers he is making a proper film that has stood the test of time from the beginning the story grips you  is a teenage psychotic tear away with a group of friends equally as bad after a cool shootout and the murder of a cop she is arrested and sentenced to life in prison a story is fabricated that she committed suicide and she is given the option by the government to become their assassin or be killed the whole first part of the movie is very strong as develops from a miserable aggressive psycho into a human being again her relationship with her mentor is very understated and interesting she is released into society again after passing her initial test or first assignment this is the real highlight of the film  a cool shoot out in a restaurant once back into society she meets a man and falls in love and basically starts enjoying life with a new perspective and value for her own life and that of others however the government are not far away with more assignments for her all this is still very entertaining however as we edge towards the end i did feel it sagged a little her last assignment is not really gripping enough and i was getting a little bored however the very end as the two men who fell in love with her meet just after she has gone on the run is very satisfying and it stops at the right point to leave the viewer with an almost sad feeling i like this film very much the lead actress is brave fearless and shows great range i love the relationship with the mentor and the action is used at the right time apart from the end it would have been perfect 810,intelligence
josephine in her little black dress crouched in a hotel kitchen huge smoking handcannon swaying in her delicate little paws not entirely sure what shes doingequals my alltime favourite movie poster and an enduring image of a wonderfully crafted absorbing study of love penance and obligation throw in a funky pulsing score and you have a modern classic the film is generally slowpaced save for a couple of genuinely exciting and achingly cool setpieces and is more an examination of maries transformation and rehabilitation than anything else if you want consistent highoctane thrills then look elsewhere because this beautiful film packs an emotional rather than physical punch anne parillaud as marie josephine in the lead role is breathtaking and her failure to feature since in any picture of note baffles me she is the centrepiece of the film aggressive fragile tactile ugly beautiful cold efficient she runs the gamut of human emotion and in doing so lingers on as one of the most complex and memorable female characters in recent movie history time is a central character here much as in gaspar noes irreversible it is allpowerful and destroys everything good and bad its passage is portrayed regularly symbolic of maries simultaneous progress and rehabilitation the lighting here is also effective giving the film an almost washedout feel hollywood again take note this is a real film about love and pain of the most excruciating kind of having no control identity or direction and hurting those about whom you care the most a mustsee,intelligence
lived in my mind as an action movie with lots of blood aggression fear all kinds of things im not very fond of to watch in a cinema but i have seen this film more than ten years ago and things change and now is not that cruel movie anymorei came back to rewatch after a lecture i heard about spontaneity and creativity the speaker cited as an example for spontaneity he told about the scene when gets the guns in the red box as a present and is told to kill a man behind her in the restaurant run out of the room look for the mens toilet check the last cabinet and climb out on the small window there with place only for a women of her size to get through the car is waiting for her for 5 minutes outside does as told shoots runs searches opens the window  but then the windows is walled and here starts spontaneity  what to do now in fact i watched the entire movie to see this scene  wow i learned again somethingotherwise is rather a sweet action movie by my standards of today the storyline is interesting the playing is ok just the whole is unpolished and a bit rough to me however no question back then this movie was the starter for a whole series of story lines and luc besson merits credit for his originality 710,intelligence
until i watched this film many years ago id always associated foreign language films with more talky arty films this showed that there are top quality action films made outside hollywood toothe film opens with a group of drug addicts breaking into a pharmacy to steal drugs things go wrong and most of them are shot and killed by the police however survives but she is captured and jailed for the murder of a police officer she doesnt end up in jail though she is taken in by a government agency and given the choice of working for them or being killed she chooses to work for them and spends three years being trained in a variety of skills that will enable her to work as an assassin on her twenty third birthday bob her handler takes her out of the training facility for the first time she thinks it is just for a meal but ends up having to kill somebody and then fight her way out of the restaurant this is her final test before being allowed to leave the facility and make a life for herself she isnt totally free though whenever the agency calls she must drop whatever she is doing and perform a mission this is complicated by the fact that she now has a fianc who does not know what she doesthe action scenes are all very stylishly executed and the acting seemed good although not speaking french i had to rely on the subtitles to understand what was being said id certainly recommend this to anybody who likes action films especially to people who liked luc bessons later film leon the main character of which is based on victor the cleaner in ,intelligence
no  this movie doesnt work yes it starts out well but it gets worsethe newage music as she is going thru weapons training was ludicrous then she acts like a retarded 5 year old while conducting her affair so unappealing esp when compared with the fabulous jeanne moreaui did not believe her transformation into an emotional mess in the midst of the mission she was supposed to be a trained professional killer i did not believe love had turned her soft this was unrealisticcompare linda fiorentino in the last seduction now she could do the jobi suppose the french just cant do gangsters sigh,intelligence
luc bessons was one of the most stylish action thrillers to come out in 1990 it was a big hit in cinemas and vhs even in countries that dislike films with subtitlesthe film was remade a few years later as the assassin with bridget fonda but anne parillaud is stunning as the street delinquent fashioned into a kick ass assassin by her mentor bob tcheky karyoshe is trained and becomes an operative for a shadowy government agencyluc besson shoots this film in a stylish moody way something he established a few years earlier in the film subway eric serras electronic soundtrack is more appropriate here than it was later in goldeneyethe acting is very good from the stars ranging from parillaud karyo jeanne moreau and jean reno as bob the cleaneryou care about the characters and the story moves along at a rapid rate,intelligence
anne parillaud is a drugged out violent criminal when she and her cohorts end up in a drugstore shootout with police she kills one of the officers shes sentenced to life in prison then a secret organization breaks her out of prison fakes her suicide and bob tchky karyo trains her to be a secret agentthis is luc besson as the cool french director sure its not realistic but its super cool one thing is sure the man has style and he has a few funny things to add no where else is a guy getting slapped so hilarious hes doing an action movie not with a muscle bound meat head but with a skinny chick the action looks good the missions are memorable theyre over the top stylized ridiculousness,intelligence
this isnt my typical movie genre i am more interested in character drama than action movies this is able to span both genres in a way that hollywood hasnt managed to accomplish the plot was interesting and the acting by anne parillaud was exceptionali had seen the american remake called point of no return and found it to be an ok movie but i wanted to see the original i am glad that i did the technical aspects of direction and editing are very good the plot was interesting  revolving around the timeless theme of redemption the acting made this an exceptional moviefor fans of the action genre they will be quite happy for those like myself who are more interested in character and plotdriven movies may find this to be a pleasant surprise as well,intelligence
while good does not approach the high art that is len while the fact that this plot has been imitated so frequently must make it seem less original than at its release it was never really ironclad to begin with on the other hand it fits perfectly the more characterdriven progression that is the movies aim like bessons masterpiece a strong character in difficult situations powers the film yet for all her gender issues is simply not developed enough to support the considerable weight bestowed upon her by this directors deadserious style yet this is structural and by no means the fault of perillaud who is excellent she pulls off many instances of double roles which are not easy she is strong but unsure brutal yet smart masculine but feminine animal yet human to accentuate this is the artful but not annoying cinematography which has what seems like a fresh angle and style for all the various aspects of while not entirely typical neither was the score entirely memorable and while this film has much more to offer it must be said that the action scenes were firstrate never tame and often surprising they gave a true sense of struggle rather than any glorification of gore overall the film is excellent as action strong as a film and worth seeing in the original french 710,intelligence
what a film and what a plot those were the years when this film came out i still remember all of it when it came out and watching it during those years the scene when victor the cleaner comes in it became a classic it was later copied by helen mirren in red 2it was later remade by hollywood that film i still did not seeit is one of the french classicsi really wonder is the plot made from the real life where luc besson got the idea fromit is one of must seeeven for you lazy who do not like to read subtitles,intelligence
its about a psycho who killed a policeman and later offered training to kill for secret services rather than go to prison the film is perfect in most of the senses and especially for the very powerful and extraordinary story it grabs you from the beginning and it ends up without giving you a hint that it would end which leaves you with a question in mind it could have been a little longer so its very successful but the only thing which disturbed me was the age of she is 20 in the film but actually she is 30 in real life so i never get the same strong feeling only for when i watched mathilda in leon but you get used to it even if with some difficulty music is used less but still the scenes are very powerful a classical luc besson film characters are very strong one by one and each one has the ability to draw your attentionanother negative point for me is that there is no any scene that i would want to watch again with great appetite its a one night stand film you watch you like very much and you never forget,intelligence

i just caught this on bravo and i must say it was very well done  i have been a luc besson fan ever since the first time i saw the professional and after reading so many good reviews about la femme i just had to see it first off i was a little apprehensive about seeing this one due to the horrible point of no return but i am glad that i did because the remake does not do the original any justice at all  and yes it is in french with american subtitles but even for those who simply abhor subtitles it is not a problem with  bessons direction and characters grip you on the edge of your seat nearly the whole time and the dialogue is crisp and to the point  this and the professional flow so nicely that there are no dull moments at allit is an action flick with substance a combination that is very hard to find but a pleasure to watchthe actress who plays is top notch and very believable  two of my favorite actors who happened to be in this film really stood out from the rest  tcheky karyo as bob really was wonderful as the mysterious mentor of who harbors a secret love for her  i wish there had been more of this relationship in the moviei think it would have developed into a really interesting love triangle  jean reno was also in this one playing it cool once again as the cleaner who is the epitome of brutal efficiency he steals every scene that he is in in a role that is very similar to leon in the professionali am still amazed at how this movie is worlds apart from point of no returnespecially the relationship with and her fianceein ponr it was horribly unbelievable but in it is quite the opposite s remake fails to deliver the believability of this relationship and in essence bores the viewer incredibly throughout the entire middle of the film  though as i said before has very few dull moments  kudos to besson for having the talent to truly grip his audience and not rely on just impressive gunfightsoverall an excellent film worthy of multiple viewings  my only complaints are the fact that there are several lapses of time that are poorly executed for example in one scene seduces a charming grocery store clerk and one scene later they are talking like theyve known each other for yearsit is then we find out oddly they have been together for 6 mos and the ending spoilers ahead  the whole movie kept me gripped and then it just kinda ended  no real character epitomizing finale all we get is conversation between two of our supporting leads and then we find out she is gone  she just leaves with apparently no worries that she will be tracked down by the agency  i felt something was really missing from the ending especially since we had seen this slow transformation from cold blooded killer into a loving human being other than that though the movie was top notchend spoilersfans of the professional will love this one  this is a great film that has a lot of substance and a lot of crowd pleasing action and suspense  910 stars,intelligence

gave rise to both a big budget hollywood movie starring the everfetching bridget fonda point of no return and a television series starring peta wilson the series found a loyal audience it was a cult favorite and had a successful run of some ninetysix episodesthe us movie and the tv series each took a somewhat different tack with the material though they started from the same place this says something for the concepts found in luc bessons excellent story but the most exceptional aspect of is anne parillauds gripping and unforgettable performance her portrayal of the conflicted nihilistic punk has served as a model for a host of strong female characters from buffy to sydney bristow alias the depth and complexity parillaud brings to the fragile yet deadly character of makes this one of the most memorable performances on film,intelligence
firstly all hail to luc besson a god amongst film makers i have never seen one of his films that i dont rate very highly although some are a little bizarresecondly  anne parillaud simply stunning and a pretty good actress too how much better than is this than its awful hollywood counterpart  no one can make a french film like the french and as to the subtitles id rather have them than some dreadful botched dubbing jobthen youve also got jeanhugues anglade and jean reno in support both matchless how long has it taken hollywood to discover jean reno and a fine performance from tcheky karyo to round the whole thing offthe action is nonstop the character development is excellent no flat characters here and the plot has pace covering several years of her life without the need to tell you it is doing sonot going to give the plot away but if you find buy it but make sure its the original,intelligence
i loved this film its hard to say more but i do love this film luc besson created a masterpiece when he wrote about a troubled woman becoming a cold assassin well executed well structured and edgy this film helped define french cinema the same way breathlessweekend and the 1000 blows did in the early days of the french new wave a classic in the making to say the least while bessons leon is a better movie this film will always be visionary jean renos role may have been small but he was easily the coolest character in the film a stunning array of visual artistry and action its too bad besson had a hand in making the horrible point of no return,intelligence
oh dear a film that is hailed as a classic but im afraid it doesnt live up to its hype there are plenty of problems with and the gravity of these in this modern day outweighs its good points the main problem is the story itself the government decides to fake the death of a mentally deranged murdering drug addled junkie in order to spend years training her to become a covert operativeassassin erm  of all the people to chose from they opted for that didnt they have any applicantsok well try and move past that and get on with the film  only to find that the film doesnt really get on settles down with a man and then occasionally gets assigned jobs however these jobs are not particularly interesting nor are they numerous enough to let quantity make up for quality then the film ends after a climax which offers nothing of interest and then leads to a bizarre end i watched the credits arrive and i honestly thought i must have accidentally skipped the dvd forward by 10 chapters wheres the rest of it whens the good stuff going to startthe film just doesnt know where it is supposed to be going is it an action film is it a film about a woman trying to change her life is it a film about the strengths of feminine guile im not sure even besson knows and this shows in the fact that it seems to explore a few angles at various points in the film but doesnt cement any of them so you really dont get inspired by any of the options for discussionperhaps 20 years ago the flaws would have been hidden somewhat by the exciting style of film making that besson employed but since many many films have copied this style since you will be watching nothing new,intelligence
is well esconced in the 80s even though it came out in 1990  the music the clothing style the hair styles etc  for 80s nostalgia buffs it works  my main problem with this film is in plot development  some of the portions of the movie were disjointed  for example when bob informs she has 2 weeks to shape up or ship out in a box nothing is shown of the transformation  all we see is being released to the outside world  one has to make the assumption she has the skills necessary to be a spyassassin and control of her psychotic nature  i also didnt believe parrauds character falling for the checkout clerk in such a quick fashion and actually maintaining anything like a normal life outside of her other life as an assassin  parraud goes a little over the top in trying to portray a psychotic woman and when she sings her song about the mouse or jumps up on a chair pretending to be a gondolier its just pretty awful i did like the camera work where they follow a bullet from her gun to a wall where a man was hiding  if luc besson made this movie today there would be a lot more details in s character and in her special training as an assassin a la neo in the matrix  after saying all that however i think is worth checking out because of its originality and being ahead of its time,intelligence
every time when a film by luc besson is released in franceit invariably ends up in the creation of a major event of unmatched intensitythis was exactly the feeling felt in france when hit french screens in 1990luc besson is an important director in the history of french cinemahe is one of the few french directors whose works have been hailed by critics as well as viewersif one states that cinema of look concept has been initiated by jean jacques beinex it must be added that luc besson merits a justified place in that categoryis a complete concept filmalthough it has its fair share of weaknesses but its strengths in many departments has made it a cult filmthe weak areas are something about which director luc besson could not have done much as it is difficult to incorporate comedy and love story in an action filma major weak spot concerns the role played by famous french actress jeanne moreauher presence was completely out of focus in a film dominated by major action stars like tcheky karyo and jean renothe theme of love felt by the boyfriend of an ex junkie transformed into spy was also too hot for jean hughes anglade to handlethis is one reason why nothing much can be said about the love chemistry between anne parillaud and jean hughes angladethe strengths of this film include its hypnotic musical score and taut editinga couple of sentences should also be written about action scenes filmed in they seem to be the handiwork of nihilists hell bent on destroying the social fabric of a civilized society,intelligence
long before there were all of the edgy dangerous and sexy women we now see in action films every day there was anne parillaud in the over two decades since this seminal film was produced unfortunately they have never produced another actress quite like her when i first viewed this movie i was totally unprepared for what i was going to see a virtual force of nature in a slim female figure as a working actor myself there are certain things that make a great actor or a great performance part of this magic involves someone who not only fully understands the character but brings the creative energy and intelligence to the role fearlessly and without selfconsciousness parillaud was like watching a master class in the art of acting she embodied all of these essential qualities and more but with all the many good young actors today none could have played the part with such a fully realized landscape of every human emotion imaginablefrom druginduced psychosis to unfettered youthful rebellion to total surrender and adulthood then ultimately morphing to a beautiful compromise of each rather than recount all the story points of this movie i only wish the reader to simply pick up a copy of this film and watch the original do her thing i can only describe her fabulous performance as feral watch it,intelligence
farfetched certainly but this odd sort of streetwise female variation on a james bond thriller still has a lot more character and fun than the vast majority of modern mainstream action films a drugged out almost braindead punk full of attitude and anger is caught after helping rob a drug store leaving several cops dead shes given a choice accept a quiet death penalty or agree to be trained to be a secret government assassin a good part of the film and arguably the most interesting is her training itself as s rebellious nature keeps getting her pushed to the edge of getting kicked out and hence executed while her strange sullen sexiness begins to seduce her henry higgins an agent assigned to oversee her who finds himself getting more than a bit obsessed meanwhile the always wonderful jeanne moreau tries to teach this nihilistic punk how to come off as a woman of the world the better to be able to get close to her targets this is often argued to be a film of style over substance and in the big picture thats probably fair and it didnt hold up quite as well on a recent 2nd viewing 20 years later as i hoped but still this spends more time on human interaction and emotion and less on blowing stuff up than almost any of its contemporary counterparts not art but for a popcorn movie smart inventive and fun,intelligence

luc besson manages to take a rather mundane story and infuses it with so much style that one forgets its mediocrity this is not a dig but a compliment is a thriller of sorts but also a story of the dregs of society coming to find her own sense of humanity when the story threatens to be come predictable it refrains nicely from doing so even flouts conventions by simply moving on as opposed to wasting precious film with unnecessary scenes of crises overcome the characters are perfectly portrayed with a convoluted love story both tender and sadistic jean reno sort of steals the show at one of the pivotal moments for our heroine but it only adds to the complexity of the emotional side of the story and forces the viewer to keep up shot composure was incredible where even the prosaic becomes a source of fascination the score while a tad 80s adds to the story instead of just being an afterthought with besson at his finest this is a must see for all lovers of the cinemaevil eye reviews,intelligence

this is the most violent film i have ever seen i dont particularly like violent films im not a huge action fan and i dislike thrillers but i was completely spellbound by this filmive never left another theater and found myself walking with my back to the wallthere are other films with more blood and gore more dead bodies more gunshots and more action but for sheer cold violence  victor nettoyer  nothing comes close to la femme and the violence doesnt stop at the physical  it continues down burrowing down into the psychology but the reasons it is so good are not so easy to identify there may be clues in the many spinoffs and remakes may provide some clues  because none of them are remotely close so it cant be purely the story or the premise and other actors with arguably more experience havent delivered on the role so its not solely the acting or actorsand there are some aspects of the production that are distinctly unpromising  in particular the fact that the director created the film purely as a vehicle to allow friend parillaud to break out of the stereotype straightjacket she was sewn into by her prior roles theres no doubt peraud is attractively packaged and for males at least the role could create a fatal fascination with the female spider but dropping other attractive actresses into hot roles is usually a guarantee of mediocrity or comicstrip soft pornperhaps the foreign language helps to make the other world both more exotic yet more believable at the same time but there must be far more to it than thatso often directors writers actors and studios set out to make a great film and despite all the money talent and attention it goes nowhere specialyet on some less promising evening all the stars and planets align on cue the story may be discomforting the violence offensive actors and directors you have never heard of in a language you cannot understand  but you are absolutely transfixedthere are some weak points to the film particularly in the early going where belief is stretched too thin before you are drawn down into another world it is unfortunate because these probably could have been avoided and the film would have approached perfection it would be nice to give it a 10 but its not therebut even as it is i find it amazing that a film can be so good as to make me love something i dont likeyou may not enjoy this film you may not approve of this film you might not sleep easily after this film but you will feel as though you have seen truly great cinemathe downside films like this make runofthemill tv and movies impossible to waste your time watchingexcept perhaps pulp fiction but the spiders web there was more coarsely spun,intelligence
anne parillaud is a teenage delinquent street punk and heroin abuser who  as a means of securing another fix  participates in the robbery of a pharmacy owned by the parents of her fellow junkie friend unfortunately for them the robbery goes horribly awry degenerating into a gunfight with the local police during which her cohort is killed suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms she shoots a police officer is then arrested tried convicted of murder and imprisoned for life with parole considered after thirty years in prison she is drugged to simulate a death sentence eventually waking up in an anonymous room where a welldressed hard man tchky karyo enters and reveals to her that although officially dead and buried after a suicide by overdose she is in actual fact in the custody of the dgse the french intelligence agency she is given a choice work as a dgse assassin or be killed after some resistance she chooses the former and proves a talented killer one of her trainers amande jeanne moreau transforms her from grimy gutter trash into a stylish femme fatalela femme or as it is more commonly known 1990 was very much the prototype for director luc bessons subsequent film the similarly stylish hit manthemed thriller lon 1994 albeit on a smaller scale and with a slightly more feminist edge here alongside certain visual motifs and preoccupations with movement and rhythm we can already see the thematic fascination with hit men mob bosses hotel room shootouts and the juxtaposition between femininity and a degree of required masculinity  as well as an early appearance from besson regular jean reno as a character that very much prefigures the one that he would subsequently go on to portray  all taking shape as the foundation for something much more substantial not that la femme is simply a mere experiment for that later work on the contrary this is possibly bessons true birth as a filmmaker of real emotional depth and the first of three flatout masterpieces that he directed in the 1990sprevious besson films such as those tied fairly rigidly to the confines of the cinema du look movement  a brief cinematic resurgence in 1980s french cinema that saw a younger generation of filmmakers looking back to the days of godard truffaut and the nouvelle vague to create popculture referencing films dealing with doomed love and alienated parisian youth  were high on style but low on plot take for example his first feature film the wordless black and white science fiction surrealist parable le dernier combatthe last battle 1983 which created an entirely authentic postapocalyptic future world on an incredibly limited budget but then fell back on having its lead actors jean reno and former pop star pierre jolivet do nothing for the remaining ninety minutes other than attempt to outwit each other in a series of physical and mental tests his second film the much more colourful and lively subway 1985 developed the visual ideas established in the first films of jean jacques beineix and leos carax  alongside elements of action comedy and revisionist film noir  though again often at the substitution of routine plot and easily identifiable charactersboth of those films are enjoyable unique and eclectic in their own little way but really for me fail to make an impact when compared to the sheer rush of pure adrenaline presented to us by la femme is not only a fascinating story about a woman coming to terms with the end of her life and she once knew it but is also a perfectly rendered drama dealing with the emotional and psychological implications created by her newlyacquired double life besson perfectly juxtaposes the sweetnatured and likable and her relationship with the amiable marco jeanhughes anglade with the cold and calculating assassin who thinks nothing of executing her target for the exchange of cold hard cash its also an impressive action film one that drips with the cool french chic of subway or le grand bleu 1988 creating an interesting and exotic approach to the scenes of violence and gunplay that would echo through to the subsequent lon as well as bessons later sciencefiction piece the fifth element 1997another interesting factor is the possible relationship between and matilda from lon with the potential future scenario for matilda echoing the present situation of here i wouldnt necessarily recommend viewing this as a prequel in any sense of the word however it does present an interesting duality between the two films that is further suggested by the character of the cleaner here played effortlessly by the aforementioned jean reno ultimately though la femme is about pure entertainment taking an interesting story some fine performances and bessons unique stylistic flair especially when it comes to capturing scenes of blistering action and blending them together to produce a film that delivers on all fronts unlike his earlier films le dernier combat subway and le grande bleu the excessive use of style and occasional stabs of humour are here applied to a rich and rewarding plot and a collection of characters that are interesting intelligent and above all else believable for me la femme was bessons first truly great film and one that still to this day could and should be evaluated alongside his other great works specifically lon the fifth element and the recent angela 2005,intelligence
one of the hallmarks of a good european film is that it gets to be remade in hollywood directorproducerwriter luc besson has received this dubious honour twice firstly with a remake of and more recently with one of taxii cant comment on the american version of taxi but the remake of known as point of no return or the assassin isnt a patch on the original made me feel sympathy for the central characters to the extent that i was almost in tears at times the story is a simple one of love and longing to be free interspersed with bessons trademark economicalyetbloody action scenesproves that there is more to cinema than hollywood,intelligence
luc besson has been behind some of the most provocative and intriguing action films of the last 15 years and his introduction to mainstream american cinemagoers began with 1991s la femme beginning with a drug store shootout that leaves three junkie punkers and a few policemen dead this film is rapidly engaging and shows off bessons violent chic in the fray only young anne parillaud survives after offing a policeman who had let his guard down at a crucial moment facing certain death in frances court of law she is given two choices lethal injection or have her execution faked and then assume a new life as a female superassassinspy a wildraised feral child of sorts had picked up certain skills on the street that eventually prove to be quite valuable to her government handlers as she makes things difficult for them and especially her chief mentor bob tcheky karyo no secret is made of his affections for her but he tries to mold into a valuable person and hes able to do it with the help of another agent played by actress jeanne moreau who teaches her the finer ways of womanhood by the end of her training has been modeled into a fine sexy female assassin besson makes no attempts to sacrifice his film in the ways of hollywood convention and he proves that the days of femaledriven action cinema are not yet dead parillaud is compelling as at first she almost seems unaware of her identity as a woman when she isnt taking out highpowered political officials shes romancing a kind and gentle shop clerk who falls madly in love with her as she does with him lastly la femme has some of the most stylized and violent action scenes of any movie ive seen in a while luc besson with this film and much of his subsequent work has proved he is one of cinemas most valuable personalities on the european asian and american action film circuits also be aware of a cameo by future besson leon 1994 star jean reno as victor the cleaner in what is pretty much an early prototype of his role from that starmaking breakthrough film810,intelligence
this movie is simply an action movie classic and also one of bessons best ingenious script is supported by wonderful actors and full of classic dialogs some of the scenes and characters were also borrowed by qt in his classic pulp fiction the most outstanding is probably the example of victor the cleaner who was the predecessor of wolf in pulp fiction and also for leon in another bessons classic it is also one of the films which opened the discussion about the violence in moviesif you havent seen it yet and you are a fan of intelligent actionpsychological drama be sure not to miss it,intelligence
on paper doesnt sound to promising in the wrong hands the idea of a criminal being trained to become a top assassin sounds like a story that would be campy ridiculous and overthetop almost comic book like luckily was in the right hands as the end result is way better than expected the script is well written the cinematography is beautiful and the directing is exciting more often than not that said what ultimately makes work as well as it does is lead anne parillaud as parillaud doesnt have much dialogue in the first act this leaves her to do most of her acting with facial expressions with a lesser actress this could have been disastrous however parillaud is a strong actress and is able to pull the role off well perhaps it is due to her lack of dialogue that i find the first half of the picture far superior to the second halfonce s relationship with marco begins the film loses the same momentum it once had this shift in tone is necessary to some extent in order to show is able to love and be human at the same time the result makes the film feel a bit uneven the romancefilled middle almost feels like it belongs in another movie altogether the romance is helped by the good performances but the tone isnt quite right its a problem that probably could have been fixed in the editing process it would be fascinating to see another cut of one where the romance is drastically edited with scenes rearranged and maybe a few minutes taken out for me that would be a better version im sure there are people who find the romantic segments the best part of i am not one of themthere was never a sequel to but the ending leaves room for one obviously too much time has gone by for a sequel to be made now though i can picture one that begins right as ends the perfect ending provides enough closure for the audience to be satisfied and just enough room for more the ending is often the most important part in any storytelling medium be it literature theater or film the wrong ending can leave an audience frustrated the wrong ending can even ruin the entire experience for an audience with luc besson has given the audience the most suitable ending one that is completely satisfying may not be perfect though the material in the beginning and the end is so strong that only middle section prevents it from being a perfect movie,intelligence
young anne parillaud commits robbery with her pals while on drugs and she kills a police officer instead of being put on trial she is discovered by a special agent named bob tcheky karyo and introduced to a special training school bob thinks she has the gift of becoming an assassinspy  working for the government at first remains funloving but when she realises that it is a choice between training or death she has to conform eventually she completes the secret training and on her birthday bob takes her out for dinner and gives her a birthday present her first victimback to the outside world has a new identity now and she falls in love with marco jeanhughes anglade a supermarket cashier they get married and start a happy life together but soon finds out that she is to be haunted by her missions forever in a task that is about to fail has no way to go and her life is in danger as well as everything elsei think it is a good idea that the film does not mark two years later or anything like that as s training progressesas you would realise it simultaneously the intensity between marco and bob is well expressed the love of and marco is tender and aching marco is portrayed as a loving compassionate husband the action and suspense in the film hold your breath point of no return the hollywood remake starring bridget fonda is a pathetic remake and there is no comparison between and point of no return if you have seen neither i recommend you to see this one only,intelligence
how could i have enjoyed 20 years back i was much younger and i was only beginning to get interested in movies so all the tricks workedbesson makes movies for teenagers like him for adults who refuse to grow up not because the adult world is too complex and dangerous and hell never again be a naive young boy that is spielbergs nostalgic stance but because he is stubborn and intellectually challenged its a tough world out there but i dont care because i was always this child living within his fantasies and he never grew up and got a lot of success and made a lot of money got to live with beautiful s and got respect from powerful peoplelooks so fake today nothing rings right the look is so 80s the characters so flimsy the opening sequence is ridiculous and then the continuity is only based on poor little screaming this lack of substance rapidly becomes annoying even more so as tcheky karyo reads his scarce lines with jean reno he is the kind of strongfaced and dumb actor a poormans clint eastwood who kills without a wink but is so fragile inside ahah the typical besson herowas much hyped for its visual prowess well theres really a nice surreal  futuristic look in the settings but the directing skills only make the script appear more dumb and vain besson has always made movies for teenagers and this is a good business he is a smart businessman with a visual eye but no more skilled than a videoclip director and none of his movies will stand the test of time,intelligence
after seeing point of no return a great movie and being told that the original was better i was certainly thrilled to see that one of the indie film channels was running la femme then i saw the movie ouch this was a major letdownherself reminds me of jar jar binks more than any other character ive seen recently she comes across entirely as comic relief the movie simply has nothing to recommend it besides the core concept of an evil inhuman character paradoxically learning to be human while training as an assassin and that concept failed miserably in due to the poor writing of the title role,intelligence
remade and rehashed several times over the 1990s its easy to forget just how good luc bessons 1989 original is the action sequences most notably the restaurant shootout and the opening heist are absolutely electric but also very brutalanne parillaud won the cesar for her performance as the title character and its easy to see why she is utterly convincing whatever she is playing as a junkie she looks and acts like she was pulled out of a cardboard box on a street corner but then looks utterly in control with a big gun when ordered to assassinateadding to parillauds excellence is the first class support cast tckeky karyo as her sadistic mentor jean hugues anglade as her boyfriend and french cinematic legend jeanne moreau as the stylist to the french secret service theres also a fantastic cameo from jean reno as the cleaner a little prelude to leon perhaps its hard to see why they had to remake this movie after all its pretty americanized theres even a training montage and aside from a few hairdos and s mobile phone it hasnt really dated seventeen years on it still looks cool definitely one of bessons best,intelligence
this movie put director luc besson into the big leaguethe basic story is about a drugged up vicious street punk serving a life sentence for killing a copshe is given a second chance at freedom of sorts by a top secret french assassination agencythe movie shows her transformation into something better then she was and the affect it has on the two men in her life that mean something to herthis movie is amazingly well acted anne parillaud marc duret patrick fontana are outstandingthis is a pretty violent movie but not just for the sake of violenceit is a necessary counterpoint to nikkitas blossoming appreciation of lifethe violence is realistic and well donethe action scenes are fast pasted and tenseeverything about this film is top notch i recommend it,intelligence
thats the way it is in the stonecold world of undercover assassinations at least thats what they tell me this was and still is a great movie about a druggedup and punkedout french who murders people without hesitation she gets busted tried and convicted and is faced with spending nearly most of the remainder of her life in prison but then mysterious dark elements of a secret french organization get a hold of her and  by way of making her an offer that the devil himself would have been proud of  she consents to be turned into a sexy sophisticated lady who murders people without hesitation all under state protection vacations included the wonders of pleabargainingi first saw this movie shortly after it was released on video wish i could have seen it on the big screen  i bet it rocked especially that awesome gun battle scene in the restaurant  s first hit i have watched it several more times over the years and it still holds up pretty well although i am amazed that i like the movie at all because it has many elements in it that ordinarily would loudly signify bad movie to me such asnamely the lead characters and bob played by anne parrilaud and tcheky karyo arent even likeable i mean they are after all coldblooded professional killers and bob  get a shave secondly the whole setup seems so implausible what with some sort of underground assassin factory cranking out killers who roam around europe yeah okay next youll want to sell me oceanfront property in kansas and the more i watch this film the more some of the plot holes get too big for comfort like for example the boyfriend rico never once has any physical contact with the workplace hospital that serves as s cover most boyfriends i think wouldnt for so long be so out of the loop about where their friends workbut these negative elements pale when set against the overall bigger picture that the movie presents its sort of like the whole being greater than the sum of its parts mainly because despite the characters flaws and obvious plot weaknesses you somehow end up being completely swept up into the story and caring deeply about all the players they all seem so recognizably troubled not just because of what they do for a living but because they are after all human beings i mean they dont just want to shoot someone they also want to reach out and touch someone hey can we get a big group hug here  assassins includedanyway it was and still is a great movie i only hope it gets rereleased for a theatrical showing someday soon so i can watch it in a bigscreen format,intelligence
after years of knowing the hype of this pic i finally decided to view it director luc besson had been responsible for one of my favorite movies of all time leon the professional so it had to be good right not it was one of the most boring and unintelligible few hours of absolute tripe i have ever seenfirstly the character of or marie or josephine take your pick is rather annoying and seems a hysterical split personality one moment laughing and dancing the next crying and screaming the next composed and coldblooded anne parillaud does a really poor job as the title character and has the screen presence of a stick her handler played by tcheky karyo interacts poorly with her and everyone else in the movie he seems to be modeling stylish european suitsher jobs of killing are all idiotic and absurdly farfetched but worse none seem to make any basic practical sense the worst is the last which has dressing as a male diplomat to penetrate a fortified embassy with the criminallooking jean renot one can suspend disbelief just so far but this action was unintentionally comicalif you must see this crap due to its rep be prepared to have difficulty staying awake and avoiding laughing a truly poor effort all around made even worse by being in french with subtitles,intelligence
this s too thinunlike the as in former ussr premier and like its leading lady la femme is too thin to be as fully satisfying or thought provoking as it could have been  as written by luc besson and as played by anne parillaud  is a whiney drug addicted psychopath who murders a police officer in cold blood even though she has virtually no chance of escape even during incarceration ruthlessly maims an interrogator   she is sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 30 yearscaution  spoilers aheadwhen finds herself  being summarily executed by lethal injection she cries out for her mama this cowardly behavior was found repugnant in the days of cagney and bogart here i suppose it is suppose to arouse sympathy for  it doesnt workawakes to find that her execution and burial has been staged and her new mentor bob tchky karyo recruits her  for work as a spy  assasin  bob gives her one hour to choose  either work for us or be executed for realusing a ruse attacks bob and taking his weapon uses bob as a shield in an attempt to escape when her plans are foiled attempts suicide but bob has left the first chamber in his gun empty  reclaiming his weapon bob shoots in the leg as a lesson this is the first scene in the movie i actually enjoyedentering training the cruel unruly physically injures one trainer and emotionally injures another bob finds out from it is her twentieth birthday  bringing a cake he tells her she has two weeks or shell never see 21 visiting her feminity instructor jeanne moreau begins to learn to use her feminine gifts  after finishing her makeup throughout which moreau says you are going to be very late goes to celebrate her twentythird  birthday with bob after three years the only apparent changes in are that she is slightly calmer ritalin and has learn to brush her teeth comb her hair and apply makeup your tax francs at workher birthday celebration outside the facility which she hasnt left in three years turns out to be an assassination in a public restaurant this is the best action sequence in the movie and parillaud performs many of her own stunts  however it seems pretty silly for an expert spy to leave a novice spy to commit this kind of mayhem in such a public placeit gets worse  once escapes and returns to the spy compound making no attempt to hide her tracks bob tells her that she is free and that the organization has set her up with a cover  right she has just slaughtered over a half dozen people in a public place and she is free to go settle down  what is there no police force in france i guess killed the last cop in the beginning  then becomes domesticated and settles in with a sweet boyfriend marco jeanhugues anglade  things are going swimmingly for until the nasty organization asks her to do a few more jobs each one more ridiculous than the rest  one asks us believe that could shoot a woman with a high powered rifle from her motel room and have no police come to investigate  the last would have us believe that dressed as as a male diplomat could ride through the gates of an embassy with a heavily armed hit man whom looks nothing like the real ambassadors driver without being questioned  it also asks us to believe a car can crash through a solid brick wall and keep on goingnear the end of the movie marco whom has discovered whom is debates with bob about the moral equivalency of s assassinations of enemies of the state with her murder of the innocent cop  some have argued this movie makes a strong statement against capital punishment  i disagree may no longer be as rebellious but she is every bit as dangerous at the end of the movie as she was at the beginning  she never shows remorse for the cops murder and always seems only concerned about saving her own skin  her only sacrifice seems to be abandoning the two men she loves will again become the foul ruthless drugaddicted wild child of the streets  the liberal conceit that society made her that way and that love and financial security will save her fails to take into account the robert downey juniors and oj simpsons of the world certainly external forces do shape us but they dont make us whom we are  that kind of woolyheaded thinking is why so many favor capital punishment  that is in order to prevent nitwit social scientists from inflicting the same murderer on us twice  besides the organization would track down and kill to protect itself from exposure  would understand  after all the organization would be playing by her rulesthis movie is wrong headed from the start  luc bessons trademark flying dolly opening shot into strutting drugaddicted criminals does not work here  drug addicts particularly those planning to rob a store would skulk not strut  thin stuff indeed,intelligence
after killing a cop and maiming others a drugaddicted nut case is inexplicably trained to work as an assassin for the police nothing about this idiotic movie makes sense why isnt a cop killer punished why do the police pick such an unstable person to work for them why are the police in the assassination business parillaud turns in a surly performance in the title role a character about as interesting as a wet rag she veers from coldblooded killer to whiny crybaby to giggling schoolbut no attempt is made to explain her bizarre behavior s missions are executed so poorly that they are laughable theres a dull romance with a grocery store cashier,intelligence

who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation when people ask who we are what do we say what is our name occupation maybe we mention some hobbies but what if they ask no but really who are you most people become lost what do you mean who am i i told you my name and occupation but i dont think our name shows truly who we are i mean there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different so what makes our identity the main character is also faced with this question after her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training that means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins so she has to create herself all over again she has to follow certain rules act in certain ways only to pass of course at some point she is forced to change she cant tell anyone what she does not even her name and that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer worldso what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury well you become secretive you have something like an identity crisis you think you know who you are other people think they know who you are but those two do not match and sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she isall of us want to be different remembered we have our identity and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us what would we become constant actors or chameleons i believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system it shows quick change is needed to adapt to create new identity i believe it is impossible to be without identity even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity i guess its in our nature we have to show to the world this is who we are,intelligence

although this movie has a few shortcomings particularly in the beginning i really liked it anne paillard and tcheky karyo gave brilliant performances the artful way the movie mixed thrilling espionage scenes with warm human emotional scenes is a testament to luc bessons talent as a directorcritics cite besson as a pivotal figure in the cinma du look movement a specific highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s subway the big blue and are all considered to be of this stylistic school the term was coined in a 1989 essay in la revue du cinema n 449 by raphal bassan in which besson was lumped with two other directors who shared le look these directors were said to favor style over substance spectacle over narrativemost of the filmmakers in the category including besson squirmed uncomfortably at being labeled particularly in light of their forebears frances new wave jeanluc godard and franois truffaut were rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most avantgarde medium at the time said besson in the new york times today the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better more convincing and pleasurable to watchbecause its becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work he added in this same interview i think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the moviemaking establishmentbesson is working on a film called the lady original title dans la lumiere due to be released in the fall of 2011 he is also working on lockout due to be released in april 2012 he is also coproducer of a film called colombiana also scheduled to be released in august 2011,intelligence
parillaud delivers a breakthrough performance as the title character a convicted murderer whom the government gives a second chance in exchange for using her as an assassin and spy the action scenes are memorable and topnotch its hard to know whether to like or dislike the characters since theyre not quite threedimensional enough to feel something for nor are they that unlikable to despise the romance may be appropriate to establish feeling but the characters interaction with each other seems dry and lacks chemistry jean reno is extremely underused as victor the cleaner very stylish to say the least and is a good enough film to make the mustsee lists of anyone who likes action andor foreign films remade as black cat in hong kong and point of no return in the usa out of four,intelligence
a triumph of style over substance underdeveloped characters do things that are predictably unpredictable and the viewer is left detached uninvested in the emotionally unengaging story of an annoying and unconvincing protagonist you dont watch her relationships develop the film just presents you with them and expects you to be charmed theres far too much irritating cookiness its really not very good,intelligence
i loved this movie on many levels others have tried to copy its formulae but bessons original creation is a master piece of brilliant visual aspects direction and story lineone cant help noticing the colours of scenes how they appear neutral yet the characters stand out of the screenexcellent shot where besson uses the camera as thecourse of the bullet in the kitchen battle sceneits with visuals like this that captures the imagination,intelligence
i cant recall whether i last saw this in the cinema or on video but i do recall liking it a lot and even had a poster on my wall coming to it again almost 30 years later i am not quite as impressed it stuck me as overlong and i found it a bit uneven there were scenes i was supposed to take seriously and then there were ridiculous sequences with cars ploughing through walls and fightouts in posh restaurant kitchens with automatic weapons i should have been on a warning with the opening sequence when there is a super hero comic book response by the police to a potential chemist shop robbery then of course during the period between viewings i have seen television adaptations the fabulous french canadian version la femme with the stunning peta wilson and the more recent and more similar to this in tone us with maggie q the french canadian version very much takes the theme set out here but builds on it imaginatively and believably it has to be said that even if this original film does now disappoint it was a great concept and luc lesson can take much of the credit for that,intelligence
anne parillaud stars in the title role a dangerous street punk who shoots a cop during a botched pharmacy robbery she ends up saved from her execution by a typically shadowy government organization because a character named bob tcheky karyo has seen potential in her shes groomed to be an assassin and eventually adapts to this new life of hers adding to her newfound happiness is a romance with a nice guy supermarket cashier marco jeanhugues angladela femme may surprise you if youre seeing it for the first time having spawned an american remake point of no return and a cable tv series one might think it were wall to wall action but its not its actually got quite a bit of humanity working as a straight drama for the most part with interludes of intrigue it benefits from engaging characters as blossoms the character becomes more and more appealing anglade is a likable worthy love interest adding to the good vibesthat doesnt mean however that theres no action at all one set piece in a restaurant will capture the viewers attention as things go from bad to worse and gets caught in a shootout there is some potent violence to enjoy and giving the proceedings a real shot in the arm is the latein thegame appearance of evercool jean reno who plays an unhinged cleaner named victorthe sexy parillaud is convincing every step of the way the excellent karyo does a compelling job as this unlikely new sort of father figure in her life film legend jeanne moreau adds a great touch of class as amande who coaches on how to bring out her femininitythe breakthrough film for its writer  director luc besson might be too slow and quiet for some tastes but it does have style besson would later reteam with reno for his american debut leon the professionalseven out of 10,intelligence
when the film opens is a frail young woman whos literally dragged to a robbery everyone is excited but she seems absent hanging on the miserable hope to get her fix when everything goes wrong and thats an understatement she is sitting on the ground passively watching cops and punks kill and being killed at that point she seems like a victim but then she coldbloodily shoots a cop who actually cared for her then even for us shes beyond any kind of redemption things go rather quickly shes arrested put on trial and sentenced for perpetuitybut theres something in anne parillauds performance that won the french oscar for best actress the only award the film received that turns into a genuinely enigmatic personality we dont like her theres not much question that shes a bad woman but shes also a weird infantile grotesque rude and excessively unpredictable person the film doesnt suggest that shes victim of herself but simply that theres a sort of vacuum in her life her education or her mind that let criminal impulses fill it shes bad but in an accidental sort of way the film then ventures in realistic fantasy when shes put to sleep by injection and wakes up in a secret government organization specialized in recruiting new profiles for assignments to kill what did they see in we never know but the man in charge of her reeducation is bob played by the great tcheky karyo and hes convinced that the has potentialluc besson knows his craft he expected that the whole first act would consist on showing the evolution of from that sorryexcuseforawoman to a professional female killer meaning in subtext that shell have to become a woman as well its a rebirth a metamorphosis shell owe to her new job and what an irony that killing people will be the counterpart to being alive this paradox will shape the second personality of wholl never stop to be a tortured woman but in a different way shes just starting to enjoy life but the catch of her redemption consists on coldblooded murders but besson knows our disbelief wont be suspended for long if the change isnt believable we could believe his leon was such a pro because we didnt see his backstory or his training for the film will have to become a characterstudy and i guess this is why besson started with an action sequence and some unexpected outburst during the training parts unpredictability is the key to her appeal as an original character until we know its time to get over it but it allows besson to find the right balance between action and drama and some moments like the interactions with jeanne moreau teaching her how to smile how to be a woman is one of these emotional reliefs the story asks for and it turns out that because her life is still at stakes because shes supposed to be dead and shes easily disposable she becomes a real woman feminine pretty and gentle and then something interesting happens theres a transfer from to the script in the unpredictability department remains the same woman vulnerable and melancholic and the excitement the thrills come from bessons hardedged script yes he is an expert of cinema du look as they say in france and yes he was one of these new talents with vision but he doesnt get enough credit for his screen writing her relationship with pygmalion bob is one of the aspects that elevate the filmi will not reveal all the film but theres just one scene that works on a perfect tertiary tempo and its just fascinating is invited to a restaurant with bob to celebrate her graduation her gift is wrapped in a box she opens it and her smile vanishes its a gun she must kill someone first surprise she has three minutes to do it after bob leaves no time to think second surprise shes suppose to get off from a little window located in mens toilets when she gets there its walled third surprise each time we see nothing coming were literally put in her highheel shoes and try to figure out how shell get from that situation the action sequences that go after are spectacular but traditional yet it works because besson makes his action sequences as a dressing not as a meal the film is a terrific thriller because of the setups rather than the outcomes the anticipation rather than the action especially since isnt exactly the leonprofessional type the film almost works on a hitchcockian leveland it could have worked alone with bob and the missions but besson adds a third dimension a romance falls in love with a gentle and smiling cashier played by jeanhugues anglade hes obviously not expecting such a beauty to approach him but she does maybe because shes like him she feels like an outcast and she could tell he would love her the organization reeducated her but there was still a little void in her heart and i just love how the film never tries to create artificial obstacles in their love its pure passionate love and it will overlap with the killing missions in the most creative and again unexpected ways thats exactly what i love about the film it provides unexpected moments of thrills and emotions without being too original its a good thriller romance and characterstudyand trust besson to always find a way to surprise you every

in the 1990s director luc besson was on a tear in his native france as he paved the way with four very successful commercial films that year including the iconic leon the professional the fifth element joan of arc and this one the one that started it all la femme even though leon the professional is the best of the foursome theyre all very worthy in terms of quality in the case of la femme we need to realize that even though many situations are deemed implausible and to just sit back and enjoy some jawdropping action that will likely leave you in shock until the final credits rollanne parillaud stars as a rebellious drugaddicted teen who hangs around with the wrong crowd one night these miscreants decide to rob a pharmacy in which one of the members father owns the store when the ownerfather arrives on the scene with a gun and notices his son and his friends stealing items in the store things start to get real ugly the father is shot to death and the police arrive on the scene where a standoff takes shape the gang is all shot dead with the exception of who surprisingly blows away a cop who was trying to revive heris now incarcerated for life while serving her time is manipulated by her captors that she was contemplating suicide by a tranquilizer overdose when she awakens she is greeted by sharp clad man named bob tcheky karyo and offers her an ultimatum she is now under the care of the dsge she can either be an assassin or go by way of row 8 plot 30 her grave she chooses to become an assassin and has excelled in the craft quite impressively she even becomes computer savvy skilled in martial arts and weaponry and even appears quite like a businesswoman like in appearance after fulfilling her first missions she is transferred to paris as an enforcer to when the dsge needs her while in paris she meets a guy named marco jeanhughes anglade and they start a relationship with him oblivious as to what her profession is marco is puzzled as to why she has no family friends or any kind of connection whatsoever bob gets invited to dinner as poses as her uncle bob and offers them two tickets to venice italy as an engagement giftbut the trip and the moment of happiness comes to an end when receives a call about going on a mission with a sniper rifle in the bathroom there she kills a woman and leaves her disappointedthe film ends when someone named the cleaner jean reno who was sent to destroy all the evidence which at cost leaves him wounded by the embassy guards and gets killed while trying to escape from them marco eventually knows about her secret life and that draws concerns over her psychological scars he decides that whats best for her is to vanish forever feeling that she abandoned the dsge bob and marco discuss whats in store for her they agree she will be missedwith the exception of the rushed conclusion this is an otherwise exciting start to the expectations of bessons other commercial films especially leon the professional i guess at the time besson was still trying to master his craft as a filmmaker and though even if the pacing was contrived at times the setpieces were still something quite noteworthy s induction hit the assassination mission in italy plus every scene featuring the cleaner are primary examples of how dynamic besson really is the cleaner is one of the coolest characters in this movie and make no mistake about it he was the inspiration to the character wolf from quinton tarantinos pulp fiction who was played by harvey keitel after keitel played the cleaner in the american 1993 remake in leon the professional leon is believed to be a distant cousin to the cleanerthe movie itself spawned many remakes and imitators over the past couple of decades john badham directed a pretty decent remake titled point of no return with bridget fonda playing whos name was changed to maggie in canada joel surnow directed a tv series starring peta wilson in the lead that lasted for five seasons 19972001 and warner brothers distributed a television series starring maggie q in the as she defected from her employment from the agency is now plotting to bring them downthe movie here was quite stimulating bessons direction was well executed but the performances were quite memorable parillaud was cesar winner for performance and karyo was very convincing as bob but the finale was way too hurried it might leave one demanding for a sequel otherwise it is a bit of a letdownoverall i recommend this film with the exception of a poorly hurried finale that was anticlimactic but the action and the performances are truly one youll likely treasure for those who love action films and s with guns youre in for a real treat,intelligence
it opens with a burst of violence as a handful of parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights theres a shoot out when the police arrive shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade the bodies pile up shot to shreds anne parillaud a gang moll senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme the editing is quick the air filled with curses the colors garish in other words its an imitation of an american action movieit was remade in 1993 as point of no return with bridget fonda in the starring role of the druggedout psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin lets see  that would make the later production an american imitation of a french imitation of an american action movie a few shots are identical bridget fonda is cuter than anne parillaud and sexier too but shes not nearly parillauds equal as an expressive actress watch parillauds infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restauranttheres quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most american action films of the 80s after that initial shoot out deaths tend to take place in singles not in grand slams released from the institute or whatever the agency is called and only drafted for occasional special killings parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom she has an affair with jeanhugues anglade an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face this generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru tchky karyo who has developed a subdued yen for her but its just as well he doesnt get her he has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front endi dont know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view parillaud is a real beast at the beginning a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor she beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out she breaks into wild dances for no reason i would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking they need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown however the frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside downjeanne moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts my god what a face its made for the camera she was never a hollywoodgorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic same with jean reno who shows up at a botched murder as the cleanup man there have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if i see any more ill start to think they existthis movie is a longie at one hour and fiftyseven minutes but its not slow the sets are perfectly done from grand to ruined the acting is professional throughout the camera doesnt wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that its possible to tell who is doing what to whomworth catching if its on,intelligence

 lets get the basics out of the way first is a good film with all of the visual flourishes and compelling mood that it seems can be found in the bulk of bessons work if you are coming to this review before having seen leon the professional then my best advice is just to disregard the rest of what follows and take on its own terms hope you enjoy it comparison with leon  risk of spoilers for both films  i know there is some debate amongst film fans over which constitutes the most satisfying experience personally id have to pick leon disregarding the sex of the character leon as an enterprise is like a more plush version of bessons 1990 assassin effort its like a before and after snapshot leons pretty much compartmentalized his life  s struggling to get a grip on hersperhaps leon represents the evolution of bessons paternal instinct as he watches his own children grow there is certainly a greater degree of patience shown from outside influences in mathildas case as opposed to the original street kid is the quintessential animal and although we are shown what instigates her partial transformation her support system is never quite as convincingly solid as that provided by leon and tonyi suppose the tension bubbling under the surface does provide a comedic highlight as marco lies dreamily on the bed and coos to his supposedly docile mate that he didnt know what hed come across when he first met her  cut to our heroine assembling a gun in the bathroom guess what mate you still dont  having more rounded characters with less rough edges did make it easier for me to become emotionally involved though would leon have opened the door for mathilda if he hadnt been schooled by someone with perhaps similar thought processes to bob in leon we see the individual that would like to become by obtaining her freedomthose who prefer to dispassionately study people and their actions from a distance might just retain a softer spot for its certainly interesting to speculate on what motivated the changes in his later work though ,intelligence
leon the professional done by the same director is my favourite movie of all time so i had high hopes for this flick butthis is utter dreck nothing in this movie makes any sense dozens of questions are never answered eg why is the name isnt used for 90 of the movie even though the film is named after it executed why does she have to learn art and dancing in order to become an assassin why cant she all of a sudden bear killing people anymore when she never cared before at all why doesnt she try to quit the assassinating business why does cry all the time who is she working for heaven hell why does she leave her fiance in the end nothing makes any sense and the corruption scene which is completely redundant in the course of the movie is the most repugnant ive seen in some time the quintessence of this dreck scene is woman should be mens plaything i honestly did not expect such tripe from luc besson who wrote the divine leon the professional the soundtrack is the single worst ive heard in my life you can find better music in porn movies save for the few scenes that had leonlike music all in all this could have been a good movie if certain things would be more developed like s sadness and anger certain scenes cut the whole soundtrack replaced and an alternative ending filmed but as it is the movie cannot be saved by a fan edit so i will never watch this again shame on you luc besson,intelligence
its hard to see as a movie in its own right since it seems so much like a dress rehearsal for the superior leon the camera angles are the same the look of the movie is the same the music is the same it even features jean reno as victor a cleaner who kills indiscriminately like an early prototype of leon himselfbut falls down where leon flew high on two counts acting and script anne parillaud is shouty and annoying at the start and screechy and annoying at the end and shes only just about likeable in the middle luckily everyone else acts pretty much without emotion which suits the blank sterile look of most of the filmand the script is just ridiculous it seems the french government sometimes give promising criminals a second chance by officially killing them but really training them to be secret agents and of course psychotic rebellious drug addict is just the kind of person whod be good for that purpose isnt she well of course she is eventually after a few months of ultracool action sequences is given a toppriority mission involving some documents from an embassy but it all goes wrong in the endone problem is that the script disorients time we see weeks of being disruptful during her training until on her 20th birthday she is told that if she doesnt shape up they will have to kill her after all in the blink of the cameras eye its now her 23rd birthday in one scene she goes to bed with the supermarket cashier in the next she wakes up six months later without so much as a word of warning i dont want films to start telling us every little minute detail but a little bit of help wouldnt go amissdespite these gripes it has to be said that some of the action scenes are brilliant particularly the test in the restaurant and the sniper scene in the bathroom but even these seem like a warmup of scenes featured in leon a few years later maybe the correct way to put it is to say that leon is a ripoff of but that doesnt stop from being way inferior of the two,intelligence
writer  director luc bessons crime thriller la femme served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre before bessons seminal assassination saga hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts you dont have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television hollywood remade la femme in 1993 as point of no return with bridget fonda in the lead role and director john badham at the helm later two cable television series followed first came la femme with peta wilson from 1997 to 2001 and maggie q appeared second in in 2010 along the way besson made colombiana and countless other clones of la femme have ensued believe it or not this was anne parillauds breakout role and she won the french oscar for her spirited performance as memorable as parillaud is as the heroine jean reno makes an unforgettable impression as victor the cleaner who mops up the blood gore and bodies after a gunfight la femme qualifies as an exciting shootem up with bessons slick touches snappy dialogue and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time he exploits his parisian and italian locations with an eye to exotic settings thierry arbogasts lowangle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer eric serras brooding orchestral score ultimately la femme delivers more than knockdead action and memorable characters ironically the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible intelligent and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her antisocial murderous disposition this makes la femme a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins,intelligence

this movie is a very good movie with an interesting story and characters you get drawn into the characters motivations and the movie leaves you with wanting more there is one small problem with the movie however near the end when the cleaner is brought in you are left wondering what the the purpose of this was was it to cover bobs attempt to enable maries escape or was it because they cut something out of the movie it is really never explained satisfactorily in the movie other than that the movie is good,intelligence

stylish thriller hardly this french action film from director luc besson is more confused and unsure about itself than anything else i have seen recentlythe opening action sequence shows some promise and the following action sequences are good however they are sadly too few and far between the drama is dull and erratic and the characters are generally unlikeable anne parillaud and the support cast are unable to involve the audience emotionallyla femme ends up more like a try hard bgrade action thriller very averagesaturday april 28 1991  balwyn cinema,intelligence
hollywood made the same mistake with shall we dance you take a good foreign movie add a bunch of big name hollywood stars and increase the budget by 50 and in the end you get a flop that is not as good as the original while fonda did a good job as the in point of no return it is anne parillaud that clearly gives the better performance while point of no return is an action film is not at times the movie has its action scenes but overall this is a drama and a love story not an action  adventure film the difference that both movies have the language the cast of actors the ending make both movies almost completely different point of no return is a movie where the actions speak louder than its words while uses there words as its actions you can have a love story without having to say i love you in it is the story of a woman reborn while point of no return has the same storyline as it lacks the true grit that made the original great,intelligence
spoilersspoilersspoilersspoilersfirstly i must congratulate luc besson the fifth element on his superb directorial work also the part of is exceedingly well played also the scene where she wakes up and asks am i in heaven anyway is a 19 year old junkie who robs a chemists with protecting guns and shoots a cop by putting the gun to his head and walking out is also the best action film of the 90s and beyond only eclipsed by the japanese cinema film ying huang boon sik a better tomorrow  trains to be a government agent and falls in love with the guy at the supermarket  that is all very cool but the last line is because i love only you which is fine but how can you make a series on how the film ends anyway is a masterpiece see stroke of genius fantasticone of the very best films ever  ,intelligence

this may be one of the best films i have ever seen  it provides thrills and style but contains haunting psychological aspects too  it is an example of excellent character development  the main character is frightening in some scenes and endearing in others the lead actress gives a stunningly good performance  every actor is great no matter how small the role  every character is a threedimensional one  begins as a tough unfeeling street punk  she remains tough throughout the film but at the same time she is a tender passionate soul  i loved the romance story it was sweet but realistic  a brilliant simply brilliant film,intelligence
is a masculine name such as hrushczov why didnt the film creators check whether such a female name exists   i also agree with other commentators that sudden time jumps 3 year then 12 year deserve a warning in other films one put a phrase such as three years later  with these minor problems it is an unforgettable film,intelligence
first of all im a complete fan of bessons work and not because im frenchwhat can we say about that movie well theres only one thingexcellent the cast is brilliantanne parillaud is incredibly sensitive jean reno is as usualexplosive and of course besson really knows how to use a camera a movie to be seen,intelligence
i get really speechless when it comes to talk about this movie if you see my list of comments you can picture that i love bessons work is no exception i saw this one with anticipation and it was the last one i saw from his whole work i read some reviews and the good words about it excited me even more the result when i saw it was pure bliss this one has it all  laughs tears action romance you name it and the greatest part is that this one is really french even in its language which gives it a much more european look and feel this movie was also surprising for the change of pace and style for besson remember that his last movie was an poethic underwater chronicle which in comparison to this one was a fairy tale this movie would also spread the roots for one of bessons greatest and universally aclaimed movies lon i loved it till the end of the rolling end titles to the sound of eric serra who writes for this movie on of his most characteristic and beautiful dramatic scores i love it and i will keep on loving it hoping that more and more people see this movie which i have no doubt marked a revolution in french cinema,intelligence
as my above summary indicates my feelings for this film are positiveexcept for the ending like most french films ive seen the plot goes faster and faster until the end where youll be left saying thats it anyway anne parillaud plays a drugged out criminal who is given a chance to reform and become a secret agent for the french government the government officer who she trains under is simply known as bob who is beautifully played by tcheky kuryo when is released after a grueling preparation she meets and falls in love with rico played by marc duret their tranquil romance is soon spoiled however when she is called into service as an assasain     there were some things that i found could have been omitted from this film because they served no artistic purpose like when she gives the mouse to her computer teacher  my only guess is that was to show how incredibly off the wall this character was and to further differentiate between her at twenty and her at twentythree there has also been some dispute over the graphic killing of the policeman at the beginning of the film but a complete junkie who just saw all her friends got killed would probably do such a thing needless to say if you dont like blood you wont like this movie     one thing i am not ambivalent about is the acting every single one of these actors carries their role off to a t kuryo completely and believably switches from the hard and stoic trainer to tender and loving when he is with duret plays with complete natural ease and parillaud shows such depth in her acting its scary     after that longwinded review i dont really have anything else to say except this movie was one of the best action flicks i have seen in a while the acting was wonderful and the plot was good despite a very contrasting subtle ending 8510 feel free to email me with your thoughts or arguments,intelligence
i first saw back in 1992 at the movies i have to say that i lost all interest once we see the druggedup punkwonderfully played by bessons wifeanne parillaud coldbloodedly kill a cop begging for mercyeven though she is sentenced to 30 years in prison and is then secretly executed we see her reborn as a government agent and even though we get to witness the slow metamorphasis from a 19yr old nihilist to a 23 year old professional killer i still couldnt feel any sympathy for her during her missions to seek  kill government targets if only because of her original execution of that cop at the start of the filmas a consequence i never really enjoyed the story the style or content of the film until about 5 years later when i bought the videoviewing it again the cop execution still bothers me but the more times i watch the movie the harder i try to look at the reasons why did what she did and what she has now become under the guidance of government agentsanne parillaud is quite wonderful as the troubled and really pulls at our emotions she knows the movie audience out there will be baying for her blood after killing the cop so viciously and yet she also knows that to be believable she has to play the character with so much depth passion  patience until that very same audience finally sees her side of the ugly world and that we can sometimes genuinely sympathize with her nowin positionits a good film if you want to discuss the merrits of the death penalty should cop killers be legally executed or should they be given another chance at redemptionwith bessons he chooses the latter but even though her life has been spared and she has slowly turned into a civilized woman from a punk she is still the same person  a killerthe supporting performances are all very good with superb rounded characters who seem to play on the emotions so muchtchky karyo plays bob the agent who has the difficult task of spending 3 years of his life training the rebellious to a standard of professionalism that will free her into society with a license to killthe relationship between bob  is intense ebbing this way  that will they wont they fall in love if the script was given to a hollywood director he would have gone for the latter if only to placate  appease the audiencethen falls in love with  rico marc duret an ordinary looking guy but with a great sense of humour and an optimistic view on life directly the opposite to s past  present viewseven though she has her freedom she still has a job to do that of killing total strangers but as she becomes more self aware and more deeply involved with rico she finds herself being pulled in 2 opposite directions  to choose between love  deaththe ending is really quite sad but very subtle the action sequences are typical besson  slightly overdone but coated in a style  chicthe script does stretch reality just a tad but the wonderful soundtrack from the reliable eric serra soothes away our nagging doubts  plot pitfallsoverall then is a very well made movie a movie with a conscience that was so lacking in the american remakeif youre one of those people who support the death penalty such as myself then this movie will make you think twice about whether legally killing a murderer for doing wrong is any different from a reformed murderer killing legally for me im still undecided,intelligence
a ten for me has to be one where you enjoy watching it over and over this one you can watch and always enjoy of course many luc besson films usa version has been edited so as to cut out some important relationship scenes i only say that because seems as if there could have be more shown with the relationship between and her instructor but so it goes is a great film,intelligence
if you saw point of no return with bridget fonda you owe it to yourself to see this film la femme while the two films are superficially very similar the original la femme has depth that the remake completely lacksanne parillauds performance is so strong she wouldnt have to speak a single line to convince us of the totality of her metamorphosis from a punkish thoughtless killer to a complex yet sensitive and caring woman more than anything else this movie is a social commentary against the death penalty when anne parillaud recklessly pulls the trigger ending the life of a policeman who is asking for mercy i was demanding she be put to death but almost immediately afterwards parillaud had me feeling sorry for her my feelings flopped back and forth throughout but each time a little less back and a little more forward given a chance an education selfesteem and her femininity becomes a new and decent person a world apart from the life she knew as a druggedout punkdont miss this film anne parillaud turns in an excellent performance that will have you on the verge of tears if not wiping them away,intelligence

this film shines in all respects but none so much as the soundtrack eric serras soundtrack adds more to than the visuals which are outstanding just listening to the start of tipokmop from the restaurant scene overwhelms you with a sense of fear no terror and of an impossibly accelerating out of control situation flipping on a single beat into angry determination and resolve all of which is carefully tied to the visualits also a film with very strong character definition apart from herself her internal conflicts and fear are crystal clear painfully so without being trite the handling of the cleaner is excellent the character is totally deranged but in a cold horrible utterly evil way as if luc besson is giving us a quick peek of what herself might become finally its a film where the psychological elements of the violence are wonderfully played out  instead of the usual gruesomeness inflation this film maintains a very close lead on the feelings of the characters and merely punctuates this with short instances of people being shotforget the absolute rubbish the assassin  hollywood could have learned a lot by watching this film instead of making their own version,intelligence
is one of the best action movies ive ever seen why when shows her ferocity at the beginning of the movie you really want to kill her she is an animal you feel we must eliminate but the story develops it has a taste of reality even if through borderline scenes you understand her feelings she is a killer but also a human being which deserves a better futureluc besson is a great directorforget the american remake its such an awful thing i didnt resist two minutes sometimes hollywood is neatly inferior its a matter of content,intelligence

i think this film was phenomenal until the ambassadors mission started the first half of the film was just brilliantly done the music  the pacing the acting was just wonderful i have never felt so much pleasure in a long time since t2 the judgement day the action sequences was one of the best ive ever seen packed with emotional impact and incredible depth the first half of this film serves everything what a film shouldve done after left and graduated from the training school she lived a joyful life and worked professionally and thats where the second part began which by far was still an amazing film the scene where shes in venice and tried to shot a guy from the window is incredible she cried while her fianc was talking to her threw the bathrooms door that was a powerful scene to me and surely impacted me a lot  but after this scenes finished this film has started to sag the characters transformation from here was totally uncompelling  the way acted so unprofessional and whiny was very weird as the fact that shes been trained for a long time she shouldnt be so sad about it  or if shes supposed to be like that than the motivation should be more convincing and thats where this film has failed after the believably anding of the second act it didnt really feel like it the impact was small the plot havent given an enough incidents to carry the weight of the story  and there wasnt enough conflict to convince the audience that her motivation was right  as a result it didnt feel like there was an ending for the second act until the final mission  which was supposedly being the third act of this film than the film ended left me with a complete shock  and sad because its a pity  it couldve been a masterpiece  but we got an shattered work instead,intelligence
influential as it has been directly remade point of no return 1993 spawned a tvseries and imitated many times might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase s with guns although film buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of film noirthis stylish and audience friendly female fantasy is not a great movie but a very good french film that has some cool artistic touches the lead actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excessthat said this is hardly a believable story but it is fiction at its fanciful best it bridges effectively between the noir and spy genres and it all makes for some fun but suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks this ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction this is a heavy contrast to her hard boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtletyif you feel a need for a foray into foreign films with subtitles this is a good one and no better place to start,intelligence
la femme spawned an american remake and a television series and its correct to say its a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film well i liked itbut didnt love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film still i recommend you see it because the story is quite originalthe film begins with a very violent and senseless crime some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues the police arrive and several of them are also killed one of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murderthroughout the next 20 minutes or so the surviving druggie behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed she is nasty violent and completely antisocial not surprisingly shes sentenced to a very lengthy prison term however something odd happensher death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies this is a neat setup but really made no sense if the government was going to recruit assassins a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice making her less weird whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection processand selecting seemed strange if you can look past all this the film get very interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual lifea conventional woman with a boyfriend and a secret killer to me the last portion was far betterand made much more sense what happens next see it for yourselfits a decent little thrillerin many ways this film reminds me of an earlier film remo williams the adventure beginsthough oddly the setup for remo williams the adventure begins was much better but the mission portion was terrible with la femme it was the exact opposite,intelligence
im giving thanks once again to the older and experienced people for letting me know about european cinema on saturday i got the chance to see luc bessons his first movie after le grand bleu its always strange the difference about the national audience and the international one luc bessons films le grand bleu and had lots of nominations for the csar awards and won some of them however lon usas favorite besson movie it figures in the 55 spot here on imdb didnt win any csar although incredibly besson wasnt recognized as a director until he did his first film in the united states the fifth element which got him his only best directors csar when he was one of the most important cinema icons in franceim glad besson always works with the same crew and team this could be inconvenient for some people because they could prefer change for methis works perfectly today i was talking to my teacher and he described besson as a commercial filmmaker but not in his first features qualifies inside the category of the first features and it has got all the characteristicsan excellent lead anne parillaud i mean wonderful job she absolutely understood the mix between sexuality and violence her character carries the film and there wouldnt be a film without her performance whats your name  everyones asking her she answers the changes her character suffers are not usual in a film i said it as it is theres a different way in europe with cinema theres a different plot line another way of making things but saying it all over again would be useless you should listen to it and see it its worth it you just watch parillaud during the film and be witnesses of what besson is capable in terms of acting direction tchky karyo is superb as bob we know at the moment we see his face he arranges important meetings that unexpectedly turn into assignments doesnt understand it why do you do this to me she asks bob it is my way of loving about love in this movie very much can be said marco really loved her and she never thought about it as they were together she never thought much about bob either it was her own self hidden in the dark for her and nobody else jeanhugues anglade gives marco the perfect balance starting from the man a woman met a simple day and invited to her home the naive marco but theres the other marco violent and lonelyagain and i imagine it hasnt stopped yet eric serra delivers his magic in his magical score in the first scene of le grand bleu i felt his vibe i got the way he was making his score this is the same i felt with his score in but serra managed to make me feel a different vibe he surprised me with another kind of style with more adrenaline but again perfect for each sceneagain yes the cinematography makes its own world and the script is kind of raw as it is real and honest i said some time ago but if the character cant say anything deep or complex its because of its nature s character is not the most intelligent woman in the world although she does what she is requested to when she has to each character with its nature and each frame with its magic and each line with is trueness and luc besson some of the elements that make a lesson about doing if not great original and challenging filmmaking now what can you say about that,intelligence
is one of the best movie of the 90s it is from start to end pure action with great stylish direction by luc besson this man did some great films before he got involved in unserious projects later on such as the fifth element and joan of arc maybe the best scene in is when anne parillaud gets a present from her boss jean reno has a small role victor  nettoyeur which reminds a lot of his later titlecharacter lon maybe besson felt like that kind of character could be something more while lon is a great follow up is just as good on its ownrating 10 of 10,intelligence
la femme is luc bessons masterpiece and in my opinion even greater than leon aka the professional stars anne parillaud as a young drug addicted criminal who gets involved in a deadly shootout and is sent to prison she gets an unusual chance by government in order to stay alive she has to work as an assassin for the government and she is trained to become the bestworks with its great atmosphere style and colors which all together make this one of the greatest action films ever besson directs so smoothly and has a great visual eye camera floats as if it was just a dream the shootouts are often realistic and exciting and any minute you might get hit by an angry bulletthe violence is realistic and never gratuitous or stupid it is a violent and ugly world in which and we all live in there are couple of unforgettable characters here and a cleaner a small role played by jean reno is among them he plays a deadly assassin who cleans kills for living so it is similar role as in leon in which he starred also jeanhugues anglade who played the sicko role in roger avarys killing zoe has a supporting role in but this time he is not bad and the bad mofuka tcheky karuo from jan kounens dobermann is in but not as near as bad as in dobermannthe main theme in is the meaning and power of pure and beautiful love little spoilers s dear fianc is so deeply in love with he doesnt get angry at all when he finally gets to know what his spouse does for living it doesnt matter because love is the only thing that is important between them and with love all the problems can be solved the killings commits make the viewer think that how it is possible for someone being entitled to kill other people for some order by higher level violence never can be justified and thats why also starts to feel sick after shes killed many also innocent people no spoilers anymore this has same themes as leon but as i mentioned i prefer la femme even though leon is also a great piece of cinemahighly recommended for the friends of intelligent and stylish action cinema which cannot be found too often from big studios nowadays unfortunately1010,intelligence
an unrepentant junkie punk in a nameless nearfuture city designed from the same blueprint used in a clockwork orange is arrested and programmed by an elite undercover organization to be the total woman trained in close combat firearms computer skills makeup and housekeeping her mission is to assassinate a series of anonymous vips whose crimes are never explained and no less an expert than jeanne moreau teaches her how to apply cosmetics with as much skill as she wields a gun but with more attractive results the whole idea behind this ultramodern french thriller would be insulting if it werent so ridiculous but the tongueincheek absurdity proves to be a saving grace the plot veers madly back and forth from tender romance to grisly violence but except for the understated charm of boyfriend jeanhughes anglade the emphasis is more on cold often superfluous style theres even a pov shot from a bullet in midflight all that plus travelogue footage of paris and venice in yet another continental attempt to copy popular hollywood role models,intelligence
it doesnt matter how good the acts are it doesnt matter how good the production is if the screenplay is faulty everything is at fault la femme had every single potential element to be a classic and even cult movie but the screenplay failed the whole thing from the very beginning why the french secret service recruited in first place a junkie dark grey almost rotten teeth murderer of a policeman who proved to be completely insane as they could not even let her in common ward in fear of her causing harm to other inmates basically a sick persona who belonged to mental hospital rather than a prison granted that they wanted a killer walking dead to do their dirty and most dangerous job ill emphasis on this subject later but the killer ghost is not supposed to be the crazy untamed animal as was the whole idea was a childs dream a very big defect in screenplay from the very start as the movie continues we see no development in s training as an assassin first she does not cooperate and then all the sudden she decides to cooperate because she realizes that she has only 2 weeks to prove herself worthy but we would not see what happened in next 2 weeks and in reality nothing can happen in 2 weeks but anyways couple of vague scenes follows and then we see her at her 23rd birthday 3 years passed and we saw nothing of her training and her character development from that early wild animal to a classy lady assassin it appears that there is a romance going on between her and rico but thats just a guess from the following acts so i wonder whats the point of making a rated r movies if its supposed to appear like a pg13 another gross failure now lets see how is she doing as an assassinsecret agent i hoped to see something extraordinary to compensate for the previous failures but no nothing her first job is to deliver a bugged plate to a room in a hotel her second assignment is to shoot a lady with sniper rifle really did they go through all that to recruit her to do these kind of jobs and then comes the embassy mission again a gross failure in development of the story 6 months to plan for a very simple mission made complicated the whole idea of kidnapping the senior diplomat and impersonating someone else as him was one big joke aside from the fact that it doesnt make sense for the secret service to plan 6 months on a mission as basic as that anyways that mission was supposed to be the climax of the movie but still the question remains didnt they have normal decent agents to do this job and at the end she leavesescapes leaving her fianc behind and of course a final confrontation between to loverssupposed to be rivals and thats it actions never justified the causes the whole thing became a big joke i would say there was entertainment value in the movie to some extent but it was a cheesy b movie at its best,intelligence
this tour de force guided by the sublime hand of luc besson deserves recognition for  if nothing else  the masterful way the director has taken an unoriginal storyline into a slick stylish and deep moviethe acting throughout the cast is excellent and perfectly understated  the performance of tchky karyo particularly outstanding as the mentor bob the soundtrack largely by the french composer eric serra is a complementary undercurrent plaudits must go to luc besson for maintaining some masterful direction that in no way was mimiced successfully in the uninspiring brigit fonda remake  the assassin it has none of the soul and pace of the classic originalit is a real shame that the film is so hard to get hold of in the uk and it is highly recommended that anyone with an appreciation for the work of a director should try hard to get hold of the film from europelastly please do not watch the film in english  you only end up in losing part of the atmosphere that makes an enduring classic,intelligence
i loved this movie but to be honest i dont really know why the main character is just plain weird and the story is slow somehow it just works give this movie a go if youre looking to be entertained and and weirded out,intelligence
vicious and scrappy junkie street criminal an incredibly fierce and radiant performance by striking brunette beauty anne parillaud gets sentenced to life in prison after she kills a cop receives a chance at a new life and an opportunity for redemption when shes chosen to work for a top secret government agency as one of their key undercover spy assassinswriterdirector luc besson relates the gripping story at a steady pace ably crafts a tough noir atmosphere stages several bracing bravura action set pieces with breathtaking brio generates lots of nervewracking tension in the harrowing last third when one of s covert missions goes disastrously awry and further spruces things up with an amusing sense of brash humor better still the sweet romantic relationship between and her unsuspecting nice guy boyfriend marco a sturdy and likable portrayal by jeanhugues anglade ensures that this film has a winning surplus of touching heart to go along with all arresting slick style the uniformly excellent acting rates as another substantial plus parillaud makes for a strong and sympathetic antiheroine tcerky karyo contributes a spoton sharp characterization as hardnosed but compassionate mentor bob jeanne moreau registers well as the supremely elegant amande and jean reno pulls out the frightening stops with his exceptionally chilling turn as ruthlessly efficient cleaner victor nettoyeur kudos are also in order for thierry arbogasts glossy widescreen cinematography and eric serras spare moody score a total knockout,intelligence
admittedly this is a slick and stylish film but in between the high spots i found it to be long on exposition and dare i say it almost boring what was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenagercop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin what elusive ingredient was part of s anne parillaud makeup that justified agent bob tcheky karyo to go out on a limb to mentor her training that whole part of the story was a disconnect for me and kept rearing its ugly head every time mariejosephine went into a sob over one thing or another i offer that bathtub scene with the coassassin who panicked to support my argument i thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there well this ones been around a long time now twenty years and i finally got around to seeing it based on its reputation but i cant say that i was enthralled the way some of its bigger fans on this board were for some perspective i went back and took a look at my review for that other luc besson genre film leon the professional but that only confirmed my initial reaction here the two hours can be spent better elsewhere,intelligence
this is luc besson at his best  stylish and gritty where violence is used as an adjunct to the story rather than the central theme see bessons joan of arc and the fifth element for other examplesthe hollywood remake of this was sanitised and cleaned up and bore no relation to the original classic in terms of atmosphere or characterisation and precious little in terms of the storylinealthough the film is difficult to get hold of in the uk a quick trip across the channel should enable you to get hold of it in any event beg borrow steal and sell your grandmother to see this,intelligence
this movie was great but i saw it in the originial french version so i had to read the captions in english  the movie was great in means of action the acting was great and the storyline interesting  me and my family watched this fillm and it was beyond our expectations  we loved how changes thoroughout the movie although i didnt see the beginning scenes she is captured inside a prison and is given a chance to live  she is like a terminator although only killing the people that dont deserve to live much better constructed than the american movies  rent it if you havent seen it,intelligence
the original french version arguably better than the american read hollywood version  certainly the acting seemed more genuine and the plot held more depth as a result overall an interesting movie which i havent seen in far too long worth owning if youre so inclined,intelligence
the thing i love about so much is that shes totally raw and honest she doesnt play around anne parillauds interpretation of is superb you couldnt have picked a better cast all great acting especially with jean renos character the cleaner with him you really get to sense what kind of people shes working for you truly sense and feel her desparation and sadness i loved it luc besson is one of the most visually stunning directors around i would definitely recommend    ,intelligence
i normally avoid films with subtitles like the plague with i made an exception and im glad i did from its opening scene it grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and it never let go it also introduced me to the director luc besson the fact that is a french film means that its much more harder to predict when compared to your average hollywood thrillerthe performances throughout the film are all excellent especially parillaud some of the scenes in are so intense and dramatic they will have you gripping the arms of the chair either that or the person sat next to youhowever is not without its flaws the final third of the film is disjointed and loses its way and the ending is very unsatisfying but not even this can detract from what is the most stylish and dramatic thriller of the nineties however please avoid the abysmal american remake entitled the assassin uk or point of no return usand watch this version first or some of the impact of the scenes will be lost,intelligence
this movie is powered by the rivetting action and the great dramaunfortunately there is something lost in the translation  the american dubbing fails to convey the pain and emotions you feel when anne parillaud speaks and cries in her own voiceanne parillaud is quite attractive in her french waif kind of way  the contrast is quite stark when you compare her to kendra torgan killing time who plays a strong and seductive female italian assassinstill if you had to watch only one female assassin movie this would be it,intelligence
because of the genre of this kind of film and also the way the actors play  with clear reality and precision  it is a chef doeuvre of its own let you convince of this and take after a good french red wine to make a good sleep its simply a modern hitchcock,intelligence
take out your thesaurus and look up the synonyms for stylish slick engaging and you can begin to describe this movieluc besson retells pygmalion in such a way that it seems truly original his directing is truly a work of art simply fascinating like kubrick with a heart  the soundtrack is absolutely magnificent  there is not a boring scene in this movie  im sure tarantino got his winston wolfe idea in pulp fiction from jean renos cleanerfor all the lovers of action films you will not be disappointed with this amazing tourdeforce,intelligence
is certainly one of the best action movies i have seen as for meager development of characters well i guess some people just want everything served on a silver plate a la hollywood so they wont have to use their brains and as for the version with bridget fonda dont watch it if you can avoid it the part where gets her first assignmentone word goosebumps,intelligence
i do still like bridget fondas version of this but really enjoyed this original version much more  i liked that in this one the guy is smart enough to figure out what she really is although there are a lot of parallels between the two movies the french version of her death od was set up more sensibly than what was presented in the us version death penalty but then french movies seem to suffer when translated to an american version eg 3 men  a baby perhaps the cultural barrier is as strong as the language barrieranne parillaud is definitely more exotic than bridget fonda at every part of the movie id describe ms fondas looks more as interesting  although in the very positive sense that she inherited her fathers better features  than prettyit is crucial to see a subtitled version and even better to understand spoken french to catch what was not translated in the subtitles also a good exercise for language students overdubbed movies arent worth it and you lose what the casting director intended with the voices,intelligence
i have seen the tv series and movie  i think this movie is really good its funny lots of shooting no questions asked type blood etcthe only part that i dont like about this movie is that the scenes continuity is somehow difficult to track  you gotta figure out at which point is on now  is it 2 weeks ago  2 months  1 year  well watch the movie youll knowbut whatever it is the movie is worth watching and even makes a good addition to your movie collectionak,intelligence
if not then stay away from this thing it does not translate at all jeez you would think wed at least get an accent or two considering that the setting is obviously somewhere in europe anne parillaud plays the killer in desperate need of a breast enhancement the french guy from the patriot plays her opposite very convincingly too if you turn off the sound incredibly this movie is much better in french without the subtitles better than a sleeping pill 510,intelligence
la femme is the story of a young woman who is given a second chance to become a decent human being in society under a new name and persona the catch she must also work for the agency that gave her this second chance as a top secret assassin this brief synopsis alone made me expect much more from this movie than i was given especially when the likes of luc besson leon the fifth element is directing and writing la femme is unfortunately missing the impressive edge ive come to expect from bessonthe film starts out well when we are introduced to our protagonist anne parillaud she is an over exaggerating rambunctious loud individual who hates everyone around her and does not have a problem shouting death threats at every single person in the same room as her shes a fun character to watch and anne parillaud does a fantastic job at playing her tormented and insane role after she is arrested and her death faked the government agency that takes her in begins to rehabilitate her so that she can be reintegrated into society as a normal person save the whole government assassin bit as we watch her character begin to form we are left waiting for the actual goods to be delivered yet i felt like they never were to their full potential i constantly felt i wanted more than what i was being givenfor the most part la femme lulls especially through the middle it picks up at sporadic points only to fall back down again i found myself not quite as engulfed in the story as i thought i would be and most of the time i was waiting for something to actually happen i expected a riveting ending and thankfully this was mostly given to me with the entrance of jean renos character it picked up considerably with some intense action backed by renos fantastic portrayal of the calm cool and collected hitman there is one final conversation between two characters that ends the film and i did feel satisfied after that the ending gave the entire movie some redeeming qualities but didnt completely make up for the lackluster middleby now i feel like ive given the impression that i just plain didnt like this movie thats not true la femme isnt a bad movie it just lacks where youd expect it to excel luc besson is a great director and writer and you can tell by watching la femme for what its worth there are some very well shot scenes some great exchanges between characters and a story that isnt amazing but it is still there and its still relevant all these great elements are just so sporadic that they dont carry through the film as a whole they only stand out when they are present la femme is still a decent film it just could have been so much more,intelligence
french cinema gets a major jolt with this highly stylized thriller director luc besson is a man who works with style be it the deadly serious the professional or the deathly goofy fifth element either way he always has a distinct style functioning through out this is the story of we see at the start of the film as a drugged out addict who mumbles nothing more than i need it the hunt for drugs goes terribly wrong and she is sentenced to death by lethal injection for killing a cop but deep down in the back of our minds we have to wonder if she even knows what she did she is then given the needle but awakens in an entirely white room heaven and greeted by a man dressed all in black telling her that she is dead god or so everyone thinks that man is bob and he informs her that she will be given a second chance at life if she trains to be a secret agent as the film progresses and we seen s transformation you almost have to wonder if death may have been more merciful when we hear the word secret agent we usually think james bond but this is anything but a 007 ripoff it is a bloody action flick a high tension thriller a harrowing love story and a beautiful tragedy ive said it about the professional and i will say it again this film owes more to romeo and juliet than it does to goldeneye or octapussy the love story between and her fiance is packed full of emotion and raw feeling just like your would expect from the french theatre there is always one element in place that we cannot forget is living a double life and her fiance doesnt know about it creating conflict between the two adding another layer of hardship to s life a situation like this could be hard to make both romantic and thrilling but besson handles it with style and grace besson is an expert at making action films with morals films that will invigorate and entice as much as it will put you on the edge of your seat besson also throws in jean reno as victor the cleaner thats hit man for those who havent seen the professional who acts as a heightened point on suspense but takes his role to such an extreme that he also substitutes as an outlet for dark humour all of the actors walk around with droll expressions on their faces like all of them have the power to be happy but all refuse to part of s training it to learn how to smile properly this raises the feeling of tragedy never before have i seen a film where the way a character is portrayed is used as a method of foreshadowing you get the feeling from the very beginning that this will not be a happy film and all of the actors show it on their faces and speak it in the voices even a scene where kisses bob and says i will never kiss you again depict the future of the film this film is acted in such an artistic manner that it is almost a little to exhilarating to take all at once this film keeps its action exciting its suspense thrilling its love passionate and its overall impact strong in other worlds this film packs one heel of a punch and there is no way a film like this could have been made in america or by anyone else but besson my only problem with the film is that the subtitles tend to clash with the backgrounds making them almost impossible to read leaving the viewer to get lost in the films complexity other than that this film is a true art form,intelligence
the dubbed version of this film is too worried with matching the words to the lips  as are most dubs  this completely changes the film i saw it dubbed and hated it i gave it a 10 when i saw it in french  also forget about the tv series,intelligence
sexy stylish very cool though unevenly paced the action scenes pack a huge punch,intelligence
this was one helluva movie  even if you are afraid of subtitles this is worth the effort  hollywood should be embarrassed by the remake and the television series  rent this and watch annie get her gun and pretty much everything else  she is one beautiful lady,intelligence
la femme has become one of my favorites i like common elements and threads that luc besson uses in all his films eg repeating words and phrases like ok good and calm down nice and simple and of course his movie openings very much the same use of the same actors etc i just like besson and of course love anne parillaud does anyone know if there is a directors cut of la femme the sequence of action looks constrained at times and id sure like to get the original,intelligence
is a french flick about a female street hood who offs a cop during a burglary and is subsequently shanghaied by the government and turned into an assassin if the plot sounds familiar its because the film was remade three years later american style with bridgette fonda in the lead point of no return is a gripping saga which focuses on the painful existence of the principal whos torn by a double life one she hates and one she loves an artfully shot well crafted slick seminoir piece stands head and shoulders above the american remakea testament to the fatuous american appetite for film and hollywoods desire to exploit it,intelligence
i had not heard of this movie until after i had seen the remake with bridget fonda kind of cool so the plot had been spoiled for me being that i am not a french speaker i also had to use subtitles the combination of these two downfalls made it only a soso experience i can say that the characters are much more real and much more developed in this movie the relationship between and bob is not only more present but also well defined wasnt as hot as bridget fonda but in the action scenes she outperformed fonda 10 fold the cleaner brought the whole movie together for me as he is one of the best assassins around dont bother with the dubbed version especially when you see the cleaner as the voice they give him made me cringe,intelligence
i first watched la femme about 10 years ago and it almost instantly turned me into a luc besson fan this movie and his later leon the professional are two of my very favorite movies they walk the fine line between reality and moviemaking fable because in many ways we can identify with the characters at the same time fully realizing much of what we see is implausible but it is great entertainment and besson crafts his dialog and images so well that i believe many of his films among them are destined to become classicsnow that i have seen perhaps 5 or 6 times most recently today i am convinced of its excellence what besson has done in almost 2 hours is give us 2 interconnected 1hour stories the first is about the criminal incarcerated and given literally a onceinalifetime chance for redemption refuse or fail and she will occupy the crypt that her family believes she already is in the second story begins when after 3 years completes her training and is given a new life with a new identity but can she cope with it always being on call as josephine the opening scene sets the tone for the entire movie 19 and in a druginduced haze walks the streets in the very late night with her very rough buddies one of them dragging behind him an unconscious comrade their task is to rob a pharmacy and get their next drug fix we arent given any backstory on but whatever it is she has reached the point where her only ambition is the next fixthe theft goes bad people are shot and killed including policemen is arrested tried and her life is gone but in a special secret program she may be given a chance to work for the government as an assassin among other thingsanne parillaud seems so perfect as and in her interview dvd extras she talks about how she literally becomes the character and it shows here apparently besson wrote this story specifically for herthe second main character is tchky karyo as bob the man at the agency who sticks up for and assures the bosses that she is worth training and the third main character is jeanhugues anglade as marco the grocery store checker who becomes s love interest during the second half in perhaps a role that eventually led to leon jean reno has a small but important part as victor nettoyeur the cleaner this is a superb movie and relies more on character study than on action has no inner conflicts as the movie begins she just goes along and waits for her next fix by the end of the movie after she has known what love and caring feel like she is full of conflicts,intelligence
i first saw leon having no idea of luc bessons talent but after leon i just had to see more  so next in line was and this movie is incredible  most people especially americans would expect to find action and explosions which are in this movie but not in the proportion that we are used to  i am an american  although some may classify this movie as an action thriller luc besson never leaves his stories on one level  it actually carries a drama to it with being set up for a job that she cant handle  sort of a redemption story i guess you could say  overall the acting is very good especially for anne parillaud spelling who i believe won an award for this film but check the database for that one of course jean reno does a great job in this film as victor the cleaner interesting to see him in this film to later pick up the same profession in leon  if you ask me a very well put together movie with eric serra yet another man with a talent backing up each scene with his musical score watch this movie carefully there is much to it,intelligence
sure there is some action sequences which really are on a par with the best of john woo but this film is so so much more than that  in the end this is a subtle film about paying for ones sins  and if perhaps there are some sins which can never be paid for in full  we get this in the form of an actionpacked comingofage story of sorts with wonderful unique characters and relationships  an exciting film yes but more so for its subtlety and touching ending butchered  as was the whole film  by the american remake than for its action  the style may be what one first admires but in my case it was what was beneath the surface that stayed with me  a real surprise  along with goodfellas id say is the best film of the 90s,intelligence
the best thing i can say about is that it is the stock film i use to convert friends to watching subtitled movies the plot is a laughable one  but when you watch you dont even notice besson remains one of the most visually stunning directors in the business parilliaud and karyo together are incredible with undercurrents of emotion and desire barely visible but definitely sensed anglade is serviceable as the clerk that falls for but the award for screenstealing goes to reno as victor the cleaner absolutely suberb awhile back a friend asked me if i wanted to see the assasin  i declined without even seeing the film i knew what the hollywood remake treatment was like and had no wish to see such an inferior movie i did however check with all the film reviewers in papers etc that i think are normally worth a damn ie not the sunmirror etc and they were pretty much in accord the best line describing the assassin was a carbon copy of lacking any of the passion or tensionnuff saiddan,intelligence
first off very good movie good performance by parillaud worth watching but what i really want to talk about is thisyears ago i saw point of no return the us version of i remember reading on movie boards the opinion that the remake was utterly worthless just a shotforshot copy of the original but i enjoyed it i did wonder how it would compare with the original now i finally have and have a vague comparison to make vague because its been ten years since i saw point of no returni can understand why people like better parillaud conveys an animal intensity in the role that i dont recall from bridget fondas performance the movie has a gritty feel to it and i recall the us version being more hollywood slick i like both gritty and slick really but based on my vague recollection of the us version i would say it did not have the impact of the french movie on the other hand i recall being very struck by the scenes of the us version involving the cleaner and really i wasnt that impressed with the french one there in fact i thought the movie sort of lost it in the last 20 minutes or so i just didnt buy it in the end i dont actually recall if the us one ended on a more likely note but whether it did or not i would still say s ending weakens the movie as a whole,intelligence
the concept my fair lady meets john woo meets james cameronthis has something of a cult following for foreign action fans  i can understand why given the prestige of the director but doesnt have anything new to show the world  american studios must have thought importing directors was a great idea how else do you explain besson woo and verhoeven getting into hollywood at about this timethe acting even for a french film is daft and contrived  only reno succeeds because little is asked of him other than occupying space  thats all he knows how to do and besson takes advantage of it  he is of course a variant of chow yunfats killer character originating in the first better tomorrowbesson himself is not devoted to his images the way spielberg is thankfully but here he overemphasizes everything  constantly i am reminded of camerons terminator in the pacing rhythms use of lighting and especially sound design  art for exploitations sakewhat got me hooked was the not bessons contribution but serra  serra takes after the cameronfidel techno idea and runs with it  it is this reinvention of music that gets points from me  while techno in hong kong films is awful the europeans understand the genre  after this came lola renntunfortunately for when all is said and done lon did a better job of constructing characters from the environments especially reno and had a cast that understood living in different worlds  besson also got more experimental  here the only experimenting is done by serrafinal analysis   midrange material,intelligence
luc bessons fame as a director is certainly justified however  he deserves less praise as writer of the scripts of his movies  and of others which he usually produces  because the development of his basic  ideas is often full of holes is no exception two examples  goes to venice unaware that she shall have to kill a woman she could  have been in a  place other than her bedroom when ordered on the phone  to do so immediately   and the first task of the italian police shall be tracing the trajectory of the bullet  so i suppose that she shall have to get away as soon as possible  and how to explain such a haste to her lover                  when she is given the mission of stealing documents in an embassy her boss insists it must be done smoothly but when the plan is to be altered as the consequence of a change of code at the embassy she is ordered to go on but now with the help of a cleanup man victor the first thing he does is to kill everybody but including the ambassador  and the latters wouldbe impersonator  agent jules  smooth doing indeed it is left to to impersonate the ambassador  with victor as a driver  nobody questions the change of the usual driver by an unknown one  and  it is no longer question of the overimportant change of code by the wayetc when you see the movie bessons virtuosity prevents you from noticing all these holes but afterwards if you think it over  and you have a good chance to because the film is really impressive you cannot help but becoming aware of them  the imdb file on lists the cast as they appear on the screen so rico  marc duret is not s true love  as written in many comments  but the twogun leader of the drug addicts who attacks the drugstore  marco her love  is played by jeanhughes anglade   killing zoe and maximum risk a van damme film  the choice of the names could have been better,intelligence

is a great french film  one of the best i have viewed in fact i have to do an essay on a foreign film and chose to do this one  problem is  i cant find too much info about it  but i feel that this film is great for firsttime foreign moviegoers as they seem a bit hesitant at first when faced with watching a foreign movie  especially students  because of the assassin i feel that the comparison between the 2 movies will help other countries gain a greater understanding for foreign movies its a must see,intelligence
this is just a precious little diamond the play the script are excellent i cant compare this movie with anything else maybe except the movie leon wonderfully played by jean reno and natalie portman but what can i say about this one this is the best movie anne parillaud has ever played in see please frankie starlight shes speaking english there to see what i mean the story of young punk taken into the depraved world of the secret government forces has been exceptionally over used by americans never mind the point of no return and especially the la femme tv series they cannot compare the original believe me trash these videos buy this one do not rent it buy it btw beware of the subtitles of the la company which translate the us release what a disgrace if you cant understand french get a dubbed version but youll regret later ,intelligence
of the 50 or more french films ive seen this is certainly the best and of the 100 or more action films international included ive seen from the 1990s it was also the best why because it actually was original a paris street junk addict turned elite assassin of course now its success has been sickeningly copied by gravy train riding hollywood producers from point of no return an awful american remake to cia code name alexa crafty but familiar and of course the horrible hour long tv show which is surviving on the usa cable network by the skin of its teeth luc bessons directing and eric serras invigorating music are an excellent combination tcheky karyo deserved a best actor oscar for his cool portrayal of bob the benevolent but mischievious covert operations director anne parillaud had her moments but her annoying screams and masculine demeanor dampened what could have been a flawless peformance jean hughes anglade who played s boyfriend marco was also oscarworthy for his clever quiet character unlike the wimpy and unfit dermot mulroney in point of no returnprospective viewers should not be deterred by the foreign language of the movie the subtitled version is excellent and possibly better for not allowing the dialogue to distract from the fabulous nonverbal acting its simple compact screenplay is also perfect for those learning or wishing to learn the french language which often seems uptight and restricting so get the vcr ready dim the lights and prepare for a rare cinematic thrill,intelligence
this is an action thriller by besson but shows a softer glint beneath the guns a gun opens the night fired by the heroine for no particular reason at all a moments whim but it takes someones life a karmic chain whirs in place she then emerges inside a spyworld where shes going to be groomed to be the action heroine we expect a figurative death has precededbut somethings off in this underground spyworld the effort is not fidelity to genre her spymaster takes a birthday cake to her room the rooms walls are painted with scrawlings like out of a childs paintwork this to underscore something weve been seeing for a while a heroine who is childlike irreverent fragmented besson isnt propping here the cool silent image of the gun totting hero he would lateri am reminded here of ruizs drawings of internal landscape using genre ink dipped in mirrors he would later use parillaud in a film ive seen called shattered image a whimsical irreverence as she flummoxes instructors in the academy this is all ostensibly under the pretense that shes being groomed to be the genre character but its also the entry to whats beautiful here different portraits of this the journey is to womanhood as a woman advises while doing her makeup femininity as growing into and exploring your rolethe role expects pain as all roles do theres a love affair schematic but this is to quickly set up a next life where she has her own life that she shares one of spontaneous gestures joy that just wells up from breakfast in bed  nothing like the soulless angelina jolie products that explain plots but what do we see of that love what pain threatens an ordinarily happy one but suddenly being yanked by doubt josephine on the phone and she has to drop everything and sneak out for the spy story where she has to pretend to be someone else in venice she has to worry about shooting a target while her man outside the door pours out a confession here nothing is really explained of the missions we figure it but the point is the intrusion of a hidden self the spying as doubti dont get from it the coercion and oppression of a beautiful spirit by society this would turn her into merely an icon of purity i see all this as the same obstacles outlandish here to thrill ourselves on the side that every life has to face as it struggles to realize magic in the havoc truth in the duplicity of lifeultimately besson promises a better film than he eventually delivers because the promise is masterful but requires an even more fluid hand i imagine a threehour film in the hands of rivette who gave us celine and julie about s confronting the responsibility to a role a third shift has her disguised as a man in hat and coat abandoning her femininity to snap images of meaningless documents the ending is poignant we never really truly know what casts the shadow this is even before shooting the gun were never told where she goes,intelligence
dont be fooled by style its not a good film the best scenes the opening shootout which is over too quickly its downhill from there i saw this at the movies in around 1990 it was titled then for some reason thought it was okay but looking at it again its not its actually a bit crap it came out on vhs dubbed in english titled even though id seen it at the movies i watched it a number of times at home one time with my dad who was unimpressed i remember him saying something about french films being slow thats right this movies slow it drags on but worse its embarrassing whether its the dubbed in english version or the restored to french language version la femme as originally intended its at times embarrassingly bad those flamboyant costumes in the clothes shopping scenes the cheesy dialogue the romance the on vacationgondoliervenice scenes which play out like a romanticcomedydrama something akin to julia roberts in pretty woman until theres some action which is over in a couple of seconds the best scene was high impact opening shootout ie the drug store robbery which is over too quickly in some ways the films worth seeing just for this scene if only it lasted longer the story was a good idea and is the film stylish sure music very good photography tick but theres an undeserved mystique surrounding this film cause its french so we ignore its bad points its silliness and how boring it is one of the strongest elements is tcheky kayro as bob jean renos victor the cleaner i preferred the cleaner played by harvey keitel in the remake point of no return 1993 aka the assassin,intelligence
i have to admit i watched the tvshow first after seen all the episodes and being thoroughly impressed i decided to watch the original film to be completely honest the film left me wondering if that was it the main characters of the film marco and bob are brilliantly played and the writing for these characters is amazing but the story didnt effect me at all to have a great movie on your hands you need a great story that feels like it has to be told characters that interest you and actors who fill up the parts like they seemed to be destined to play these characters this film got two of the three right but the story felt random and not very believable the real highlight was how changed in the beginning she simply didnt seem to care about anything and came across as if she grew up in the woods but as the film goes on you see a woman emerging and in it the irony that it took a job as an assassin to make her humanall in all i sadly have to disagree with most of the comments the tvshow is still dear to my heart because they captured the concept so amazingly but if you want to see some topnotch acting the check this film out,intelligence
i saw this movie because i am a huge fan of the tv series of the same name starring roy dupuis and pet wilson the movie was really good and i saw how the tv show is based on the movie a few episodes of the tv series came directly from the movie and their similarity was amazing to keep things short any fan of the movie has to watch the series and any fan of the series must see the original ,intelligence
the rowdy guys in rochester had another violent movies for men who like violent movies vmfmwlvm gathering the other night  the movie selected was la femme  overall we liked this movie  they do an amazing job with s transformation  the violence was outstandingunfortunately the overdubbing left something to be desired  the movie definitely loses something in the translation  the dialog is not that good making for a lot of slow scenesone interesting side note comes from a scene where we can see that has been taking art classes  she has apparently brought paint back to her white room and covered the walls with graffiti  this movie was filmed in france all of the dialog was originally in french  ironically all of the graffiti in her room is written in english  this would have been a hard one to pull off with overdubbinggive this movie a shot  its better than any television reality show even if its not in the same league as any quentin tarantino movie,intelligence
the idea of the story is good but the execution isnt too many plot holes and illogical scenes a policeman in the pharmacy could have easily turn her gun away from the chin but he didnt the window in the lavatory that opens to a wall isnt the only one  there are many windows around and so on cast is good as well as performances even the direction and cinematography but the story does not hold compared to leon this is home alone mcmlxxxvii mr besson you can do much better than this,intelligence
architypal luc besson stylish action built on intriguing but implausible conceptsthe modern master of the french action film overcomes logical shortcomings and a certain amount of moral bankruptcy with casting quality and always placing emphasis of the humanity of his lead charactersof course no government would recruit a murdering teenage drug addict as an assassin and no female teenage drug addict is going to be able to fire a high calibre pistol accurately one handed or slap a martial arts expert sillybut besson and his actors work hard to make you care about and her handler and later her boyfriend which is what lifts his movies above the rest of the b movie action field,intelligence

because i enjoyed the film leon very much i was expecting a gripping and cool flick when it came to this so when i read the summary which is about a teenage junkie and delinquent getting hired to be an assassin to be cool but its shown in a very boring manner with boring training sequences that got very tedious i was expecting more thrilling and stealth elements but it got even more ridiculous and boring as the film progressed the actress did a fine job when playing a junkie and a delinquent but i just couldnt buy her as this sexy and alluring femme fatale they should have focused more on bringing about more interesting and alluring aspects to her training like how she learns to use her femininity and sex appeal during the training this is a dreary movie that fails to entertain and has very poor pacing and structure it would have done better as a television series with using her street smarts and other assets while she goes on different missions while bringing about more development to the settings missions and characters overall this was a distracting and disappointing film from luc besson the best parts are the scenes with jean reno playing another hitman410,intelligence
having read some of the positive reviews i was looking forward to this film but i was sadly disappointed it was quite well made and the story is a good one however the main problem with it is the casting of herself anne parillaud just doesnt convince in anyway that she is either a drug addict or a trained assassin her portrayal of a drug addict seemed to consist of her screaming and acting in bizarre ways and as an assassin she just never looked like she could beat anyone in a fight or fire a weapon effectively i know some of the purists decry the tv series but maggie q was a much more convincing in my view,intelligence
convicted felon instead of going to jail is given a new identity and trained stylishly as a top secret spyassassinthis film had difficulty holding my attention i wanted it to because i know it is something of a cult classic but it just did not have much going for it that interested me the advertising even seemed weird comparing this film to lethal weapon huh the best part was probably the casting of jean reno although he may be somewhat typecast in popular imagination as a thug or hitman see of course the professional this happens to be the sort of role he excels at being one of the guys with a gun in this film made it more enjoyable,intelligence
i had high expectations because i liked leon or the professional so much but this movie was just not as good i rated it a 7 because of the stylish production and the great performances by the actors if a movie with a fantastical plot premise is going to work for me then the plot elements have to be plausible i didnt buy the main characters reluctance to kill during the later parts of the movie she had been completely nonchalant about killing and instinctively and unreluctantly violent at the beginning of the movie and then she had been trained and indoctrinated as an assassin for 3 years i suppose 6 months of looking at jeanhugues anglades disarming happysad smile might have that effect but i didnt buy it i also cant believe that the french government would have tolerated its agents instigating all that shooting and destruction in a public restaurant and i cant believe they would change their minds so quickly and order the killing a foreign ambassador another big distraction for me was that anne parillaud could not remotely pass for the age of the character19 years old at the beginning of the movie and 24 at the end,intelligence
decent enough shootemup which relies too heavily at times on ridiculous overkill to make the antiheroine look way bad how would one describe this killing machine anyway sexy yes evil most assuredly sociopathic dont think so she appeared to wear her feelings on her sleeve all the way through the picture which no self respecting nutcase would ever do every time things began to go wrong for little nikki she would break down in hysterics crying for mercy her mommy or a little peace please mr policeman this idiot could go from coldly murdering her victims to blinding rages in which she threatens to kill everybody present to sweating over a kill she is about to make the whineyslobbering lunatic weirdo bit was incompatible with a hired gun working for a clandestine government unit furthermore large jumps in time were momentarily confusing and could have been better explained by the writers not a bad film just full of holesbut didnt that have a set of legs,intelligence
i agree with most of the comments that this film from a cinematic point of view was well made the direction and acting were good however the bottomline of any movie is how well it tells a story i had trouble buying the basic premise that the government would approach a recently convicted psycho murderer and decide it would be a good idea to train this person to be an assasin without any previous screening or training how about we give a gun and put her on the street  can we control her well we did have a little trouble getting her to eat her vegetables but what the heck well just stay out of the way when the bullets start flying  as pointed out in other comments this wasnt the only hole in the story but it seemed to me it was the most important and no one in these comments seemed to catch iti also thought the pacing was slow besson needed some better editing i found myself dozing off at some points  i also didnt like the ending that left you hangingi agree that leon is a better flick for this type of movie however if you are a student of foreign films or you think the look and feel of a film is more important than the story making sense you will probably want to catch this one  i give it 65 out of 10,intelligence
point of no return vs point of no return made me have a crush on bridget fonda for a week while left me with a whole lot more point of no return remake of this film was a typical american action movie it was a good action movie but it was missing the emotion that this one had harvey keitel played victor in point of no return while jean reno does that here reno played a cleanup man think leon with emotion he even laughs while keitel played a killer with suitcases full of acid fonda plays anne parillauds role of the criminal turned government killer fondas character looked anemic while parillauds looked downright sadistic even the lovers act differently fonda and mulroney were great together in point of no return parillaud and duret looked better together not to mention more realistic besson the director writer and parillaud were married at one time so that could be why this film told the story better,intelligence
la femme is one of the best actionthriller spy movies to come out in the 90s luc besson became a name upon moviegoers lips from that momentfrom the films brutal introduction to nerve racking ending this film is in my opinion one of the greatest commercial french films a great deal of people believe that french films have to be boring or art house well this movie has adrenaline but also has a interesting imagery to it the characters and supporting characters are all stylish with each underlining imagery that go with themexample when our heroine goes on her first mission she meets her team the team is filled with men with earings dreadlocks and even ganger looks these agents do not resemble the clean cut tuxedo wearing james bond there is also a mixture of cultures which i find refreshingeven the action is stylistic luc besson created the camera pov of the bullets trajectory which was i believe was stolen by robin hood  prince of thieves 1991la femme is much better than its boring american remake point of no return  the movie was good enough to be shown in the states without having to be remadei recommend this movie to whom ever are in the mood for a good story and a great set of action sequences,intelligence
warning  spoiler belowgreat style in moviemaking but the story drags forever  the director didnt know how to reveal s background in telling bits and pieces instead we get her whole biography from the time shes picked up off the streets  in effect the first half of the movie is all prologue and little of it interesting at that,intelligence
i usually dont watch french movies but i did this one and it really was outstanding but looks like luc besson doesnt have luck with his leading ladies anne parillaud wasnt even close to being a real in my opinion bridget fonda was much better in the same role tcheky karyo and jean reno were absolutely magnificent two of the brighter spots of the movie and now heres an interesting did you know the first time this movie aired in croatia after the war in that last short scene where did her last mission was obvious that it happened in the embassy of the former yugoslavia so guess what they did they cut the complete scene out of the movie and aired it like that,intelligence

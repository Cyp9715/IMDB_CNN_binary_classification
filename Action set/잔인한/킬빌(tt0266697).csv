having seen tarantinos 3 previous films going into the cinema my expectations for were already over the roof however regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment i was not prepared for this film i was dumbfounded i was blown away i had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like itin the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc thus allowing tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes and boy  what a mix he dishes out with complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style the likes of which the world has never seen before cinema rarely gets this exciting with tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified he is the most daring original  and entertaining  filmmaker of his generation simply amazing 10 stars out of 10lesserknown masterpieces httpwwwimdbcomlistls070242495favorite lowbudget and bmovies httpwwwimdbcomlistls054808375alltime favorite films httpwwwimdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbs,cruel
just saw vol 1 and was surprised to be honest at how incredibly good this film is here is a craftsman or artist if you prefer at the top of his game some of the shots are simply incredible the score is for the most part vintage tarantino selections and the rza does a very good job at filling the blanks uma thurman is a great female lead for sheer presence and decent acting chops even lucy liu who i expected was going to rehash her charlies angel character burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuckthe stringing together of the scenes was impeccable the transitions the intercutting between dialogue the flashbacks i simply could not get enough tarantino is indeed having fun here he is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic pulp fiction style but that shows us what is yet to come i doubt that hes lost his writing talents as some have claimed and i actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is poor or that there are no memorable lines empire the kungfu genre has never been a particularly good park to display shakespearean writing virtuosisms the lines work fine the plot is simple enough but tarantino takes a burger and serves it as steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine he basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent what is relevent is the brides thirst for blood her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her bill of course is one of the greatest characters to ever not appear on screen overall a great movie and an example of how a filmmakers tool is not his pen its his eye,cruel
a lot of people have come up to me and said how can you love quentin that much he is just too extreme or oh come on is just so not realistic yes nomr quentin tarantino is rather extreme yes and its lovely and no is not realistic but its not meant to be realistic just like lord of the rings thats not realistic either but because it has clear unreal elements like wizards its acceptableyou dont go to see or any other qtfilm to see stepmom in the same way you dont go to a marilyn manson concert hoping that they will play some spice girlsboth volume 1 and 2 is absolutely gorgeous the art direction is beautiful the camera angles are perfect just gorgeous the lighting the sound the dialogs and of course the details no one works with small details the way quentin does i must also say that the soundtrack is brilliant and the whole film is just so well casted uma thurman is perfect in the leading role darryl hannah has never been this good before ever and chiaki kuriyama even though she has a quite small role is excellent even better than she is in battle royale david carradine is painfully perfect michael madsen is always excellent but never as good as when he works with tarantino i must also say that sonny chiba was great ive never been a big fan of vivica a fox until now and i used to think that lucy liu was just your average actor but she turned out to be fierce pretty much everyone who is in this film is ten times better than theyve ever beenbut above all things is artistic beautiful perfect colors perfect everything gotta love it,cruel
i know its a couple years late but i had to write a review for some of the few people that havent seen one of my favorite and refreshing ive seen over the last few years vol 1 is yet another quality film of tarantinos short but distinguished listinvolves a nameless woman uma thurman who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the viper squad and her boss bill david caradine her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant a few years later she awakens in a hospital without child and tries to track down each member of the squad as the story progresses through this film and the sequel you find out who she really why bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughterthe movie is really a combination of tarantinos love for the 70s overdramatized kungfu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog yes this movie is violent but in a cheesy way this created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism like i said it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick with all cheesiness aside i can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of koolaid red blood shoot out of the body like a whales blow hole what really makes this movie is tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline of course this is what he does in pretty much in all of his moviesthere are various plot holes in the story but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies just like the gory scenes come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie the movie also features a couple of classic tarantino showdowns including an unforgettable one with the japanese infamous crime lord oren ishii lucy lui once again tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding japanese animation for character backgroundsi wouldnt really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the pulp fiction era this film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on sunday samurai showcase revenge and tarantinos continuous fascination with uma thurman this film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing if youre not a fan of tarantinos films you should pass on this one because it is doesnt stray to far from his other stuff if you like his other works this is a must see due to its originality and quality and if you just dont like tarantino himself and find him annoying like everybody else i dont blame you but its still worth your while seeing,cruel
this is movie is unusual but it works for me it kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not entirely clearly but that made it more interesting for me theres a lot of action in the movie which i found excellent and enjoyed a lot it might not be realistic but its a movie so it doesnt have to be the plot is amazing and i cant wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was,cruel
man what a film as a fan of 70s martial arts movies it was great to see all of the references i also thought the use of bw throughout was extremely effective the cartoon sequences seemed a bit much but did fit in with the overall feel of the film i have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts but you have to remember this was tarantinos homage to bruce leeera action pictures in those movies the stories were very similar epics of revenge and they never had much of a budget for good gore effects it was more or less throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed type of effects which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie the plot also followed closely the plot of most 70s kung fu movies something despicable happens to the weak hero whole village razed family slaughtered etc and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of kung fu all of these movies contained the secret move which the master normally does not teach except of course in this rare instance that move as depicted in vol 2 is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the herowas a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient china i was very impressed with uma thurmans swordplay at no point did i feel that it looked scripted or fake even when fighting against more than 50 crazy 8s it replicated admirably the incredibly onesided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years agoall in all a great and original film r,cruel
vol 1 2003 is a unique film ive never seen anything quite like it my commentary for this film is almost all positive first off the cast really blew me away each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles uma thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene shes in its not just the action sequences that she is great in shes just perfect for the role all around and it wasnt just her that i loved i also liked vivica a fox daryl hannah and lucy lui they all showed off their acting chops here especially fox i personally loved her short time shes in the film the writing is well done i especially enjoyed thurmans dialogue the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great i think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie as long as theyre not too conservative that is i say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody but in a strange way it kinda works for this one im usually not a big fan of that but here it works good job tarantino 810,cruel
sure its outlandishly violent and bloody can anyone expect tarantinos movie not to be a true mindblowing adrenalinepumping shocker  of course not  gritty and slick his first installment of kb rocks with moody western imagery the 60s and 70sera of hong kong martial artsaction the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship and japanese anime like in all his films tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror its impossible not to smile over the shaw bros iconic introduction ploy and the de palmaesque split screens observe the carrie blankstarry eyed image settled on the brides gory face as shes introduced to the audience perhaps uma thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellowsuited bruce lee in his last film the game of death or is the bride just another little western girl playing at being a samurai  as oren ishii blatantly puts itthis films a sampling of the tarantino fury short of the tarantino customary fiery tongue it celebrates the tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computergenerated cgi special effects its almost as if im watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage thats displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multilayered kungfu and female samura swordfighting styles to dazzle the audience its examining how tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite oldschool filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film yep theres a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful the music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding they set the moods so appropriately with the eventseven at the house of blue leaves we get to see tarantino weaving the artistic styles of lucio fulci changche sergio leone kurosawa zhang yimou and busby berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur the themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong every camera shot and scene seems to scream out nonstop and all of bills dvas members  my adrenalines still flowing as im recalling the scenes tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts a,cruel
do i think this movie is absolutely brilliant yes do i think this is the all time greatest movie ever or even a top 50 nope i find the dichotomy between people who hate this movie and those that think its the greatest film ever made is interesting even more interesting is the apparent split between fans of volumes 1 and 2 like the thread says i think most of its a matter of those who prefer style to substance for my past volume 1 destroys volume 2 but i concede that everyone has their own tastes and experiences and that no one pinion has any more weight than the other two scenes in particular really make this movie brilliant in my opinion and both are fairly subtle in their portrayal but fascinating by their tone and the cinematic elements that come together to carry them off1 the scene where oren and the crazy 88 enter the house of the blue leaves absolutely magical the score the pacing the atmospheresimply magnificent the slow motion pull away and the obvious hierarchy of characters lucy liu was absolutely made for that part and that part was made for that scene the beautiful and menacing gogo yubari and the goofy 88s trailing behind you can also feel the tension the owners feel at having such esteemed guests but ones who admittedly exude as much fear as they do respect add to this the nameless faceless people dancing who are oblivious to the regality and lethality of orens entourage 2 oren is called out by kiddo who subsequently whacks off sophies arm in a highly symbolic gesture words cant describe how moving that scene is the score is superb and the timing is nothing short of perfect i especially love the way the crowd pauses after the arm slicinglike theyre all stunned or still convincing themselves it rally happenedthen all rush out screaming kiddo makes a slow deliberate plod through the panicked crowd a march to destiny filmed from several perspectives that combine holistically to give the segment a life of its ownone aspect of this movie that puzzles me is the emphasis its critics make of the gore for my part the gore was so outlandish its hard for me to see how anyone could take it seriously and that was part of the appeal buckets of blood spraying 15 feet in the air is so beyond the realm of reality how could you possibly take it seriously for my part it was borderline comical and really brought out the flavor of the scenes rather than being their focus and regardless of what you think of tarrentino as a director the man is bar none the best at matching musical scores to a scene in the business a few other noteworthy scenesthe endfight between oren and kiddomarvelous stuff the backdrop of the snow and the water the smooth silence interrupted by the fountain again a great accompanying score fine piece of film craftsmanshipkiddos overhead film shot while walking to the bathroom of the house of the blue leaves simply amazing 5678s performing live is just quirky yet proper enough to really add some depth and the unique filming make this a scene to behold,cruel
probably tarantinos most universal movie to date with a little less character dependency than most of his films and a more linear approach than usual volume 1 is a great place to start for anyone new to his movies i dont mean to imply this is a shallow film far from it i simply found it easier on the mind than tarantinos other moviesuma thurman left for dead by her exboyfriend bill doesnt die and begins her quest for vengeance by hunting down bills gang members in a search for bill armed with a samurai sword and a deadly blend of martial arts skills uma delivers action violence and passion as she plays out the character with beautiful precisionneed i say this is excellently directed brilliantly scripted and cast and should be in everyones tarantino collection1010 second only to pulp fiction although it has wider appeal i think,cruel
it has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the worlds most talked about directors quentin tarantino but the wait for me has been worth the while tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece to his resume a film that left me speechless after i had seen it  it certainly is one intense hateful movie containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie tarantino has made kb with class precision and close intense attention to every detail but what else should we expect from a movie freak like quentin tarantinoan entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel the pregnant woman in the bloodsplattered wedding dress is black mamba better known as the bride the assassin bill and his circle known as the vipers leave tb for dead however she was merely comatose four years later tb suddenly awakes from her coma ferociously focused on one mission to seek revenge on her former master one by one she will kill the various assassins she is saving bill for lasti am not sure where i want to start with my review of i love parts of it but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch quentin tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema in a way that only he could this time we see more violence the action and the result of that violence with it being a bit overpowering in the end but without the violence kb would have not been the movie it wasthis time tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie when it came to writing its script more he wanted to show what the characters he had created and why they were in the position they were in for me i can appreciate both aspects of what tarantino shows as he can express himself either visually or with dialoguethe other part i like about kb is the way tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history to quote quentin he said is my yakuza movie my samurai movie my spaghetti western movie and it was quite clear for me how passionate tarantino was in showing these parts however it was also so much more with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in japanese animation i also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies as kb had these sections a few times i also feel that tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to pulp fiction the movie that made him successful via kb if this is true i do not feel it is gloating rather i give tarantino great praise because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success but not herewhile kb has some interesting characters none are what i would call likeable the bride aka black mamba uma thurman is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge thurman really suits her part well as she not only looks attractive but is really believable as this american martial arts tough girl helping tb on her quest is samuri sword expert hattori hanzo sonny chiba this character brings a very oriental feel to the movie something i liked the bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played outthe deadly viper assassination squad are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on tb bill david carradine is their leader a person we only hear and see in hand gestures which is reminiscent of marsellus wallace in pulp fiction bill still has a very strong presence in the film even though we never see him under bill are killers like oren ishii aka cottonmouth lucy liu whose introduction via the japanese animation was great under cottonmouth is her personal assistant lawyer and translator sofie fatale julie dreyfus who was present at the slaughtering of tb when tb sees sofie once again she is pretty bitter about what sofie let have happen to her what we hear has happened to sofie at the hands of tb is truly unbelievableanother of cottonmouths women is a little girl go go yubari chiaki kuriyama who is more deadly than she looks her school girl sound and look is very interesting while her confrontation with tb highly entertaining then there is the evil nurse elle driver aka californian mountain snake daryl hannah who shows very little emotion towards tb other than hate vernita green vivica a fox is another woman that tb has on her hit list her demise was highly entertaining to say the least again reminiscent of pulp fictionall the scenes with fighting in kb are a highlight for me especially the sword fighting as they are so fun and intense with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting with the final showdown between tb and cottonmouth  co being terrific the middle section of film was also great as it tells the majority of the kb vol 1 story although parts are pretty disturbingis another film by quentin tarantino where i have to say it was exceptionally well made there is a scene in volume 1 which reminded me of matrix reloaded now i have heard that tarantino hates the matrix franchise and you can see what he is making a stand against films laden with sfx kb is not guilty of being that the violence is very graphic in kb but at certain times the violence was laughable as it seemed to look deliberately fake but perhaps i am wrong volume 1 ended at a good point setting up the conclusion volume 2 beautifully so volume 2 get here asapcmrs gives volume 1 45 very good  brilliant film,cruel
mild spoilerswhat a dissappointment especially after the awesome trailer  i had several problems with this film1  i didnt care about any of the characters  there was no introduction to any of them apart from the superviolent anime section introducing lucy liu so i did not understand or care about their  motivation  why was any of this happening2  it lacked the dark humour of tarantinos earlier films especially in terms of the sparkling character dialogue eg samuel l jackson  john travolta in pulp fiction of which there was none  the dark moments eg the rapist hospital worker were humour free and quite sickening3  swapping the timelines around is an old tarantino trick that worked brilliantly in pulp fiction but added nothing to this movie except you knew the ending about 5 minutes into the film4  i got bored  the final battle lasts forever and becomes dull after the first few people get their limbs removed  the scenes where uma thurman convinces sonny chiba to make her a sword add nothing but minutes to the moviewhy wasnt it edited down and made into a single complete better movie so dissappointed,cruel
the fourth film by quinton tarantino as the credits shamelessly explain is yet another bankable classic from a director whos already changed the art with reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brownfrom first surprising gunshot to its monumental cliffhanger ending right up there with luke i am your father  the movie is relentlessly intense tearing an audience between wanting more action and wanting a cigarette to calm frayed nerves we follow the tale of the bride played to convincing vengeful perfection by uma thurman as she sets out to murder her former colleagues members of the deadly viper assassination squad and their leader the enigmatic faceless bill after attempting to leave the group of assassins for a normal life the bride is tracked down on her wedding day and witnesses the murder of her wedding party right before bill puts her in a coma four years later a very angry bride wakes uptarantino pulls no punches creating as one critic put it the most violent film ever released by an american film distributor squirting blood and flying limbs abound but the director does it all with a breathtaking sense of style we witness one sworddance in silhouette one in black and white one over a beautifully filmed snowcovered japanese garden and even a sequence in anime kbs story is minimal but tarantinos aim is style sergio leone cheh chang and bruce lee are all paid homage and then gracefully outdonethe soundtrack primarily japanese artists performing american styles is haunting tarantino breaks form by not using wellknown american classic rock who could forget being stuck in the middle of mr blonde and a helpless cop but by doing so sets the perfect mood of the film theyre songs weve never heard before but feel strangely connected toyes the movie is in two volumes however the end feels right coming after an epic battle that puts reloadeds burly brawl to shame is a testament to tarantinos ability to take the craft of his idols and make it his own mixing classic cult film style and mixing it with his own wicked sense of cool not for the faint of heart or anyone looking for a feelgood film but is at the very least an instant classic,cruel
i dont know what people like about this movie everyone told me to see it the critics my aunt and the kids i went with however i was in for a major surprise the kids i was with didnt even enjoy the gratutious blood or the really cool ninja action this type of movie crouching tiger hidden dragon clone is getting really old and i wish other moviegoers would start to agree i really cant think of too much i liked about this movie other than one side character who was particularily interesting however she will not be enough reason to go to see part two i have a feeling shell make a comeback quentin tarantino is just getting worse with every movie as a 13 year old boy said tome as we walked out its like they were trying to be funny but it really wasnt funny it was just stupid,cruel

spoiler alert i like reservoir dogs and pulp fiction the story line was strong in rd and less so in pf pf though had interesting subplots that loosely wove together to make a good moviei also see the genius in the dialog in rd and in the characters in pulp fiction i was expecting to see something in this movieunfortunately was not interesting nor genius and did not have a plot basically the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hitlist of people from which to extract revengethe way she extracts revenge is to engage in handtohand or martial weapon on weapon combat of course the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the listi think luci liu sp is the 3rd person on the list the movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a okinawan curved sword now armed with the best weapon she takes on lius whole team of trained martial artists  and whips them all single handedly im talking 20 30 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room she still winsthen she battles the board leader and after sufficient scenery changes she wins againeach of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood as youd expect from the director i wont try to spell his name but you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times wait my mistake you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie after the lius character is killed 3 is checked off and the movie endsthere is no plot the special effects and battle scenes were state of the art but do not make a moviei have no interest in part 2 because i have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about uma killing people with swords 2 hours was 15 hours too muchtwo thumbs down dont believe the if any hype,cruel
just goes to prove how moronic most present day moviegoers are how anyone could give this a rating above 3 is totally beyond me the movie is badly written and directed end of story the visuals are just a compendium of clichs stolen from countless other films the plot is just any excuse for a bunch of overthetop scenes of martial arts violence stolen from every bad b martial arts film in existence the only exception being the bad b martial arts films are 50 times more entertaining than this overblown garbagefest and if i were uma or lucy or any of the other actors i would be embarrassed to see my name on the credits if you want to see a good film of this nature see peter jacksons dead alive or sam raimis evil dead those are at least fun overthetop violent films the chances of my seeing part 2 after this are 0 to none at least i didnt pay anything to see it because thats what it was worth,cruel
spoilersfirst of all let me warn you ive always detested tarantino so i didntgo see this film free of prejudicethat said i cant think of a worse film ive seen lately except the matrix reloaded the reason is that tarantino shows too much violence and that he doesnt show anything else but thats the point some will say the point of what ok lets make a film and lets show a rape and say that thats the point does that mean that the film is goodtarantino has always been overrated i disliked pulp fiction as well the reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy so many will feel smart by saying that hes a genius that his films are masterpieces and all that crap the plain truth is that hes either a sadistic voyeur or a cunning man whos found a way to make pots of money by exploiting peoples naivety or bothalthough i dont like gore or black humour i sometimes appreciate it eg some films with vincent price the point is trivial but worth making black humour has to be well humorous the problem with tarantino is that hes nothing a vacuumsome reviewers have said that if you dont understand what this film is about you just wont get it that its a mockery and so on the problem is that if one treats himself to shallow uninspired unoriginal uninventive films who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someones money problems for the rest of his life you may find such a film creative or inspired instead of just the trick it istarantino is in quotations he quotes all the time but a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice after that it cant hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the referencesif you watch a gory bmovie or any bmovie for that matter you may like it even love it but youd never go so far as to claim its a work of art tarantino is hip for the time being so its fashionable to call this lame director a geniusbut time will tellremember david lynch,cruel
spoilersand a lot of them toosince i am not a brainwashed cult follower of quentin i was able to actually see the movie before rating it as the best thing ever madethe first minutes were incredible and i was having the time of my life opening scene in black and white bloodied uma then fade to black melancholy music fading out to perfection suburbia toys in yard nice pretty house then we have a funny as hell chick fight which is made all the better by a little kid that just stays there and says nothing basically the imagery is great and sets a mood then we have a flashback to the wedding followed by a hospital scene giving some background of what just happened and it ends the moment you see black mamba telling her big toe to move while the camera repeats this a few times you have a problem the first thing you realize in the frames after we finally stop zooming on the toes is that well this is nothing more than a charlies angels rip concept and idea ok there is still time for salvation right not really because then comes an anime scene that has no purpose at all and unless you are an anime fan it will simply suck lots of animated blood still motion drawings and all other things we have seen in countless anime toons on cartoon network come to life you can safely skip it not like something valuable will occur which is the problem with this whole movie it has no coherence you can watch it at any point and not miss a thing but it gets worse next on the murder list is the same girl we saw in the anime scene and she is in japan so black mamba goes to japan and what follows for the other half of the movie is mindless kung fu that is bad a lot of stupid time wasting moments of japanese people speaking japanese wise words which are translated in annoying captions actually that would have been a nice touch but they literally never end japanese subtititles more useless preaching wise men advice captions japanese captions repeatalthough it is basically badly executed kung fu even it suffers from some pretty obvious faults booze drinking schoolgirl uniform wearing underage female guard come on and just to mention the tie wearing sword swinging guards samurai that just keep on coming please its a parody a pathetic attempt to mix the infamous japanese gangs of the 80s and 90s with ancient kung fu and traditions at least thats the best i could make of iti am not going to guess what that movie was trying to be because it clearly had no point it started great it fell apart in about 2 minutes literally 2 minutes and that is even sadder save your time watch the first thirty minutes then go rent a real kung fu flick to fill in the rest,cruel
if tarantino is a genius then i was a genius at age twelve  with dialog like silly rabbit trix are for kids i dont understand why people fawn over this juvenile imbecile  his homages are just blatant rip offs of movies that weve already seen   some of which are so dumb that only tarantino could be impressed by them is just an idiotic excuse for teenage mentality violence  how dare they call this excellent film making,cruel
i hate this movie a lot i have been going on about it for a while so i think its time to take my anger out by making a review i think i may have offended some people and i apologize so here it goes is a very bad movie i assume that quentin tarintino immediately drew in fans with pulp fiction because of its wit and it was high on the cool factor i saw some of it and i will say that it was impressive but it looks like tartintino became lazy by making this and codirecting the crappy sin citythe storyline of is about its name bill attacked a woman who we know as the bride her name is censored when mentioned now the bride wants revenge on bill and members of a gang called the deadly viper assassin squad so she goes out and finds them and attacks them the story ends there and it does well sort ofthe story is something that was thought up in a few minutes the bride wants to kill people and she does as simple as that volume one really is just shallow characters killing each other first she battles some woman i have no clue what her name is though then we find some history of the bride after we find that the bride was somehow knocked out i forgot why when she wakes up we experience more brutal torture of people then she gets a sword and kills lots of other people the endi find this very similar to sin city its a gory shallow and pretentious action film that was made to show off a visual style and action scenes the only real difference is that sin city had something close to a storyline this one didntsupposedly this is tarintinos homage to martialarts films so that makes it a masterpiece that makes it get onto the top 250 movies is that why its rated so highly it has plenty of references to other martialarts films for example uma thurman wears a suit that looks similar to the suit worn by bruce lee in one of his previous filmswell the ring has loads of homages to horror films including rosemarys baby silence of the lambs and poltergeist wheres that on the top 250 movies well the homages seem as a coverup for the storys weakness why does a bodyguard fight in a skirt i know people get attacked in a number of outfits but since when does a bodyguard decide to fight in a schoolgirl outfit the anime scene is near pointless and doesnt even look like anime it looks more like an attempt at drawing realistically and ends up looking pretty uglymaybe its because of the action well there are only about two or three fight scenes and they are only a bit exciting there are plenty of other movies which have better action for example ultraviolet another bad movie had more action than and a number of good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair if that had homages to other films would that be on the top 250 i must say even the action in the karate kid seemed to have a certain wit to itall the action in is meaningless it is meant to entertain but with loads of blood what fun could it be its fun to watch the bride slash her way through people but after severed limbs appear it loses its fun the violence in saving private ryan and i think the violence in the wild bunch had purpose but this like sin city is just sick cruel violencewith that there are plenty of movies with good action such as terminator 2 judgment day princess monoke house of flying daggers and the quick and the dead all of these had better storyline that even if the quick and the dead seemed a little weak in that departmentbacking up to horror films i see that this film plays out like a mix of scream and hellraiser bloodline one person repeatedly tortures victims like pinhead with a blade like scream sadly its not as thrilling as scream its as thrilling as hellraiser bloodline the characters are thin im not talking about thin as in skinny but lacking detail sure the bride gives a bit of inside info on them the inside info is showing the character killing somebody else but the characters usually die after thatthe action seems too unrealistic our main character kills plenty of people but how she jumps in the air and lands on her sword its stuck into the stairs but how does she do that there are some movies with unrealistic action sequences house of flying daggers crouching tiger hidden dragon but those take place in ancient china this takes place in a modern day setting and doesnt feel like either one of those filmsthats why i hate the film i can go on and on but why should i have to i suppose i hate it for all these reasons maybe the hype killed it or it could be because dan grants review influenced me to hate it either way i dont like ityet there are some good points to this movie the action can be fun for some i dont think torture is necessary though the music was excellent i liked the bang bang and twisted nerve song i suppose it does seem interesting at parts like when it turns into anime even if the scene seemed pointless or blackandwhite but this was already used in many other moviesbut it still stinks to me this is about as bad as ultraviolet its shallow and uses style to cover up its crappiness210,cruel
before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review let me clear a couple things up one i usually love tarantinohis directing writing the films hes produced etcand two the reason i didnt like volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violencegore i love that stuff and thats the only part of the film that i found even mildly entertaininginstead the problem with volume 1 is that it is extremely boring almost completely lacks suspense has awful pacing and makes a number of selfindulgent stylistic missteps i say almost completely lacks suspense only because of the first relatively short section where uma thurmans character a former hitperson fights with another of the same kind played by vivica a fox suspense arises here because we dont know who the characters are yet we dont know anything about the plot we dont know what their motives are etc there is a sense of venturing into the unknown where anything could happenhowever after this tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of nonsequential story construction and the bulk of the film concerns uma thurmans attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed that saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something were already aware of it has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell that story for the fiftieth time this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two and youre trying to read a book while theyre telling ityes tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a homage that geeky fanboys can have a party game withthe one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of hawaiian punch who cares that in itself doesnt make a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story there is a reason that dvds consisting only of promotional trailers arent usually bestsellersyes there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in however there arent enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a storyand yes as i mentioned i thought the overthetop violencegore was entertaining if looked at isolated from its context quentin almost outdoes sam raimi ala evil dead here however and this is a big however due to having to consider context raimis gallons of blood worked much betterbecause they were in an engaging suspenseful story in the violence was almost boringin an effort to be retro hip tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as president bush in an iraqi mosque these are ubiquitous and varied ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue to the strained inclusion of sonny chiba to the ridiculous presence of a female japanese band who cant sing or play their instrumentseven though theyre only trying to play iivv rockabilly and by the way if this is what tarantino think counts as quality music what was he doing as a judge on american idol to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene the latter is there just because quentin and the fanboys think its cool for me however it underscores both the problem with most anime and with yes the subject matter the violence the attitude etc are interesting but the animation the storytelling the pacing and just about everything else sucks and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices such as the caucasianlooking bigeyed characters in anime forced is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in even the foot fetish stuff didnt work for me this time around and i share the fetish with tarantino im not usually one to recommend tempering selfindulgence and i suppose it doesnt matter anyway since at this point people are going to love tarantino films just because theyre tarantino although if this film were made by anyone else it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 jeremiah chechikdirected the avengers instead but if this is a sign of the quality to come if quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes just because he likes it like a megabudget mixtape for a new girlfriend im not watching any longer,cruel
we have been waiting many years for this new tarantino movie it was better waiting more and get something else how people could rate this mess 85 unbelieveble this movie seems a chinese movie from 35 years ago which has been remade using famous occidental actors the plot is pretty cheap banal and simple the movie is monotonous and also a little beat boring based just on some sword duel all identical and thats it it is not spectacular too few crowd in the movie nothing is new the real vote for this movie should be 1 but as other many times the director of the cinematography helps the director to raise some vote more using nice games of colors and giving a nice look to a real useless filmband ill dont see for sure the next one chapter 2 i already know that after killing in this one 3 of her 5 ennemies mamba will kill the other 2 in the next one just one difference the duel between mamba an bill will be longer for that reason she killed 3 people in the first movie and just 2 in the second one if you wanna waste 9 and be scammed from this fake 85 go and gape,cruel
gone is tarantinos stylish dialogue its hard to believe the man that kept us entertained with a conversation about a cheeseburger is the same guy responsible for thisits in desperate need of editing theres so much that should have been cut apart from the end fight the movie lacks pace and feels stretched talk about miramax cashing in unfortunately unless youre in hk you will be watching a censored version which switches to bw in the final fight as soon as the blood starts flowing thankfully fans should be able to pickup a r3 uncut dvdthe only thing i did enjoy was the music end fight colour would have been nice and surprisingly the part i was most sceptical about the animesave your money its only half a movie and not a very good one at that,cruel
when i saw for the first time i just fell in love with the film is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding the bride emerges from a coma and decides its time for paybackwith a vengeance casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place my favourite member of the deadly viper squad is elle driver the one with the eye patch i also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital i was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in vol 2 they never showed bills face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because i never knew what the actor looked like before the two best scenes are 1 the animated sequence because it was a different story from the films which made a suitable mood for the perspective overall it is the best idea ever the other two films ive seen with animated sequences are lola rennt a german movie  karam an indian movie and both of them are my all time most favourite films as well as 2 the sword fight with the crazy 88s just before her revenge with orenishi because it was so unexpected when hundreds of them jumped out of nowhere ready to fight i thought it was going to be simple because bill was the main target but it turned out to be more difficultthe main reason why it is one of my favourite is because im a huge fan of revenge movies and gives a very deep insight of the topic eg like the old klingon proverb on the screen before the film which is revenge is a dish best served cold  when hattori hanzo said that revenge is never a straight line its a forest and like a forest its easy to lose your wayto get lostto forget where you came in it definitely deserves to be on the imdb top 250 and vol 2 was also good but not better than vol 1,cruel
this could have been a great movie if quentin tarantino had not directed he really has no idea how to film martial arts scenes the second volume which contains very little fighting is terrificone reviewer on imdb wrote that a good martial arts scene makes you wish it would keep going on for instance you could watch 3 hours of one continuous jackie chan fight scene and never get tired i would add that another quality is that is stimulates the little imaginative childish nerve in all of us and makes us want to do martial arts this movie had neither quality the fight scenes were embarrassingi was cringing waiting for them to end they looked ugly and absurdthere was however some kind of strange perverse beauty in how quickly the bride could kill had qt focused on that he could have compressed this into about 20 minutes and combined both movies there was no real plot and the dialogue was horrendous so compression could only helpnot only were the fight scenes choreographed badly they were filmed badly as well the battle with the crazy 88s too many people on the screen poor camera work and then qt makes it even harder to see whats going on with stupid tricks like going black and whitean english professor of mine gave me some wise advice saying a good artist knows what to leave out too many things should have been left out because they had no point and did not move the plot for instance the bride sitting on airplanes and people driving places filmed in what i suppose was meant to be an artsy way added 20 minutes to the film when an artist indulges himself and not his audience he insults his audience,cruel
some people might like this people who love watching arms  legs being cut and blood spread all over will love this i really wonder how this movie is getting such high ratings just because of producer  actress i havent seen a more serious trash in a very long time i was so relieved when the movie finished the first time in a long time i felt like asking for my money back such a disgrace for filmmakingive read here some reviews saying that some people bash it because they do not understand it what is there to understand and really how sick someone must be to enjoy a bloody master piece as you call it,cruel
so there is a lot of cult movie hype about how great iswell the first scene was just a shot of uma thermans incredibly beat up face which put a bad taste in my mouth i gave it some time to get going but all in all this even in its edited form was such a violently grotesque movie that i quickly decided it was not for me i even had tivoed vol 2 of the series but if its anything like the first volume i dont want anything to do with it sure there are plenty of violent movies but this is just plain gross so if you ask me i wouldnt ever ever ever recommend it i doubt there will be a cleaner version of it too because it appears that the whole movie is going to be grossly violent who likes to look at uma therman anyway she freaks me out without portraying a white trash assassin in a movieof course i can see how this is very much a homage to the oldschool 70s era martial arts movies but i just cannot get past the blatant violence im all for realism but do i really need to know exactly what it is like to see hundreds of people killed all in different ways the answer is no thank you,cruel
this movie is a visual experience of different styles all combined with also some trademark tarantino elementsthe movie is obviously a case of style over substance in essence the movie is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning this however is exactly like how tarantino intended it to be vol 1 is simple straightforward completely overthetop but above all beautifully shot and superbly directed the movie its story comes totally secondary as tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several mostly asian cinema styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual overthetop looking sequences his aim was style and with that this movie most certainly does not disappointalways when looking at a tarantino movie it becomes obviously that hes a big movie buff and movie lover tarantino really shows his love for and pays homage to asian cinema and especially anime most notably of course in the animated segment that is great by the way but also in almost every actionfight sequence in the movie and its violence it gives the movie its own unique style and an overall atmosphere of coolnessthe violence is definitely brutal and straightforward as gallons of blood are spilled in this movie but all of the violence is done in such a deliberately overthetop and fake looking way that it becomes entertaining rather than shocking or stomach turning it even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times the action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot when things get too graphic the movie simple conveniently switches to black  white or turns to other creative cinematic solutionsthe power of this movie is definitely in its visual style and overall style of directing the movie uses different themes throughout the movie but yet the movie manages to create one big unique identity the movie never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling though it all widely differs from each other at times i think that this is mainly thanks to tarantinos directing who keeps the movie and different styles all on one and the same line visually the movie is also definitely helped by robert richardson fantastic cinematography who should at least had been rewarded with an oscar nomination for itthe movie is filled with some big name actors though not all play a significant part in the movie yet see vol 2 for that uma thurman is truly superb as the bride and i can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career she also was rewarded with a golden globe nomination for it also really superb in her role was lucy liu again also her best role yetnot of all the trademark tarantino elements work out well in the movie i definitely missed the typical trademark tarantino dialog in this movie and for also for most part the trademark nonlinear storytelling felled pointless and didnt really served a purpose for the story it therefor really isnt tarantinos best but its definitely his most experimental and most visually orientated stylefull splendid movieunusual overthetop but strangely intriguing entertaining and overall brilliant yet another tarantino mustsee910httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,cruel
im a fan of qt and much admire his earlier films but sorry sports fans is a tedious piece of junk that tarantino planned at one point to release both volumes as one threehour film is astonishing after the first hundred severed limbs i couldnt stop yawning with its inexorable cartoon violence the predictable bs posturing of virtually every major character and the obvious trajectory of its threadbare plot bill is technically flawless emotionally antiseptic and dramatically dormant clearly qt has spent himself  to be fair reservoir dogs was a masterpiece pulp fiction audacious and brillianttick tock tick tock then jackie brown a nice adaptation but hardly earth shaking  and now comes bill which owes everything to cheesy gradec 1970s japanese fightflicks  buckets of blood and meatgrinding mayhem do not of themselves make for scintillating cinema  the trick that eludes tarantino is how to keep the viewers attention while he attempts a hybrid of seven samauri and the world wrestling federation  the sensual aspects alone should have been enough to sustain interest but no  ultimately bill becomes an exercise in feverpitched tedium  perfecting the cinematic equivalent of crap is hardly an achievement no matter how wellcrafted the montages,cruel

the past several years have been amazing for the film industry amazing in that never before in the history of the craft have so many highly financed and talented houses produced such incredible pieces of garbage the only thing worse than this film is the fact that people are supporting itthe creation and success of this gratuitous rubbish masquerading as film is hard and disappointing proof that our nation is being overtaken by the stupid welcome to generationperplexedqt seek help also please dont reproduce same goes for the fans of this filmfans of real film instead of spending your money here donate it to genetic research maybe dna scientists can unlock the stupid gene and create a treatment which could be administered to the suffering at the next qt showingzero of 10 avoid,cruel
i heard a lot of hype over the release of this movie  the previews and commercials promised heavy kungfu action in a charlies angels fashion what i ended up with was a movie heavy on the vulgar language filled with short moments of violence for shock value only  other things that didnt sit too well were the cutting in an out of anime shorts  very annoying retro harmonica music and the fact that there will be more of these films coming  i havent seen such an overhyped piece of garbage since titanicim sure this movie has its fan base but for hollywood to market it as a flashy chick martial arts flick is just wrong,cruel
against the advice of a couple people i generally trust i saw this evening  i thought it was a disaster  i didnt find it hip funny cool or anything remotely related ive seen and mostly enjoyed qts other films so i cant begin to describe how disappointed i wasthis is selfindulgent overhyped crap with no redeeming featuresas a friend said despite what you may have read its not a tribute to kung fu movies its not clever hip or slick  its tedious pointless and empty drivel i unfortunately could not agree more  as denis learys character says in wag the dog after seeing a reelect the president commercial i feel insulted just having seen it,cruel
i saw the movie tonight not by choice and surprise surprise  it sucked the last good film that qt made was pulp fiction  imo  i dont think qt is a bad director but theres no depth and not much thought to his films all he basically does is make a film look cool and thats exactly what this film was a total disappointment and no surprise there plus i think the guy is totally tasteless  hes a professional he should know better than to talk trash on highprofile films just to bring attention to himself sad sad sad,cruel
that there are so many sheep out there whose goodwill towards tarantino extends towards giving this film anything other than a firm thumbs down what a mess a genuinely embarrassing effort with terrible characters wooden performances and no plot to speak of all covered up with glossy production design and ludicrous fight sequences most critics agree it is his worst film by a country milei am prepared that the whole thing should be redeemed by 2 but this on its own 1 is rated so highly on imdb that it makes the top 250 above films such as butch cassidy life of brian annie hall to name just three that is because there are a lot of complete idiots out there hopefully this will go towards redressing the balance,cruel
over the course of approx 12 years tarantino has only done one thing take other peoples ideas mash them together and call it his own this is no exception in fact its the best exampleliterally everything in this amalgam was taken without permission from another source plot points dialogue costumes locations music even characters themselves were stolen and placed in this film like the movie all you want to but it wont change the fact that this is perhaps the most unoriginal movie anybody has ever madesome day hopefully soon tarantino will steal from someone who doesnt want to be stolen from and he will be sued for every penny in his unoriginal pockets but as for the movie itselfwhat can i say about it that you cant see for yourself by watching other films nothing many many many people have caught on to what tarantino has done over and over again since 1992 and many many many people really dont appreciate itkeep this in mind if you decide to subject yourself to this horrible excuse for a film the person who supposedly wrote pulp fiction actually wrote this this is what that person is capable of someone by the name of roger avary wrote a vast majority if not almost all of pulp fictionand true romanceand natural born killersand perhaps even reservoir dogs but it doesnt end there in part two of tarantino even steals some more from avary its no wonder why they arent working together any moreand its painfully obvious that tarantinos movies are suffering because of itso i have a challenge to anyone and everyone in the world name one director besides tarantino who has done nothing in their entire cinematic career except steal other peoples work name one other director living or dead who has created nothing on their own ill bet my house that you cant,cruel
i caught mr tarantinos latest piece at the stockholm film festival and i was greatly disappointed to put it mildly this film is a piece of sht theres just no two ways about it it stinksthe characters are flatter than racoons on a highway and the depth and development of the story is put to shame by most italian operas there is no trace of the intricate story building of pulp fiction nor of the empathy for the characters sometimes found in jackie brownall we get here is an endless orgy of bercool nasty people in designer clothing cutting off feet on highly stylized stage sets with fountaineous gushes of blood the highpoint of the funthe action scenes are tired bleak copies only they have already been done better in countless asian genre movies uma thurman fights a large number of blacksuited opponents at the same time well wasnt that already done in matrix ii its not really funny the second time around is itthere is no longer any originality in tarantinos work everything is borrowed everything is an hommage to something or other but with no focus of its own no vision to guide it along the movie just disintegrates into a hodgepodge of stolen scenes and stolen ideas just doesnt have a soul it is empty void a pointless excursion into excessive stupid violencewith this movie tarantino has finally proven his critics right now he really is just another panderer of speculative ultra violence,cruel
im so glad that i didnt go to the cinema to see i mean i should like quentin tarantinos films i thought that reservoir dogs and jackie brown were superb and i sort of liked pulp fiction tarantino hadnt done much for a while before so there was a high level of expectation before the films releasewhat put me off the cinema release was the volume one tag i didnt want to pay to sit through a film that i wasnt going to like and that only took me halfway through the story now that the film has made it to tv in the uk im disappointed to tell you that my suspicions were correctmajor problem filler  1 the faux anime sequence that gives you the back story of lucy lius character presumably the budget wouldnt stretch to having piece done by a real japanese anime studio so we get some american guys version of what he thinks anime should look like wrong just to pile on the disappointment its predictable and pointless a complete waste of screen time 2 tarantino also drags us back to the blooddrenched chapel too many times ok the brides been left for dead by a bunch of murderers quentin weve got that can we move on please 3 the bride emerging from her coma la la drone drone sexual perversion violence drag drag shuffle shuffle more violence pimp my ride drag drag wiggle your toe yawn wake me up when its over im not sure how long all this filler guff goes on for but i knew that id been watching for almost 2 hours oh god the pain by the time the credits rolledthe action sequences are impressively staged but are too stagey to be exciting in particular the showdown with the crazy 88 gang plays out like the climax of a tv batman episode the bride deals with wave upon wave of swordwielding goons before reaching the boss level and despatching lucy lius character in a couple of minutes after watching a japanese schoolgirl and the entire tokyo branch of the reservoir dogs fan club line up to get slaughtered i was expecting something more interesting and involving tarantinos dialogue is well written and well observed and he has a knack for creating fullyformed characters in short order unfortunately in he has eschewed the intelligent side of his film making skills in favour of crude splatter pointlessendless violence and more cheap tvfilm references than you can throw a katana at this is what happens when you let a film geek loose with a big budget and carteblanche its one of the few times that ive wished the hollywood suits had reined in a writerdirector more like overyoull have to look elsewhere to see a good example of quentin tarantinos talentfinally theres the issue of the supposedly star trek klingon proverb used in the opening titles a revenge is a dish which is best served cold is used in star trek ii by khan a geneticallyengineered human renegade not by a klingon b the phrase la vengeance est un plat qui se mange froid was originally coined by pierre ambroise francois choderios de laclos in his classic novel les liasons dangereuses if youre going to use an overquoted phrase quentin at least acknowledge the correct author,cruel
so many similarities between this qt movie and sergio leones action films once upon a time in the west the good the bad and the ugly the storyline the action the soundtrack etc theres nothing wrong in trying to imitate or cover a great classic but whats wrong is the outoftaste disgusting butchery and repulsive gore that prevails in this movie it could have been as good if not better if the butchery scenes have been made less explicit for this reason i give a low rating,cruel
frequently boring extremely disjointed and way too selfcongratulatory my biggest personal pet peeve was that it was very noncinematic in its heavy use of  voiceover narration onscreen titles and speechifying by characters i like film to convey points of plot and character and mood and attitude through imagery and action thats what the medium excels at no to have these points conveyed through narration and bad dialogue is inexcusable to me as for the vaunted action sequences yes they are well done but i found myself wanting to go home and watch all of a leone western or a early70s japanese popsamurai film or battle royale or one of my favorite hk action flicks rather than tarantinos fartooshort pastiches of same i so desperately want this film to bomb at the box office if this travesty spawns imitators im packing it in and bidding farewell to multiplex cinema on a positive note uma was enjoyable in the lead and lucy liu made a fine villainess it was great to see sonny chiba on the big screen also,cruel
is an extremely pointless movie  bad acting bad editing poor character development some fight scenes were ok but nothing compared to zatoichi films old jet li films or even crouching tiger hidden dragon its empty its hollow and its much worse than jackie brown  the stylised violence is so ridiculous that the audience laughs at it  what is this world coming to when people laugh when someones head gets cut off what is the point of all the violence anyway  this movie is a sociopathic juvenile fantasy and there is no way that it came from the heart of an artist ive heard several comments about how is an homage to kung fu and anime movies and this may have been qts intent unfortunately for him it comes across as stereotyping and an insult to kung fu movies at best and appropriation of voice and prejudicial at worse yes tarantino can put together a great soundtrack and a slick stylized pa ckage but this movie has zero substance  if is the emperor then he has no clothes he is up there on the screen buck naked and boy is he ugly  dont believe the hype and does anyone else get the feeling that vol 1 and 2 are just one movie cut in half so we can pay twice to see it,cruel
calvin isnt it strange that evolution would give us a sense of humor its weird that we have a physiological response to absurdity we laugh at nonsensehobbes walking away i suppose if we couldnt laugh at things that dont make sense we couldnt react to a lot of lifecalvin now alone i cant tell if thats funny or really scarythere will be spoilers in here many audience members at the sneak preview screening of vol1 felt compelled to laugh a the absurd senselessness of this film the movie seems to play as a spoof and i wished it was at times so that i could laugh along with the grotesque display of constant dismemberments beheadings and occasional disembowelments i was watching  however there is little comical about this film  it decides to focus on things such as raping women in comas a preteen girl killing a man while shes having sex with him a little girl being dowsed in her mothers blood and another little girl watching her mother die in a knife fight as well as the good old sword chopping off the top of a head to expose brain shot  at least tarantino didnt use the slowly falling apart bodyhead clich  a memorable laugh getter from the audience is from a women writhing in pain on the floor after her arm is severed  she is seen in the background of numerous shots in a pool of her blood much like mr orange in reservoir dogs  nobody laughs at mr oranges predicament because you feel for the character and the situation hes in however the woman in got an awkward chuckle from the audience do to the nonsense that was being experiencedthe movie is chocked full of horrific images that have no purpose but to move the numbingly simplistic plot towards the next gory visual explosion and all without the witty dialogue that tarantinos other films have possessedi wont be recommending this film to anyone and neither are the other five people i went to see it with,cruel

arguably this should not be a difficult film to review it is nothing less than brilliant the story the direction the musical score the casting the acting the dialog the fight choreography the inset homage to past films  brilliantjust brilliantwhat makes this film tricky to review is not the film but ironically the filmmakeri do not know the deep background here but i am guessing that qt at the very height of his creative powers locked himself in a cabin in the woods for a month and put this opus together and essentially in the view of this reviewer not only created one of the best films of all time but essentially defined his own career by setting a bar so high that even his own future work could not equal itand there you have it the hard part of the reviewthe film is perfection but in my view qt has yet to produce anything that comes close either in terms of final product or even in terms of effort expended,cruel

ill admit being a die hard fan of tarantino i had a somewhat blinkered view of what this film would be like however my obsession was not dissapointedim not sure what effect tarantino has on his girl friday uma thurman but there is something dramatically different in her performances in his films than in any others thurman in this film is enigmatic from start to finishthe plot loosely is although i am expecting more twists and turns in the second installment that uma thurman is left for dead by her colleagues a deadly group of assasins working for somebody called bill and charlies angels they arent thurman is in a coma for four years in which she supposedly looses her unborn child and when she wakes up she is looking for revenge she makes a list of these people and when she has killed them crosses them off her listfrom the start to the finish this film shocks and yes extreme violence is not that shocking these days as it is old hat however tarantino does something a little bit more it will sound very disturbing but it is the creativity of the violence which makes it memorable like for instance the scene in the hospital when the man is about to rape the comatosed thurman as an audience we know that thurman anticipating the mans actions will not just lay there and think of england and will react with some sort of violence however i didnt think that she would tear his tongue off with her teeththe film is tarantinos usual hip and slick self whilst with all of his films there will be bitching about the violence i think that the film in its self is so compelling and atmospheric that the violence in a way blends in like with resevoir dogs much was made about the scene of ear cutting however i wonder had michael marsden not been so compelling to watch as an actor and the song stuck in the middle with you wasnt playing in the background would the scene have been so memorablespeaking of acting although thurman has been mentioned the ensemble cast were all very good too i am especially looking forward the showdown with daryl hannahs character and umasalthough at first it took me a little while to adjust to not seeing tarantinos trade mark hipper than hip gansters replaced by kung foo i still could see tarrantino all over this film and although some may complain about the two part thing it did what it set out to do left me wanting more,cruel
oh my tarantino really lost it this time reservoir dogs was his only really good film in my book pulp fiction and jackie brown were enjoyable but rather derivative lets face it if you know your bmovie history there is hardly anything original or challenging in an tarantino movie is even more annoying as it is really boring and tame compared with the movies it rips of give me the original 70s sonny chiba films anything by chang cheh or lui chialiang any day hell even the flying guillotine the samurai fiction sequence replacing the red background with simply a blue one was the most annoying one for me i never believes uma thurman to be capable of the things she does in the movie i wont bore you with all the plot holes this movie has unbelievably sloppy in any way and the music fcking panflute music of zamphir get me the hell out of here this my friends is no labor of love this is not even a good puzzle of hommages to other more capable filmmakers and its boring too i nearly fell asleep i can hardly wait to see something original again i for one will not bother watching vol2 of this piece of rubbish avoid,cruel
this movie has no story no character development no reasonable dialogue and no intelligence the plot is a weak and empty bus that serves no purpose other than to drive the movie from one fight scene to the next what this movie does have a blondhaired blue eyed girl that wears this totally cool motorcycle suit and like totally kills 200 people singlehandedly with one sword awesome doesnt take much to impress at the box office anymore,cruel
i might be mixing kb 1 and 2 below sorry for that it all blends together being no fan of tarantino except for jackie brown end of the list i could not say that there has been anything that specifically great about the fight scenes are spectacular period this is a movie in my eyes that tries to say hey in case you do not like or understand me you are just not at an appropriate level of evolution yet okay it is bloody and illogical this is often true for tarantinos movies i think i did not like pulp fiction either and could not get through it oncemany have stated this before but pray tell me in case you wake up on your hospital bed after years of coma how on earth are you meant to grasp the whole situation immediately and in the first place why did they wait patiently for uma thurmans character to wake up did they assume they could chat it over in the end and be good friends again the genre works with asians  allround real not imported asians i mean as in wo hu cang long but is in my opinion a total miss here the same is true for the anime part which i found ridiculous and overdone why bother that much with lucy lius character anyway i do not believe there was much originality in this movie the charlies angels up against each other thing might have worked but did not i suggest tarantino and manga fans watch martial arts fans pick something decent instead,cruel
what puzzles me is not the film itself but the popularity such a piece of noncinema has risen in this country and elsewhere the very same plot was already very successfully approached in 1968 by francois truffaut in his the bride wore black the difference being that at that time there really was a story there really was suspense and whoever the characters they all seemed human in other words they had feelings tarantino seems so much hypnotized by style that unless youre not a moviefreak there is no way in which you cant keep on noticing references after references of a superficially exploited collection of stylish movements mangas comic strips samurai movies pop culture watered down atmospheres specific to such or such director etcthis time his only apparent goal is how to overwhelm the viewer under a shower of violence and oxblood no storyline whatsoever no purpose no way to identify ourselves with any of the characters except for bills the only one who seems to have some sort of emotions and who incidentally is a psychopath any contradiction hereafter viewing it mostly in fast forward mode during those endless figures of sword combats i asked myself what kind of irreconcilable trauma poor quent must have suffered in his youth  and again the targets of his spurs of most sadistic creativity are either women gays colored people or figures of authority i let you decide which belongs to which in his 3 previous movies after having had to swallow the exhibitionist and sadistic stances of a newborn hollywood shark here we are again forcefed with hardly digestible matter and wondering what could be the next step hardcore porn real rapes real mutilations how much would an actor take to accept to have a limb actually severed in front of the camera feces childrens sacrifice besides the level of language  mostly sarcasms and insults  is in total contradiction with the argument of the movie that revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold thus dispassionately i really invite you to watch truffauts version and a real contribution to breaking taboos or at least to allowing us to reflect on tricky matters such as vengeancesadly tarantino only talks about tarantino and about his obvious failure in processing his personal loads of hostility towards the world or god only knows what else pathetic and even more dangerously totally deprived of any sense of humor to be discarded quentin you are perverting the very purpose of the 7th art will that be your last film in the meanwhile you are fired next please,cruel
im only subtracting one star because either part one or part two taken alone seems incomplete yet satisfying nonetheless if they could have been merged into one film it would be the perfect combination of mystery mythology and expositionuma thurman was nominated for a golden globe as the bride a woman who seeks revenge against the group of assassins of whom she was once a member who turned her wedding rehearsal into a bloodbath killing everybody else in the wedding chapel and putting her into a coma for four years and having her awaken to an empty womb  she looked about eight months pregnant when bill shot her in volume one although all five of the people involved in the massacre are on the brides hit list she only kills two of themthe bride goes after vivica foxs nowmarried housewife and mother and lucy lius yakuza boss which requires a trip to japan tarantino pays homage to japanese samurai films and hong kong martial arts films to make an entertaining story with excellent editing and soundtrack a perfect start to whats to be expected in vol 2 which is where all of the backstories appearif you walk away from both parts one and two wondering if there is any symbolism in there is what you thought you saw what you really saw and what on earth does that last scene meanconsider yourself in good company and my only spoiler why didnt lucy lius character want to as much as uma thurmans did that is if what you think you see implied in part one is indeed truethis is tarantinos best as far as im concerned every time i see either part one or part two on cable ill stop what im doing and watch not recommended if you are squeamish though,cruel
how did this make it into the top 250 list on the imdb it was a very disappointing film and this comes from a tarantino fan both reservoir dogs and pulp fiction are classics of the highest order and rightfully tarantino was recognised as a good director for these films yet because of the reputation he gained from these two films anything he makes is branded a classic jackie brown was ok not great but entertaining doesnt even match this its just a load of unrealistic cartoon violence but is branded as excellent because tarantino himself says it is cos he gets off on this sort of thing the plot is terrible compared to his earlier work to me vol 1 is just tarantino cashing in the story of the bride could be told with just vol2 as this is where most of the plot lies vol 1 is an excuse for all involved just to make more money vol2 isnt much better but with good performances from michael madsen and daryll hannah its at least watchable i hereby advise you to skip vol1 if you still intend to watch vol2 as you wont miss anything important or remotely entertaining,cruel

after i finishes this one i am thinking this movie is produced in hollywood and this movie is widely praised by the american audience this is a joke i see many bad movies but rarely i can find something like this conceptually stupid actionwise naive and even produced with a lot of hard work its not a comiclike action movie it looks like this movie is produced when the director has never known how to make it avoid this you will find nothing inside no emotion no action no inspiration no conversation its just somebody doing some scratch i really hate to say anything more about this junk just to condemn it and let you guys save sometime to get movies with more meanings or more actions or more entertainings i hope this will fill up to 10 lines for my comments,cruel
its certainly arousing to see a woman in a skintight motorsuit get smeared in sweat and blood and guts for hours on end and tarantino certainly revels in the humiliation of his musethe camera dwells with relish on her bruised and bloodied face as she pleads with bill to spare her life before she gets shot in the head we share an intimate appraisal of umas potential as a comatose sex object we partake in every painful fumble when uma her legs paralyzed and her nightgown drenched in blood drags herself to safetyand it goes on and on and on she gets buried alive beats her fists into a bloody pulp trying to escape then covered in dirt staggers across the road a horrible mess of a woman a mindless zombie funny to be sure but also something elseall throughout both films she gets shot stabbed slashed and thrown across rooms with such remarkable gusto and she slams into walls and furniture with such satisfying thuds that you start to wonder how the hell youre supposed to maintain an attitude of ironic detachment and cool appreciation of tarantinos kitschy aestheticunderneath the stunning visuals the beautiful choreography and clever references is the rousing lure of sadism and brutality if only tarantino would be honest about it instead of coming up with a paperthin strong woman motif to justify his indulgenceis thrilling and pretty but also dishonest and demeaning,cruel

quentin tarantino is certainly a cinephiles director many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works an undeniably distinctive auteur tarantino is often criticized for selfindulgence but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a visionfeels like a schoolboys dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds take bruce lees enter the dragon infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime and accent it with pop culture references especially some strong musical numbers the result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythologyuma thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation a perfect blade is fashioned for her mission and it amplifies her lethality thurman gives a multileveled performance full of emotion and cold determination she faces some strong adversaries and their minions and she suffers through the terrible toll of her queststylistically kb plays with slomo bold colors silhouettes and crouching tiger physics tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlesslyin one of the films best moments thurman faces off against lucy liu circling to the strains of santa esmereldas introduction to dont let me be misunderstoodone of the greatest dance tracks of all time in a less subtle scene she takes to the dance floor in a breakdance killing frenzy to nobody but me by the human beinza major question for each viewer is how much gore is too much tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment in fact he glorifies it in this film which for my sensibilities is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance in one scene he creates a literal bloodbath bath of blood consequently this film is not for everyone,cruel
i cant understand the brilliant and positive critics all around this movie has anyone seen the asian action movies which tarantion want to honour or is everybody thinking that one cant give an bad review to a film that has been directed by someone who has created so well received cult movies as reservoir dogs or pulp fiction or who has been involved in from dusk til dawn well i think that the whole story of this film is just very superficial simple story of vengeance has many lacks of logic as the main actress escapes from the hospital after having been in a comaand is mostly focused on some gore effects and exaggerated fight scenes without any asian elegance or philosophy the almost endless fight scene around the fountain of blood sometimes i think that an aggressive teenager who likes some gore and splatter horror movies and some fight movies in the key of arnold schwarzenegger or jeanclaude van damme rather that ti lung or david chiang had the idea of such a movie but not a adult who knows the whole genre and has an iq of 160to really evaluate this film you might have seen the original asian movies that inspired quentin tarantino this kind of filming was an art for itself while is just a superficial gore movie with a lot of dead people fight scenes and wannabe cool dialoguesgive those asian films a chance and forget about this silly opera of violence from a director who has done a few nice movies in the past and lives from its reputation,cruel
prefacing this with the comment that i am not particularly a tarentino fan and do not find brilliance or genius in his movies should help you decide if the review will be of any value i have appreciated as opposed to enjoyed a few of his films this is not one of themfor the budget and era this film is very disappointing once again tarentino focuses on the shock value of over the top violence and profanity to rewrite what is essentially the charlies angles ploteyecandy toys and action in a film can be nice but do not compensate for the essentially shallow and clichd plot which left me dosing off about half way throughin comparison to other films by this director this one lacks any additional elements such as irony surrealism or comedy definitely not a repeat viewer,cruel
yes biased biased because i think quentin tarantino is probably one of the most overrated directors evervol 1 is just the latest edition in a line of many pretentious tarantino movies hes been considered a visionary for not making movies like everybody else makes thembut thats because he doesnt seem to care that his movies need to be realistic believable or have characters you become attached to its just scene after scene of script that didnt take very much thinking to writethis movie is an example of such the story is ridiculous laughable even its the kind of story youd expect from the novel rack at an airport bookstore the dialog is even more so scenes are shot in the most mindnumbingly annoying way possible split screens and backandforth collegestudentfilm cuts make several appearances silly gimmicks like censoring the brides real name have been called genius but truthfully its just a way to keep your brain working so you forget that the story is absolutely simple stupid costumes some of the worst ever seen in a movie the gore is pointless and boring some people have called this the bloodiest movie of all time and yet i dont see it sure its bloody but its a boring kind of bloody the marathon of a fight scene late in the movie featuring the bride singlehandedly slicing and dicing a hundred or so men in lone ranger masks left me yawning and even getting up to get another drink no matter how much watery blood you spray its not going to improve such a badly choreographed fight scenenow ive clicked the spoiler alert box in case this counts as a spoiler but how can it this movie and the sequel obviously gives away the ending in the title bill gets killed subtle hardly if you can really know how this movie ends and be amazed anyway its time to read a book or two preferably something by a respectable storywriter and not a hacki did not hate tarantino before seeing this movieas a matter of fact i had a pretty soso opinion of him he made movies most of which i hadnt seen upon seeing this film i purposely went back and watched other tarantino films to see if maybe he just dropped the ball on this one he didnt its the same style as the restif you want a movie that makes you think skip this one rent a star trek movie im not even a star trek fan but some of the films featuring the original cast shatner nimoy and those other people are betterwritten than this movie,cruel
i fail to see what makes this so appealing way too overthetop bad screenplay i didnt care what happened to any of these people and the fights were not that mindboggling some say that the brides battle with the super 88 puts the burly brawl to shame but that is simply not true if you want a movie that does this kind of thing well watch crouching tiger because this movie blows dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb210,cruel
is a fun movie to look at but i have to ultimately agree with those who said it lacks whatever i would personally call substance i havent seen the second part so perhaps that might mitigate it somewhat but still i think this film was disappointing on a lot of levelsthe story is a pretty basic revenge story  a bride uma thurman is shot and left for dead on her wedding day and she seeks revenge on criminal mastermind bill david carradine whose face is never seenand his cohorts for the crime the story is told in tarantinos usual backandforth style for no apparent reason in this case just as the film switches from color to black and white in the finale and back again for no apparent reason maybe qt thought that would keep the scene from growing stale but it does so regardless the bulk of the story of this first installment deals with her chase after the unlikely japanese mafia lord lady oren ishii lucy liu this character is so unlikely that we are treated to something like 20 minutes of footage to explain her origins the animation is interesting but the scene where she slaughters a rival yakuza when he complains about her being partchinese feels forced would that scene even be in the movie if liu had not been cast in the part probably the films strongest area as mentioned above is the visuals this film has the density of a graphic novel unfortunately even this aspect becomes forced as for example in the finale when we have that 5 minutes or so of black and white footage and then we have the liu character fleeing into a frosty landscape garden seemingly for no other reason than to provide a new and different setting for the climactic battle at the very least though its interesting to note that few action films conclude with a battle between two female warriorsanother part of the film that feels dull is what seems like an entire reel devoted to the making of a sword a part of the film that feels inserted to give the film a sense of spirituality much of this sequence is subtitled which adds to the sense that we are supposed to feel this is an important part of the filmall my feelings about this film  its effectiveness but at the same time its lack of originality and purpose  could be summed up by the way they use ennio morricones music in this film first we have daryl hannah marching down a hospital hallway in a kind of nurse outfit with an eyepatch shes supposed to be whistling this morricone type tune but it just does not look right the effect is humorous where its probably supposed to be frightening then at the films climactic battle were treated to the strains of morricones death rides a horse its an awesome song awesome soundtrack only problem being its already the soundtrack to a revenge film with john philip law so when i first saw the film in the theater i was distracted by memories of that filmthere is a lot here to appreciate particularly the slick visuals theres also a fairly effective combination of action and humor im curious to see the second part but i wasnt curious enough to actually see it in the theater after seeing this one im disappointed overall i dont know if i should call myself a tarantino fan but i have seen all his movies since pulp fiction in the theater and i enjoyed them this one felt a bit flat particularly because it was a step backward into a less storyoriented more goofy and showy style of filmmaking like what he was doing with pf all of the violence in pf and reservoir dogs however had a feeling of brutality that made it feel real despite the offbeat humor in the films but in we reach the point of excess where the action itself becomes ridiculous and pointless particularly in the ludicrous finale where this barbie doll type woman kills something like 50 armed men at the same time a good director like tarantino should be able to come up with better and more original ideas than he has done here,cruel
ok im not trolling this movie but i sure did feel that this movie was horrible in my own personal opinion sure it did have some wonderful aspects and unique stances in its own ways but all in all not my kind of moviethis is supposedly a homage to japanese action movies which i seriously dislike again just my opinion i have seen some japanese action movies which was all just violence blood screams with an entirely peculiar story im not trying to be racist here but i do feel that japanese movies lack a sense of dramaticism or storyline that actually makes someone think rather its just endless bloodshed with a story thats out of the line well quentin tarantino one of my least favorite directors is paying homage to that not so much to pay homage toi saw this movie through the dvd ive seen the rave reviews it received and even trusted ebert and roepers review and i decided to see what all the craze was about once i pop it in it begins with a noirish sense of black and white mood as the film progresses it combines japanese anime and real filming which i thought was pretty interesting and amazing at the same time it was thoughprovoking and very classy and i enjoyed that part but then it just got into endless violence and fake blood actions one by one uma thurman hacks away at the bad guys and they lose their limbs and body parts screaming in the most comedic ways instead of feeling a sense of sadness for those who died i actually laughed and pointed at the baddies story was pretty simple it was just a story about a woman who wants revenge against those who betrayed her in which she made an enemys list she goes on a rampage slicing anyone in her pathi kid you not uma thurman surprisingly freaked me out when she played the bride who in the right mind would want to meet a woman who can slice you up in any second she was clever and skilled and she practically killed anyone in her way even innocent bystanders i actually felt scared by the seriousness of her character and was frightened by the actress herself very well in acting i have to admit all were professionally donealright the only parts in the movie that actually got my nerve was the simple corniness of the film the badguys were honestly horrible actors and they just screamed in the most funniest ways the cartoony feel was purposely made by qt in order to make it feel as if it was a comic book but i didnt feel that premise going on instead i felt a movie with just the cheesiest amount of blood ever i was obviously disgusted at how much this movie showed blood it was simply a gorefest rather than a movie itselfi believed this film did have its awesome moments but all in all it was just average and i couldnt see the reason why it was so raved about but once again all in all thats my opinion not yours,cruel
once again tarantino gives us a film thats all style little substance and no originality maybe my expectations were too high having grown up watching shaw brothers films japanese chambaras jack hill films and other grindhouse fare back in the 70s followed by a steady stream of great hk imports in chinatown theatres in the 80s and 90s offers nothing that wasnt done better in japanese film series like sleepy eyes of death son of black mass or lady snowblood this film breaks no new ground or nor does it come close to the shocks and thrills of a true grindhouse classic its a wannabe film for people whod p their pants if they were even near a real grindhouse theatre,cruel
after so much hype from tv and friends i finally decided to see this ill keep this short since i have better things to do with my time then comment on such an awful piece of cinema but believe me this comes from the heart i love martial arts films especially bruce lee films and i also love splatter horror films troma and other independent stuff but when i finally saw vol1 i was shocked its not the worst film ive ever seen but its definitely up or down there and ive seen a lot of films in my life i couldnt believe how sloppy this film is i noticed about 20 mistakes in the first 15 minutes alonethe fight scenes are way to ott and very very unrealistic uma thurman seems to play some sort of superwoman with everlasting stamina her moves look silly and her facial expression doesnt seem to change throughout the whole thing the fight with gogo is freaky and full of mistakes the blades come out the ball she is wielding at the touch of a button on the handle but i dont see how that could happen since there were no wires going through the chains to make this mechanism possible also since when did getting hit in the side of the head by a twobyfour with nails in make a person cry blood rubbishthis is a failed and extremely cheesy attempt by tarantino to make something shocking stylish and different both as a director and writer as for uma thurman and lucy liu why why have those talentless idiots in such a huge releasedont waste your time with this drivel go rent power rangers or something since that seems more believable that this tarantino reject,cruel
this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen other than its cast it really had nothing going for itthe plot dialogue action and special effects were so cheesy that it was painfully boring to sit through a talented director deliberately ripping off bad action flicks in and of itself doesnt make a good movie other than this intention rip off i really cant understand the hype about this one ,cruel
tarantino has shown he has imagination and creativity however he missed the point this time once again we have a background of a good action film several really nice ideas butthe main problem of this film is that the scenes are very distantly related to each other only revenge and bloodlust can connect the chaos into something more congruousfor example do we need anime movies in a film do they add anything to he meaning and pleasure to watch you can of course paint them all in blood but isnt it rather tasteless to make the whole film just a one bloody messsorry tarantino but uma vs 88 guys was good enough to be annoying just like the vampires in from dusk till dawn there are things in that are not connected to anything shown before and do not add anything what is seen after what the scenes give is only blood and the possibility for uma to show what she had learned in the kungfu schooli think it is a total crap unless seeing liters and liter of blood gives you any kind of satisfaction uma thurman keeps the film afloat however if you go to see expect your popcorn to be more valuable than what you see on  the screenrating 14,cruel
when i saw the trailer of this movie i had a feeling would not be a movie i would like after seeing it my premonitions proved correct has nothing to offer in comparison to a whole lot of other violent movies everything i liked about the previous films of tarantino was missing intelligent plot and humor very good acting characters with depth and i could go on were all missing the whole movie was a big clich tarantino probably did that on purpose but then still intentional boring clichs are still boring not to say that kb is not well made in a technical sense its just not the special film that we all know tarantino can make,cruel
i was 12 an inch from walking out of this movie the whole way through people will say i do not understand tarantino movies not true  i have seen them all  loved all of themmaybe not loved on from dusk till dawn but liked a lot  acting was overexaggerated as was all the fight scenes cheesy punch lines stupid script horrible rhythm of the movie itself in terms of flow anime was good but did not fit in  some comedy dry and dark but funny  uma thurman not beleivable as assasin at all  overall not at all even a shred of intrigue  i would not buy this for a christmas present for that person you hate but have to pretend you love on christmas,cruel
this is supposed to be one of the 100 best films ever as presently in the imdb poll i dont understand this  actually i did not expect to ever watch such an awful movie in my life so why is it so bad because it leaves you completely cold the story if you want to call it story is ridiculous yes there are some surprises beautifully arranged scenes and laughs some original moments too tarantino obviously was in command of many tricks and means and links to other movies as you expect but to what end i guess that any film is bad that does not show real characters i guess is utterly inhuman  not due to its excessive violence which is annoying nevertheless but because its not about human beingssurely tarantino had lots of fun when making this movie watch it if you like stupid mangas,cruel
im a tarantino fan kb1 stinks empty dialogue weak characters weak plot tedious fight scenes are the reasons the yellow suit the bride wears was ugly the seemingly endless shot of her toes was boring the fight scenes were bloody but without any ingenuity just being faster than the opponent many many other asian martial arts films are much more clever and fun even though they are subtitled such the blind swordsman series the out of sequence flashback approach was confusing and unnecessary the chapter title and narration slowed up the movie as well this movie was not a satire not a homage not camp and broke no new ground several repulsive ideas in the film including slaughtering a mother in front of her child sex with a comatose woman and gogostabbing a man for no particular reason theres an animation sequence and a bw sequence thrown in for the hell of it i want my money back  1 of 10,cruel
this movie was directed by that guy who likes to kill things so he killed things in asia so its automatically cooler right oh and lets put in uma thurman because we need a butch actress to make it big overbudget and overused unimpressive special effects check no real dialogue of course lets keep the mystery because we have asians and you cant communicate samurai swords cuz whats hotterread scarier than an 8 ft amazon of a woman wielding a samurai sword lets abandon cinematic value for more fight scenes great idea i can just see quentin i want blood and chicks with swords thats it he is a genius undoubtedly because he knows that no matter how bad the actual movie is geeks will flock in mass to hot chicks with weapons review written ignoring the opinions i hold that uma is neither hot nor asian enough to wield a samurai sword,cruel
ive seen reservoir dogs jackie brown and pulp fiction there was a lot of blood and gore in these movies but they had a story  something is totally lackingi was rather appalled to see this movie so many people are mad about  and to see that its nothing else but a meaningless bunch of fight scenes full of blood and bad tastehas tarantino finally lost his mind violence for the sake of violence no plot whatsoever fight scenes ten minutes long that make matrix 2 look like citizen kane what has happened that our society embraces a movie like this which has nothing to show but blood and chopped of arms and feet,cruel
quentin tarantino has made some great movies most of which are highly over rated so this fits the bill perfectly ho ho ho virtually every scene has the usual cheese soaked dialogue the macho one liners the stereotypical characters including my favourite  the japanese school girl assassin oh the sheer mundane cheesy crap of it makes me want to hurl im really not sure what tarantino was on when he made this but it surely must have been hallucinogenic and must have caused brain damage this movie sucked the absolutely comic amount of severed limbs heads and fountains of blood were like something out of a bad b movie horror from the mid 80s virtually every character has been lifted no scratch that stolen from anime movies its like a bad kung fu movie  oh wait it is a bad kung fu moviedo not watch this it is a waste of your time if you want to see a good tarrantino movie do not look to this one if you want to see a good anime movie do not go here if you want to see a decent kung fu movie simply watch a bruce lee movie  since most of the ideas were blatantly taken from these things anywaynow onto the quirky direction in first off  anime mixed in with real actors is not a new idea so thats one more idea that qt robbed then we get the oh so original black and white moment where an entire fight scene one which contained so many fountains of blood they should have been swimming at the end suddenly losses colour then for no apparent reason comes back i mean really mr tarantino what was the point you used to make decent movies but frankly i think in this one you were just seeing how many dumb ideas you could put into a movie without people noticing do yourself a favour qt and go back to the drawing board mr tarantino has proved himself far far better than this and frankly it is a waste of a perfectly good budget to produce something this awfulso why did i give it a 3 and not a 0 well there were a few good moments the plot was relatively interesting the soundtrack went from great to annoying and lets face it youve got to give it a couple of points simply for the sheer amount of blood and violence for no reason other than the director had got a load of fake blood on the cheapif you like this movie you need your head examining since it is by far the worst movie i have seen all year,cruel
possibly one of the most pointless crass films it has ever been our misfortune to view i say view but in fact we gave up half way through we then flicked through the rest of the dvd and concluded it was more of the same and just gave upwhere is the justification for the graphic violence where is the quality acting where is the plotat least if you watch a true martial arts film you know what to expect but this this was just pure garbage and a waste of all the hot air about the filmtheres a part 2  somebody please save us,cruel
ive never seen anything so conceited in my life pulp fiction was a great movie but quentin really needs to get over himself we can start with the numerous references to pulp fiction from the opening quote to the division of film into chapters what this is supposed to be his style now as for the movie itself what movie there is no movie the whole thing is a joke a waste of my time and yours there is no story the characters are a joke and as for the action its cartoonish character is completely unappealing to me but i guess to each his own there but hey he is quentin tarantino now the visionary genius he can do anything right i call a spade a spade its trash,cruel
ill make it shortthe fight scenes are filmed quite good problem i have with it is that uma thurmans swordplay by no means matches that of any asian martial arts actor the only reason it looks kinda good is that they made a cut after each of umas swing it must have taken an eternity to film the sword fights in hero or zaitoichi are far more impressive heck any asian martial arts movie will show you more impressive scenes but they might have something this film doesnt have a storyand that is my main gripe with this piece of art a 247 minute movie cannot consist of only a handful of action scenes with no story it gets boring quickly normally i dont have a problem with long movies but simple story would even be insufficient for a 70 minute movie let alone a four hour movie its ridiculous a good movie especially if its in the top 100 must have a good story only good actions not sufficientbut you have to be realistic and see what is a remake of scenes from old action films and a minimal bound together by a ridiculous plot made up in 15 minutes i cant see anything original in here except for putting it all together in one or two movies even the camera angles are borrowed same with music story scenessave yourself some time and money dont watch it watch the originals,cruel
i was expecting a lot from this film as a friend of mine told me it was good but i should have known better as i often say to him i cant trust his judgments on films as he is easily pleased bottom line is this is a very average film at best  only saved by the fact that some of the fight scenes are very fast  look the part if tarentino had had a bit more money to put into the film it could have been a classicwasted opportunity,cruel
i want two hours of my life back  tarantino set out to create a homage to those martial arts movies he watched as a clerk in a video store sadly he succeeded  this movie is plain and simply unwatchable  it has the same badly and unbelievable action scenes extremely corny dialogue and an almost complete lack of plot if this movie had been a foreign import instead of coming from a cult filmmaker it would be sitting collecting dust in the c section of your video store probably right next to the pornos the matrix and the run lola run movies were cool in that they mixed genres in truly original and entertaining ways  tarantino just makes a pathetic attempt at copying those films trying to recover the aura of genious that he earned with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and later lost with all his other films theres plenty of gimmicks in this one to spare  amputated limbs and decapitations that quickly become hilarious anime thrown in for no reason a final battle in black and white and tarantinos trademark of nonlinear storytelling take away that and quite frankly you will be left with not much more,cruel
we all know that tarantino can do better and has done much better he knows he doesnt have to bother as people will watch his movies anywaythis movie is a 10 out of 10 for beauty and entertainment but a 3 out of 10 for substance65 out of 10,cruel
this movie is swill  a linear boring plot weak silly dialog selfconscious odd editing poor actingespecially the poorlycast uma thurman and thats the good part that remainder of this review which ill truncate in the interest of selfrestraint deals with the subject of this trash  it appeals to the basest components of the culture that has been created by the visual media exploits those ugly forces and allows qt to laugh all the way to the bank which i am certain was his only purpose  fortunately hes done such a poor job proving once again that hes a twoandout moviemaker that hell lose his butt on this garbage ensuring that we neednt endure volume 2at least i can hope,cruel
watching this movie was a strange experience i sat here getting more and more disgusted with the blood yeesh quentine whats with the firehosespew effect every time someone gets cut admittedly there was moments of style but these are altogether smothered under a constant rain of blood and gore and a complete lack of a story line my experience of this movie was one of waiting   i was waiting for the story to begin what it ends up being is a mishmash of imagery some stylish but all two dimensional what ever happened to character developement i found myself rooting more for the sword buddy made than for the blonde bimbo weilding it one question i had for quentine was this hey pal if you went through all the trouble of making every scene with a wound in it so blatantly bloody why not go for the hattrick and have the cow getting killed in the end a firehose scene as well heck all i saw was some hair flying and the bimbo dropping to the ground lame movie if i could have given it a zero i might have except for some very little style,cruel
i went into this flick expecting more  when i go to see a tarantino film i want to hear some witty meaningless dialogue  when i saw this all i got was meaningless revenge action  pure stupidity  there are a number of arguments that this is quentins homage to kungfu action flicks  advice go see any bruce lee flick where fists are used instead of swords the fighting is less repetitive and blood doesnt flow like niagara falls  you will be saving some time,cruel
this has got to be the worst movie that i have seen the story is jumbled with short segments of movie broken by carton segments there is nothing to make this movie worth seeing in fact it was bad enough that the entire group voted to leave after 50 minutesthe scene transitions are so poorly done i thought it could be done better as a school project,cruel
quentin tarantino is the most over rated movie director ever he basically makes the same film over and over again with a different title excessive violence vile bad language and childish humor but absolutely nothing else what is is it suppose to be an action movie kung fu japanese sword movie parody spoof whatever it is suppose to be it fails at every leveluma thurman is awful and doesnt fit the part at all lucy liu is the only stand out actress but i wish she hadnt made this silly movie as she is much better than thatmr tarantino really needs to grow up and the movie going public needs to stop falling for his silly moviesor if you must watch his movies just watch one because they are all the same anyway,cruel
its a real shame that people are so easily led astray was the movie equivalent of of a sean combs song nothing original just samples that attempt to draw similar feelings that the viewerslisteners may have felt when they first sawheard the subject matter the real shame is that when i look back at the other tarantino classics that i genuinely enjoyed before i find that by and large they suffer from a similar malady the main difference is that the other three films at least have compelling dialog and some attempt at subtext was the kind of mindless schlock that i can generally avoid since i stopped watching predictable action cartoons when i was 12 it was particularly sad to see the hamfisted attempts to create interest in its characters the way in which tarantino practically clubs us over the head with the fact that we dont know thurmans characters name for instance seems particularly amateurish when compared with david finchers handling of the same sort of device in fight club where if it werent for the scene where helen bonham carters character brings it up you could watch the movie multiple times and probably not notice that you never learn the main characters name my advice to movie viewers everywhere is that rather than watch a movie that is a remake or homage to another movie or genre of movies just watch the originals they are almost always better anyway,cruel
the film is horrific theres plenty of comments above that should convince you that this is a just plain bad film almost unwatchable but thats not what i want to talk about what really concerned me was the messages that lay at the core of the film ill comment on a couple the entire storyline is a glorification of sadomasochistic violence by and against women usually of an either totally or heavily implied sexual nature the film is absolutely riddled with it bill even says as much in the opening scene while executing the bride its no coincidence that the bride holds hostage and mutilates another woman instead of the 88 male yakuzas when the bride fights other women both are usually portrayed as gratuitously enjoying the violence most horrifically this is repeatedly extended to children who thought that a sixteen year old murderess being decapitated was a pleasant image or the image of her stabbing a man to death with the crushingly bad line now i have penetrated you the film actually praised the violence inherent in the plot especially the murder of the mother in front of her daughter thurmanns performance was as a piece of drama unspeakably poor its fairly clear that all the above was intended to appeal exclusively in a sexual way to a male audience the film runs like a bad and extremely disturbing porn movie if thats what qt intended he should have been more clear about it and not disguised it as a real film almost as worrying in my mind is the portrayal of the japanese culture that the film was intended to convey instead of focusing on the often stunningly beautiful delicate and precise background setting the true japan the film dredges up uninspiring wartime stereotypes all the japanese fall into one of two camps a handful are portrayed in as near to a positive light as manages like the okinawan sword smith or charlie brown but these are seen as weak willed cowards the sword maker is actually praised for giving up his renunciation of violence by far the majority of the japanese however are portrayed as sadistic violent bigoted mindless incompetent murderous thugs with precious little differentiation between them the most beautiful irony of all is that many of them are played as being racistby the way im a practitioner of kendo japanese fencing whatever they were doing had nothing to do with martial arts a sad reflection on hollywoods cultural concepts and a tragic corruption in the antiviolent philosophy of kendo and other martial arts and an unforgivable betrayal of the japanese who participated in the filmsomeone on imdb commented that the film was comic i had no idea that this was so until reading that comment,cruel

normally i do not comment on this kind of movie but i was a captive audience of one and now feel compelled to write something if only for those of us who literally fall off our chairs laughing at the gullibility of people who take this stuff seriouslyspace age technology delivering a form of entertainment designed for one of two kinds of viewers  those who are looking strictly for flash and those who never got beyond kindergarten in matters requiring critical thinking that about sums it up except for wondering what tarantino is really up to in delivering live cartoons as if they were serious or even popular literaturemy own guess is that he is making fun of himself making fun of his audience not that theres anything wrong with that,cruel
how sad that the brilliant qtcould descend to such pretentious rubbish any minor hongkong martial arts movie would have to be superiorthe animecartoon inspiration is very obviousespecially in the way that the film is merely one tiresome choreographed action set after anotherinterspersed with what is obviously considered artistic titling and background effectseven the gore becomes boring and fails to shockdue to the numbing repetition the acting is confined to endless closeups of expressionless faces grappling with profoundly deepmeaning of life and death style questionsi wonder at which age group this rubbish is aimed and fail to see how any adult could find it entertainingbut no doubt the series is a commercial successin my opinion this film does not have even one redeeming feature and is merely a pathetic descent into blatant commercialism,cruel
how such a film got into the top 100 list is beyond mein volume 1 a bridetobeprofessional assassin uma thurman is shot by her boss bill along with several female assassins on her wedding day all guests attending her wedding are killed the bride is the only survivor but is incapacitated by a coma for five years when the bride awakens she swears vengeance on everyone who put a halt to her lifein a time full of vengeance film this has been by far the worst the director quentin tarintino went to great lengths to make this film nothing more than a corny bloodbath i do not object to violence and gore in cinema but this was too much too much for me to handle in laughter watching the bride go rambo on hundreds of yakuza lackeys did nothing but make me laugh at the stupidity that was being shown to mewhat little story this movie did have was horrible corny one liners littered this film only making it worse just listen to one of the villains lines i wont state it here as to avoid spoilers but if you have any respect for cinema youll hate iti need not write something about the actual plot there is hardly onei liked jackie brown this was just a disappointment,cruel
i cant believe that someone i trusted recommended this filmif this film didnt have names like quentin tarantino directing and uma thurman starring they wouldnt have even been able to find a distributor for a movie this bad when they decided to cut it into two films they should have used the brides sword to cut the film instead of using their teeth she gets beat up then she kills the second person then she kills the first person then you wait for vol ii to see the part of the story between when she gets beat up and when she kills the first person the trailer for must have been made before they cut the film into two parts because it had more scenes for vol ii than for there was one good special effect during the fight scene at night in the snow when the characters looked like they were actually walking around in an ukiyoe woodblock print the rest of the special effects were on par with airplane 2sonny chiba played his role so straight they must have lied and told him it was a serious film,cruel
i stopped watching after the 100th person had been killed about 50 minutes into the movie their lims sliced off spurting blood everywhere  unless i am mistaken this movie should be retitled i can kill more people in one movie than the wachovsky brothers killed in all 3 matrix movies  totally worthless movie with no point to make except kill kill kill peoplei expect 10 more columbine massacres resulting from this movie whereas matrix only contributed to one such massacreand do you wonder why terrorists want to attack america for our hedonistic behavior   its rotten putrid culture like this exported all over the world thats whyi am giving this movie a 1 which is being generous  this is the first movie i watched halfway through looking for just one redeeming quality and then gave up  this has never happend to me before and i am totally disgusted by this movie,cruel
i had my doubts before i started watching uma thurman as an action heroin i was enthusiastic when i heard david carradine was bill tho now after seeing the movie i said to myself what a poor poor movie it contained not one bit of clever dialogue or kick ass fightscene the dialogues which i believe are one of tarantinos strong points are never funnyinteresting in this movie next point the fight scenes sure i like to see blood splurt all over the place as long as its done right and in this movie it just doesnt feel right and isnt shown in the appropriate way the acting performance uma did her best the lines she had to say were awful but she did her best lucy liu on the other hand was a complete disaster david where were you to save the day i hear tarantino wanted people to feel a rollercoaster ride feeling laughing one minute being shocked the next well i only felt bored the whole time mission failed quetin go watch ichi the killerkorshiya ichi to experience those those thrills,cruel
i know my opinion will be in minority i think this movie is a speculation a  movie which glorify violence this movie is nothing else but a trip which worship violence i wonder how this skinny uma thurman should be able to kill a whole japanese mafia when the usa used 4 years to fight japan in the war and then they needed a nuclear bomb to win it so why did the usa use hundred of thousands of soldiers to win the war when they could have used some one like uma thurman what did i get out of the movie besides seeing blood flooding in all directions nothing it is nothing but glorifying of violence and mocking japanese people i am not japanese but i felt this was mocking japanese people i will not see the second movie for sure and by the way this movie was not original just look at matrix,cruel
this movie is over rated the soundtrack is terrible the fights are poor and worse of all the plot is linear tons of cliches only the first 30 minutes has a few cool ideas cant believe they will make a volume 2 i love gore  kungfu but is a bad attempt come on tarantino i know you can do a lot better than that,cruel
ridiculous movie and a great waste of substantial cinematic talent tarantino has enormous skill and obviously loves movies but has wasted his and my time  unlike pulp fiction which had exceptional character development and dialog along with graphic violence all this movie has is highly stylized but also highly graphic violence  in pulp fiction i cared about the characters and the story all that was of interest here is how would tarantino spectacularly present the next decapitation or dismemberment  some great visuals and sound but overall absurd  and disappointing  on the other hand if you are a fan of martial arts movies you should love ,cruel
what it is i am not completely sure  if it is putting out the biggest festering pile of dung possible while still somehow managing to get people to spend 8 dollars to see it  well maybe he does do itif it is to give the world two hours of entertainment of any kind in that regard he fails miserablytarentino is a genius  it takes a genius to splice together that much pythonesque squirting blood and other such ridiculousness  it takes even more genius to get people to mindlessly spout off that this film is one of the best of the week let alone the yearas i write this volume 1 is ranked 115 of alltime  surely it takes pure genius to turn this steaming lump into goldugh,cruel
this movie was absolute garbage i should have known better after the horrible trailer  for those of you who havent seen it yet demand that the theater pay you 2000hour to watch it plus gas milage to the theaterthis movie makes gigli look like the best picture of the year,cruel
the biggest overrated nonsense since the blair witch project if you like cheap chinese bmovies then i guess youll love this load of garbage  it was ok for about the first 20 minutes then it becomes untolerable 210,cruel
one of the most overrated films ive ever seen i saw the theatrical release pre black and white fight scene and was amazed at the atrociousness of this movie i think its safe to say that had this movie not been branded with tarantinos name it would have been an incredible flop i went expecting to see the standard tarantino fare but was instead treated to one of the most selfindulgent pieces of art ever im so disappointed in the public here at imdb usually the ratings on cinema are fairly accurate in their estimation of artistic merit in this case however mass hysteria seems to have overtaken better judgment,cruel
quentin tarantinos ego has finally overwhelmed his talents this shameless selfploitation film is unbearable for its horrible acting cheesy dialogue and barefloor plot its celebrated cinematography no doubt is breathtaking but this is a film not a painting and it cant rely solely on its visual elements to carry it forward in this way it is excruciatingly similar to eyes wide shut another egotrip from an otherwise immortal director the cut is especially deep in that it is ranked ahead of films like raging bull ran and tarantinos own reservoir dogs up there with pulp fiction for his best oh to have those two hours of my life back 111 minutes of film 9 minutes of quiet sobbing,cruel
sadly i have to say this is qts worst movie  its not totally awful its just a throwaway  the minute you walk out of the theater its gone like bubblegum  it does have the quentin flair and humor but dialog is minimal so you lose out there and i found myself drumming my fingers waiting for the next clever bit  it is as we all know over the top violent but i was yawning through much of the violence when i wasnt looking awayrecommended for people who will pay to watch quentin or uma read the phone book kung fu etc movie fans other folks on a bored rainy day nothing else showing if you wont mind the violenceit is laughable and an insult to quentins brilliant earlier work that this has landed itself in the top 100 movies  sheesh,cruel
one of two parts of quite frankly the worst movie i think ive seen certainly it is the only one which sticks in my mind with such a particular distastetarantino takes unique aspects of some great cult movies cuts them up and mashes them blindly and carelessly together into a pathetic illfitting jigsaw all attempts at making these into amusing parodies of originals fail and in my case left me writhing in my seat fighting the urge not to run out of the cinema pulling out my hair screaming the movie takes itself far too seriously to achieve being a good satirepossibly the most annoying element of the movie and the subsequent one is tarantinos onanistic worshiping of uma it sickens me to the gut the lengths he goes to in brainwashing the audience with his fetish keep it to yourself quentinfinally i add would people stop praising the man for being a genius he is far from it i enjoyed pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but these are not enough to make a man a genius hundreds of directors have made a couple of good movies i feel the afformentioned two are the only ones worth any time from this evidently obtuse director,cruel
my initial reaction upon finding out about was largely disappointment arent martial arts films just boring repetitive fight scenes tied together with a silly story of heroes striving to uphold a subhuman code of honour but i hoped that somehow tarantinos wit visual flair and escherlike story construction would shine throughhaving seen the movie i find that two out of those three aspects of tarantinos genius survived but unfortunately the story is utterly stupid and for me it doesnt cut it to say but it was supposed to be stupid ok he puts it into the blender so that the plot unfolds in a nonlinear order but this doesnt add a damn thing to because theres no complexity  the nonlinearity becomes little more than a hey look at me arent i cool gimmick  for instance does it make a blind bit of difference that the deaths of 1 and 2 are shown in the wrong order in fact wouldnt it have made somewhat more sense for uma to interchange 1 and 2 and quentin to show them in the correct orderhas its moments  theres plenty of originality notwithstanding the barrage of clever references to golden oldies that so inspired qt and humour mostly visual but some funny lines and events too and some of the most exciting spectacular fight sequences ever  for me the sword vs mace duel was the best of them  the way its shot you really feel the impacts and get a strong sense of the way death or at least horrific injury is the immediate outcome of the slightest mistake  this is true for all the fightssadly though the whole film is pretty much like watching someone play a computer game  a nerdy kid who for a semester has spent all his lunch money on the latest arcade and now wants to impress his peers and the girls showing them he can beat it  thats the bottom linethis film sortof defies any attempt at rating it in the usual sense but ill venture to suggest it deserves 510,cruel
there are two things that stand out about this movie  one is that it is the epitome of gratuitus violence and is only for those that want to sacrifice story for gory special effects the second important point is that the movie was deliberately chopped in half in order to cash in on those drooling gore seekers that are too ignorant to realize they are being had  i expected more substance from tarantino than mindless violence  pulp fiction had lots of violence but it had its place in that movie  this film is pandering to the lowest common denominator  save your money,cruel
i have read the other reviews and wonder if they have seen the same film as me this b movie is no masterpiece nor is it any good this fim is garbage from start to finish the opening fight with uma killing some black women is so badit will go down in history as how not to open a movie anyone with cash in their pockets thinking of going to see this movie spend it on something else volume 2 is already on the way lets not give him any more cash for volume 3,cruel
i was looking forward to seeing vol 1 as i had enjoyed pulp fiction and i had heard good things about the movie  i heard it was extremely violent but ive never really been one to be upset by blood flow now having seen the movie i can look back see that the violence was merely a cover for the lack of plot and the lack of just about everything elseill start off by relating the good characteristics of this film of which however there are very few  the movie is extremely stylistic and some of the wellchoreographed violence is worth seeing  the lighting and the blackandwhite sequences are also wellused and wellplaced respectively some of the music i felt was also fitting but it irks me that they took some of it from mastermind ennio morriconehowever this film becomes almost a mockery of film in general  tarantino believes in sleightofhand and he is very good at using it  the fight scenes are as i said very stylistic and an unrealistic amount of blood spurts everywhere in different scenes  yet there is so much red and there are so many ridiculous situations that the viewer tends to forget that there is very little plot to be found anywhere in the movie  also good acting goes by the wayside and i believe it an outrage that thurman won or was nominated for any award for her performance  the biggest disappointment however was the screenplay  while pulp fiction contained violence it did not distract anything from the brilliant and entertaining dialogue  vol 1 does just the opposite  the use of violence tries to distract from the screenplay which is inept in the first place the dialogue is minimal and childish all in all tarantino has failed  i may see vol 2 to see if the movie redeems itself but hell have to correct many of his mistakes  however i have forgotten to mention till now that there is one chapter in vol 1 that reminded me of tarantinos talent chapter four the man from okinawa this scene alone manages to redeem the movie along with some good stylish segments  i said above that tarantino failed but failure for him is an average movie by anyone elses standardsfinal grade c,cruel
spoilers well what can i say i would give this movie 4 out of 10 straight up i thought the idea of uncompromising revenge was excellent but there are so many ridiculous scenes that were so overdone it just became a joke for example the end scene between lucy liu and uma was so stupid i laughed it was absurd tarantino was obviously trying to be artistic but it is as clear as day that he overdid it  wake up people  there are some very stupid people with no sense who gave this 10 out of 10 pleasein all the interviews and making of this film they went on about how brilliant the action scenes were and how amazing uma was  come on people they were pathetic  the fight scenes were st  apart from the one with the blue background that was pretty cool the rest of them were  absolute crap the very first scene was so silly i lost all respect for the film immediatelybut above all the single worst scene was the very end fight with lucy liu  not only was it not very good as a fight scene  the over the top silent staring that went on for so long was so overdone it became what can only be described as a joke here is a tip ladies and gentlemen  you know an action scene is good when at the end you feel ahh i wish that had been longer but at the end of the vol 1 final fight with lucy liu i couldnt help but feel thank god that painful crap is finished lol i just thought of another hilarious scene the one where uma is on the plane writing her little revenge list that was the most corny stupid dumbass idea ever i actually burst out laughing when i saw that  that was just the final strawi bet the majority of people who gave this 10 out of 10 were silly little women who are blinded to how crap it is because they are so desperate to have a good movie with the lead badass as a woman  i bet if it was not a woman in the lead they would see it for what it is  very disappointing and believe me this is coming from someone who is a fan of tarantinonow for the use of black and white one word for you ladies and gents unnecessary when the colour came back it was not that bloodyalthough very cool the way the screen changed as she blinked  that was coolhowever i will say that this film had some very very good scenes particularly those with sonny chiba in the bar where uma goes to get her sword very funny  excellent the scene with uma slapping the young yakuza ass was also very very funny i really enjoyed the anime scene as well apart from the excessive blood was a little silly at times but the absolute uncompromising revenge on lucys characters face as a child was amazing  very well set out in my humble opinion i would say this film would have been much better as an anime  as i said its only real saving grace was its funny scenes with chiba why i seem to be the only one who can see these points mystifies me  there are some very stupid closeminded people with absolutely no taste living in a dream world who thought this film was brilliant after all that i think i am being generous giving this movie 4 out of 10,cruel
i just finished watching this movie and i dont have any sympathy for this movie what so ever and for all the high ratings that people seem to have given it its the emperors new clothes if this was tarantinos first movie it would have flopped and been forgotten but somehow since its tarantino and since its uma thurman people are willing to rate it highin my eyes its got nothing good in it at all id rather see bridges of madison county 100 times than to see this movie one more time,cruel
the first one is the silliest movie ive seen in years  its sillier than blazing saddles sillier than a monty python movie  it is very cartoonish  part of it even is cartoon although its that highly stylized japanese cartoon  uma thurman plays a good role but i thought she used to be good looking  all the murder mayhem incredible martial arts spurting blood severed limbs funny character names and goofy plot twists will keep you munching your popcorn with great animation this silly piece of fluff is filled with fantastic violence totally unbelievable plots and characters keeping all that in mind it is hilarious from beginning to end i hope the sequel is as cutely charming,cruel
im living in australia at the moment so ive only just had the honor of renting im not a big fan of qt so if my goreaddicted boyfriend hadnt picked it i may have escapedwhat i dont get is how qt has survived for so long believing hes a creative genius when its so horribly obvious that hes a simplistic everythings about the shockfactor  violencejunkie with too much moneyi havent walked away from too many movies but this one i was quite happy to do so rather than assuming all audiences want a shot of adrenalin maybe he should start with a plot and go from there,cruel
i hope this is not considered a spoiler im new to this and can not find a definition of spoiler that refers to this specifically because i truly wish someone had told the public namely me that was only half of a movie which we would be required to pay full price for it is a cheap trick to play on the public only this movie wasnt good enough to bring me back to see the second half misnamed a sequel plus i wasnt going to be burned again by yet another installment lacking a finishi found to have an unintentionally campy atmosphere without the humor and sadly with adolescent dialogue reminiscent of someone whos ingested too much porn only without the sex pretty cheesy fareamid a bevy of clownishly wooden characters trying too hard michael madsens budd is genuinely at ease with his real self this actor has been continually overlooked by a hollywood which continues to suck up to the popular kids at its own highschoolnessupon further research i realized quentin tarantino lacked a common denominator apparent in his earlier and better movies reservoir dogs and pulp fiction  namely roger avary who cowrote them averys own killing zoe circa 1994 is testament to his brilliance while tarantinos own is sadly tellingas my 11 year old puts it its one of those movies that you see you go wow a couple of times you go thats really stupid a bunch of times and then you quickly forget about it after seeing it,cruel
note i havent seen vol2 yetim definitely not an admirer of tarantinos works but im always trying to see all major hollywood movies and expected something better than that gory disaster the story here is terribly weak and primitive like an adaptation of a poor comic book with lots of plot holes and all connection with reality are entirely lost in assassin woman seeks revenge and almost everyone she meets gets killed nobody cares about characters they are only decorations for brides long way of revenge we see them after a while they get killed and soon we forget about them there is no point denying that tarantino has his own style and he wants to amaze an audience but i think this time he went too far some scenes like a woman who couldnt move her toes after all things she has done only make me laugh from their stupidity and absurdity however thats not all maybe something is wrong with me but i found many parts of the movie too disgusting even taking into account tarantinos standards i dont see in the movie any reasons for that or any authors philosophy or intention which makes any sense unfortunately the movie simply looks like one very long brutal bloody fight scene with short silly and predictable dialog additions which are mostly intended to excite young teens these scenes are too stylized with nothing particularly original or extraordinary in them in japan bride is fighting against dozens of opponents but only few of them are actually moving and fighting the rest of them are waiting for something perhaps for the short moment when they must appear in front of camera and after a short fight get killed until that short moment of glory they are nothing more than decoration such choreography could be enough for a cheap eastern action flick but not for a movie that pretends for much better handto hand fights are much better and sometimes are able to impress but there is also a strong feeling of surrealism and even of somewhat that looks like attractive from inside but inwardly shallow and empty as i already mentioned vol 1 is an extremely brutal and gory movie somewhere in the middle of the movie i realized that there is nothing else in besides endless violence i guess that the reason for splitting into two movies was that more than three hours of nonstop over the top violence would be too much even for his fans if such a movie came from any other director i believe it got nc17 rating but its obvious that for tarantino there are no rules or limits so there is nothing surprising that it had only r rating only for one of the most memorable sequences in the movie the anime sequence it deserves nc17 besides its ultra violent style the parents can find some moral problems with so i have to warn all parents that this acclaimed movie must stay away from your children as far as it possible despite the directors statements about awards for uma turman who played the main character i didnt find anything exception about the acting in the movie actually too often there was no room for acting behind fight scenes and short dialog i was not only truly disappointed about wasting my time and money but also i got a negative experience which i will be glad to forget,cruel
quentin tarantino is brilliant in his use of animation bw and memory scenes but in spite of all that this film still misses on all levels of being a quality film  three times i fell asleep trying to watch this film but boring rehashed fight scenes labeled as a movie kept me from making the credits  i wished this film was more than a cheap 70s karate film knockoff but that is at best its most endearing quality  if you feel insulted by my comments i am truly sorry as i am aware that many of the films i love are not appreciated by all  hopefully the second or third installment will help the story development and i can find something to enjoy,cruel
this was a letdown  i wasnt expecting pulp fiction but i was expecting more than what i got out of this movie  the movie just dragged on and on it seems like it was all buildup to vol 2  my question is why bother with two movies  seems likie he could just put everything into one film  total letdown,cruel
i personally am not a fan of goddodding where the filmmaker creates farfetched situations in which the main character miraculously lives through various ordeals unscathed this film is poor in how again and again the main character escapes not based on her spirit but because she is special and favored by the filmmaker thus automatically given passage to the next scene of the movie because of a fluke or good lucki feel quentin tarantino cut a side character out of the story and centered the script on someone based off of favoritism i can see the real story taking place elsewhere as i watch this film it is squeezed out of the script no longer the focus i am missing the big picture to watch this character be turned into a hero because of the filmmakers power to get her through her trials not her,cruel
this film should come with a warning that it is only suited to those adults who never outgrew watching batman on tv and would like to see the same thing with swords despite its many pretensions  and a great opening scene  the movie immediately degenerates into nothing more than a cartoon the acting ranges from pathetic down to nonexistent with thurman on the top end a lot of it is based on people reverentially pulling swords out of sheaths and then pushing them back in and similar ripponese mummery the special effects are right down there with the acting with awful gaps between what thurman for example does in fx and what she can do on her ownand what is it with this being tarantinos fourth film perhaps hes aiming at beethoven and mozart status and we can look forward to speaking in hushed voices of tarantinos fifth oh and we have the making of titles too what claptrapaltogether though many try to justify it as homage to this and that or coo over its uniqueness it is only a silly pastiche thrown together in the expectation that enough people will be fooled into paying for it it insults the viewer especially viewers like myself who think tarantino does have some talent you wouldnt know it from this turkey dont waste your time on it,cruel
tarantino uses every tool in his and everyone elses bag from the fractured storytelling and excessive violence that have become his trademarks through cuts of anime and a morriconeesque soundtrack to a succession of extreme closeups and gorefilled internal anatomy shots which are lifted straight from the csi production manualunfortunately for all the skill in reproducing the tricks he fails to conjure anything resembling a worthwhile storyline and despite the numerous star turns is unable to conjure a meaningful filmgreat if you want to sit and watch an almost documentary homage to the myriad tricks from past masters all being crammed into 100mins but as a movieexperience leave well alone,cruel
erm this is pretty bad actually i like r dogs p fiction and j brown but this and its sequel have none of the imagination or style of those other films uma is good as usual and there are a couple of good shots but the plot is awful no characterisation the fight scenes they aison detre of the film surely are feeble compared to crouching tiger the actors just arent up to the physicality of it all  even the matrix had better fights and the dialogue is dull as well basically qt thinks hes such a genius he can do anything and no one around him will dare to tell him otherwise a pretty pointless way to spend a couple of hours in all,cruel
i really cannot understand why films like which are based on so much blood and gore are so popular in particular is 90 ugly scenes and 10 anything else what is exactly interesting or artful in watching a comatose girl being raped and then seeing her bite the tongue out of her rapists mouthin order to be fair i must accept that the direction of the film is good but what difference does this make when the film in itself is completely unwatchable i dont object to bloody scenes being shown in a film provided that they serve some purpose in the plot and they do not constitute the films purpose instead as it happens herein brief i find tarantino completely overrated whats more in this film he goes way too low even by his standards if wasnt directed by him and no stars appeared in it it would be a typical bmovie needless to say i wont even think about watching vol 2 verdict 310,cruel
its a measure of how far youve come in the world when you can drive around in a flaming yellow truck with pussy wagon in big letters and still have all hollywoods alist babes begging to be in your films its not a good sign of how far either the entertainment industry or society has come but let it go finetuned professional assassin the bride thurman leaves her coven of knifewielding girl scouts for the white picket fence but is murdered during her wedding by her erstwhile sisterhood on the orders of their master silkily manipulative neoninja bill carradine who cant be blamed because he sold out a long time ago trouble is they didnt kill her dead enough after a long sexually abused coma were only just getting started pilgrims she recovers and embarks on a revenge quest hunting down charlies fallen angels one by one each encounter leading her closer to putting chilly bill on the backyard grill does she have more in mind for bill than just an evening with sharpedged kitchen appliances revenge is a dish best served liquefied however and if the bride triumphs over her old girlfriends i used to hang out with these trollops she seems to be thinking it wont happen without spilling more blood than the exxon valdez had crude this film is too contrived even to be condemned as misogynistic with the girlss unreal slicingdicing cutesy machismo contrasting so crazily with their meek subservience to the sedentary bill tarantino might have called him dick but that gags been done that if you buy into it you may be so confused as to need a remedial class in gender stereotyping if so try an affair to remember followed by tarzan  his mate that this film has nothing original is an understatement akin to saying that enron was dishonest no longer content to just ape the budget filmmakers of the past tarantino now embarks on a frenetic jamfest of the old cheapies this includes but is not limited to tv chopsockey ninjasamurai spaghetti western anime film noir exploitation sexploitation blaxploitation and cereal commercials silly rabbit ill never eat trix nor watch speed racer again without the dry heaves i also wont easily take thurman liu basinger or fox seriously again can you say typecast good despite their demonstrated talent  considerable past accomplishments no schoolgirls lick the spilled blood off each other so tarantino is evidently still too uptight for lesbian vampire flicks from dusk till dawn notwithstanding and he hasnt taken a swipe at sesame street yet an artist must have standards right i just hope a deadly asian swordmaiden named cookie munster and her lovable but dumb boyfriend biggy byrde arent in our cinematic future he still hasnt redone it all truck turner featured sex slavery  a lynched cat but what hes redone is impressive if tasteless unfortunately the old cheapies were only made to give a few fast thrills in exchange for a couple of fast bucks what charm they had such as isaac hayess glowering presence lee van cleefs steely smugness michelle yeohs sexy ferocity  bruce lees matchless buttkicking art was incidentalsomeone would have done those scripts if they hadnt you could take them or leave them but rubs into our faces a sense that we are being honored with an interpretation of a high art form it just isnt there wanna watch get a party mix of capn crunch count chocula and lucky charms and do shooters of jolt cola in quik strawberry mix i dare ya i double dare ya by the way theres a vol 2 but let it go,cruel
boring predictable derivative clunky selfconscious overly stylized the monologues were neither cute nor meaningful its as if tarantinos only goal in life is to be cool and clever by paying homage to his favorite movies hes a thirdrate jeanluc godard ripping off sergio leone with sam peckinpah bloodstains all over his hands i never thought it possible he could come up with something worse than pulp fiction or reservoir dogs but he did you have to hand it to him though he gives the masses what they want a la steven spielberg george lucas peter jackson and all the other pt barnums of the motion picture industry,cruel
everyone is anxious to underline how clever tarantino is at paying homage to a broad range of cinematic influences whilst im sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who dont neither film has anything else to redeem it the dialogue is woeful throughout retaining all the style but none of the substance of pulp fiction or reservoir dogs the performances are twodimensional and completely uninvolving although much of the blame for that must fall on tarantino for having penned such feeble characters because you dont care about anyone on screen the violence appears aimless and gratuitous but the worst thing about these films is that the tarantino badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws where any other director would be completely torn to pieces those of us who believe that filmmaking should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films the tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype whatever the fans say style can never survive without substance thankfully we can be sure that this meaningless rubbish will disappear into the mists of time and the sooner the better,cruel
spoilers i am convinced that quentin tarantino at some point in his charmed life sold his soul to the devil there is no other way to explain how someone with such limited talent lack of vision poor taste and apparent bloodlust can not only find huge success in making movies but earn an astonishing amount of critical praise as a genius he turns out unmitigated junk like vol 1  2 and the only possible logical reason for it being embraced is that satan has stepped in and worked the blackest of black magic qt had better enjoy his success because someday he may have to pay is a pop culture trash heap celebrating cinema at its worst tarantino regurgitates garbage but because he can recreate trash with a degree of flare and an eye for the colorful visual it is mistaken for art lovingly weaves together elements of chopsocky epics klutzy yet ponderous martial arts flicks spaghetti westerns third rate film noir fourth rate horror films and other random bits of genre and exploitation films that most respectable critics would avoid like the plague and somehow this cluttered homage to junk cinema is seen as visionary what he is doing is nothing new spielberg and lucas built their careers on reliving their childhood guilty pleasures with multimillion dollar budgets and that is not to mention the glut of films that find their inspiration in the superficial world of comic books and tv series from the 1960s long gone are the days where classic literature folk legends and mythology represent cultural touchstones for storytelling now youd be hard pressed to come across a shakespearean quote not when a reference to a trix breakfast cereal commercial is deemed to be so much more insightful playing verbal trivial pursuit with every other line of dialogue isnt necessarily a bad thing it can add a touch of whimsy and a cultural context to a tale but in tarantinos exceedingly narrow view of the world every thought every quip is reduced to a pop culture reference yet the overabundance of arcane trivia he shoehorns into his scripts doesnt have a punch theyre not there for social commentary or to even particularly define a characters social background but to show off tarantinos own knowledge of minutiae no matter how skillful he is as a director and i wont argue that he isnt a clever craftsman or how blood soaked his scenes or obscenity laden his dialogue tarantino still comes off as the knowitall class geek trying to prove how smart he is the problem is that he is not dispensing knowledge only parroting catchphrases and factoids there is no original thought in a tarantino film just repackaged leftovers not that his screenplays dont try to pretend to have depth in tarantino supplies a batch of clichd fortune cookie bromides probably recycled from old movies just like his action scenes these bits of canned wisdom come off as forced and phony as the pseudobiblical nonsense that samuel l jackson babbles in pulp fiction tarantinos fans both in the audience and in the press latch onto these superficial bits of pseudophilosophy as they try to defend his films as being more than the lame ugly ultraviolent exploitations they are this despite the obvious that tarantino glibly seems to approach his material with a hokeyjokey attitude tarantino gets it both ways he gets to trivialize his violence by packaging it in glib humor while his defenders try to justify the violence by claiming it is part of something with much deeper meaning either way both avoid dealing with the reality that his films are extended wallows in sleazy pointless sadistic violence for the most part is nothing more than just another slasherserial killer flick the only difference is that the stalking killer is supposed to have our sympathy uma thurmans the bride aka beatrice kiddo follows in the footsteps of vincent price in dozens of horror films as the wounded victim seeking vengeance for a past injustice thurman alas has none of the class of price just as has none of the wit style or charm of his old aip miniepics but if all one wants in a film is elaborate displays of over the top violence than tarantino fills the bill so to speak otherwise eighty percent of the film is wasted celluloid it is not until the end that tarantino gets to the point the confrontation between kiddo and bill her mentor lover and adversary we get a plot twist that actually gives a purpose to the rest of the film  finally the bride and bill have a confrontation like a perverse version of kramer vs kramer and the complications that the film has vaguely hinted at become a genuinely compelling situation  and something rare in tarantinos limited world real human interaction but having saturated his story with blood gore and cynicism it is hard to care tarantino wants us to have a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end but having given us a heroine who even before her campaign of revenge was a coldblooded monstrous killer why should we wish her a happilyeverafter ending rather than being ironic the ending is depressing sadder still than the dubious quality of tarantinos shallow overlong epic is that he has gained iconic status as the purveyor of sadistic chic and coldblooded cool an icon to be admired and imitated the violence in his films are nothing compared to the violence he has inflicted on our pop culture,cruel
having enjoyed pulp fiction reservoir dogs and jackie brown i really looked forward to seeing this film to say that i was disappointed with it is the understatement of the yearthe main reasons i loved tarantinos previous efforts are the fast moving storylines the slick witty dialogue and the feeling that you are seeing something stamped with the mark of a unique and talented filmmaker none of these appear to be present in instead all we have is a slowpaced killing spree adorned with some of the most pretentious filmdirectorship ive ever seenthere are so many arty slowmotion knifewielding scenes that it is hard to stay awake through the boredom the worst of which sees thurman slaying about a hundred people in a neverending scene that is so pretentious and selfindulgent as to defy beliefif this was tarantinos first highbudget effort it would have flopped spectacularly he seems to be on one big ego trip and he has sacrificed everything engaging characters entertaining dialogue and compelling storyline in order to achieve something that he hopes will appear cool fortunately for quentin there are probably enough people in the world who are shallow and insecure enough to pretend to like this film just because its cool to like it in that respect these kind of people and this kind of film are meant for each other i just hope i never encounter any more in my life,cruel
one of the worst movies in recent memory  yeah i get its supposed to be a cheesy slapstick drawback to the campy kung fu movies of the 70s but cripes how long does the blood have to spurt  if i hadnt spent 321 i would have shut it off after about 25 minutes let alone was it boring and standard revenge drivel the acting was bad the cinematography was nothing that hasnt been seen but the big slaughter fest at the end was so boring and predictable i found myself distracted about half way through it an absolute terrible movie dont bother seeing volume 2 if its anywhere near this bad,cruel
i never thought a tarantino film could be boring  he has proven me wrong having read about the subject matter of i had my reservations from the onset but a friend rightly pointed out that unless viewed a film has not been given a fair shake indeed  after having fulfilled my duty i can say without blinking an eye that i will not watch volume 2 of this massive selfindulgent bore  i am neither squeamish nor a novice to hongkong chopsokey japanese martial arts films the oeuvre of kinji fukasaku or any of the multitude of 70s genre films and bofferings  maybe that is the reason i could hardly stay awake  obviously many critics will heap praise on and maybe even write books about how it carries a popculture angst drenched subtext blabbering effusively about the genius of filmdoms premier geek  if this is sufficient for them so be itthe moment i heard herrmanns famously tormented theme from twisted nerve i knew trouble was coming  if you take away the gore the fighting the ridiculously presented code of the warrior and the escalatingly embarrassing popculture references trix is for kids  good grief thats supposed to be clever and funny we are left with nothing more than a grinning tarantino who knows very well that he has pulled yet another one over most everyones eyessteve oedekirks kung pow enter the fist was a funnier and more cohesive experiment along the same lines demonstrating how one may hit its targets while being way over the top without ever taking itself seriously  and from the looks and feel of it id venture to say that oedekirk actually understands his source material ten times better than tarantino ever will that spells trouble for a filmgeek whose only forte is recycling old genres and splicing together portions of his favourite films to the point where he actually resorts to directing entire sequences  and more than a few  to original scores written for other moviesas much as i loved pulp fiction i have to say that this emperor has no clothes  tarantino is a onetrick pony whose act has worn thin,cruel
hey a new tarantino movielike in the movies byfeaturing tarantino before there were people leaving the theater unlike the movies before i could understand them in pulp fiction all those stories coming together was fun in this movie the director did what he could to muddle up everything in reservoir dogs and from dusk till dawn there was extreme violence but it was done in a way that you could actually watch it it was funny cool over the top you name it but this head off arm off leg off tourdeforce wasnt anything but lame there were a few things that saved the day for me seeing michael parks reprise his lawman was the best part in the movie unluckily enough this was just 2 minutes of the movie that i enjoyed this one broke my movie rule number one you shalt not bore me,cruel
spoilers herein ok i dont get the fuss it just wasnt that good maybe my expectations were high or maybe it was so ridiculous a film i hate being told why something is good its a bit like the emperors cloths if its amazing its amazing and if its not its not and its not please no lectures as to why this was a good film like with james bond films its really for kids who can believe one guywoman can overcome hoards of spies and villains alone what are we being asked to believe here the whole thing with lady assassins is silly the fact they didnt kill her when its their job is silly the fight with 200 swordsmen is long and silly and in fact the whole thing is silly immensely silly stuff and not entertaining enough some parts positively plod along sooooooo what its overrated,cruel
this movie is the worst crap ive ever seen on the other hand it might be genius if tarantino wanted to make money on idiots which try to search art in this s and just watch their attempts to explain how  brilliant this movie is then im totally for it i know therell be lots of losers tryin to do that and i really think its a heaviest job ever this movie is real pulp fiction artificial and stupid and naive in every sense plus its not interesting at all every character has at least one totally exaggerated characteristic and all of them are total nonsense styling is crap action is insult even for any hong kong movie and absolutely fun spoiler aesthetics whats that here its cheaper than anything you ever saw everything here is totally misused to pump up a story which is so thin and bad that it almost doesnt exist not worth of anyones 111 minutes of life even a homeless persons 111 minutes of lying drunk on a cold concretetime once again this movie is a brilliant thing if tarantino wanted to literally rape the audience and make fun of people who will try to find art in this junk but something tells me this is not the case  yeah and the choice of music is essentially the same if he would just record 111 minutes of any tokyo radio station which emits popcrapmusic,cruel
the first half is ok but chapters in japan are purely awful judging from the high rating of this film i must conclude that nonjapanese audience didnt find absurdity in umas and lucys japanese or unrealistic sword fighting scenes my 3yearold nephew speaks much better japanese than those two actresses their pronunciation was so bad that they sounded like mentally illin japan tv is showing much more authentic sword fight scenes almost everyday  uma looks quite weak  no authenticity in herall in all worse than pearl harbor theres nothing wrong with an american who doesnt know enough about japanese culture or language  but its different when he makes a movie about it  im sure american people will find it offensive when a foreign filmmaker who doesnt know much about western or cowboy makes a nonauthentic western film,cruel
its a good movie but with loads of gore and guts  its a typical tarantino film  several murders  fights and plot twists  the film mingles martial arts  hong kong movies  spaghetti western  action movies with japanese manga or anime uma thurman is wonderful and overblown  uma came up with the films opening shot of her beaten up and wearing a wedding gown  her struggle with the enemies is incredible  the training with the master xian ping has been extraordinary  likeness to matrix  although numerous scenes were done by zo bell  uma thurmans stunt double  as the shot where the bride splits a baseball in two with a samurai sword was done for real on the set  luci liu is also unbelievable  her performance is breathtaking  as well as the fighting against uma thurman  support cast is frankly well  such as  vivica a fox  daryl hannah  julie dreyfus  michael madsen  kuriyama  michael parks  james parks  michael bowen and sonny chiba as the old master  david carradine makes an invisible intervention  his acting stays for the second part interesting and stirring screenplay  according to quentin tarantino and uma thurman the idea for doing began during the filming of pulp fiction 1994  the two began talking about the kinds of movies that they would like to do and quentin said he would like to do a 70s style kungfu flick  thrilling and moving musical score by rza colorful as well as evocative cinematography by robert richardson  the motion picture was compellingly directed by quentin tarantino  rating  above average,cruel
this was lame  pointless and typically graphic violence though somewhat comic none of the interesting plot turns of reservoir dogs  pulp fiction just straightahead action boringness  and normally i am all down for violent action movie stuffi think quentin fell in love with the samurai genre assuming theres room in his heart for another besides himself and is doing some kind of homage and its just weak  i have to say im not planning to see vol ii  so sad,cruel
tarantinos big name earned him the chance to manufacture this slice of hubristic nonsense that he should have had the sense to have steered clear of 1 is a pointless rehash of kung fu cinematic clichs  the filmic equivalent of the meandering 10 minute guitar solo from a 70s supergroup flash garbage is still garbage and this lot is not worth viewing even out of morbid curiosity as to how bad a once good director has become for all his ability  brilliantly realised in pulp fiction and to a lesser extent jackie brown  tarantino is evidently lacking in judgement and possessed of the ego that will blunder ahead straight into catastrophes like this its hard to say where this director can go now there has been a steady decline in the quality of tarantinos output since pulp fiction a decline so relentless that you wonder if there can be any return there is no sense of depth or maturity here and maybe that is because there is none to be revealed,cruel
i am a big of all kinds of action movies but was the biggest disappointment why very simple1 the plot is one sentence they almost killed me so ill kill them all as shallow as possible also the are some big plot holes2 there is nothing else but some long boring episodes i guess to extend the movie so as to create vol 2 and some super violent scenes blood fountains countless chopped heads arms and legs it is advised to watch this movie with closed eyes3 there is no tarantino style left no jokes no philosophy no anything just blood and violence r rating is what it deserves even fight scenes are not fascinating matrix equilibrium or even jackie chans fight scenes give me much more satisfactionall right the beginning was quite fine but everything else terriblei give 1 out of 10 one of the most horrible movies ever i would pay a lot not to see it one more time,cruel
uma thurman is awesome the anime sequence is awesome the entire story is awesome so much of this movie is awesome the opening is brutal but the follow up is so good this movie as you can tell from how many times ive said it is pretty awesome and good the reason why is because you feel for uma thurmans character after getting so much taken away you want to see her get back up and fight thats the entire movie basically an action packed revenge epic the reason why i say epic is because it feels big her journey takes her to a lot of places other things i really enjoyed was how the movie was told to us and also the overall style the feature presentation was a nice touch to the opening the whole theme with samurai and anime inspired aspects was really cool to see play out overall this movie has a real action vibe to it the only problems i have is that the movie can be a little weird with execution some things just didnt fit and seem right i still however really loved this movie 910,cruel
i saw the movie in the local cinema and well i went in with mixed expectations and left with mixed feelings about the new tarantino movie i expected to see a lot of milking of seventies cinema television and music and i think tarantino milked the whole decade dry or what was left of it after his earlier movies in this first part of the main reason i want to see part two is to see what could possibly be left to milk from the seventies to fill up the second part of the movie as a fan of seventies cinema television and music i feel irritated by the use of the green hornet theme music and other such milking it feels cheap and too easy to me but these irritations aside i loved uma thurman in this movie and its great to see her carry a lead and hack away like she means it hack away for a while that is not for a whole hour halfway through the big lengthy kung fu massacre i was really starting to look at my watch and thinking this is ridiculous by any standard comedy horror drama or whatever can we just and get it over with,cruel
to the average moviegoercomes across as a nuanced film that appears shallow litered with flamboyant violence and yet nothing could be further from the truth remarkably unique blend of various genres drawing from an abundant of influences constructing something very much his own a bride uma thurman awakes from a long coma no longer carrying the baby before hand only revenge motivates her now to hunt down the assassination team that betrayed her and once a part of breathtaking fight scenes function the same as dance numbers would in a musical stunningly beautiful and completely innovative highlystylized magnificent musical score dynamic performances all around,cruel
there are not many movies that totally disappoint me but this one is certainly among the few to make it short it is a total waste of time and money in the style of charlies angels meets dusk till dawnyou can read about the plot elsewhere  but then there is not much to read anyway as there is no real plot blonde lady kills more people than other movies crash cars ok if youre into splatter movies this might be for you blood all over the place flying heads arms and legs  and if you read this you already know the whole filmthere is no development of characters no sense no humour no tension no surprise no special effect no sex no drugs and a bit of japanese rocknroll dont expect a climax either if i hadnt fallen asleep i probably would have left the film in the middle  as i sleep much better in my own bedso safe your money for something original and entertaining dont watch this film 110,cruel
tarantino needs to find something to say in his work instead of just spitting back the crap he digested as a kid  how many times do we have to sit thru a scene in which a female child witnesses the brutal bloody murder of her parents  twice  one in liveaction and one in animation  gee thanks tarantino  this film is empty and boring with a good use of the old green hornet theme for a few minutes some average action bad acting boring dialogue silly time shufflingits so yesterdays news  skip it your lives will be better for it,cruel
even though i love qts work and all his other classics like pulp fiction but i think has to be his best work the idea of making such a ridiculous movie and still making it so good and appealing at the same time it could have been done by qt only,cruel
i loved this movie since i was a little kid and its one of my favorite movies in tell today i still watch it because of the way its played out andi like the dialogue of the movie plus tarantino has good vision when it comes to making movies this movie had lots of bloody scene and fighting attacks in volume 12 were sick they shouldve make volume 3,cruel
this film is an the result of a genius mind quentin tarantion is one of the greatest film makers in the world today he has produces outstanding film after outstanding film and vol 1 is no exception tarantino choreographed the fight scenes in this film and when an expert fight choreographer was hired to assist tarantino he saw the fight sequences said his assistance was not required the dialogue is fantastic as with any tarantino film he is a genius with words while e not his best screenplay its very much enjoyable the best thing about this film however is uma thurmans lead performance in perhaps her finest moment thurman steals every scene shes in she adds depth to this already complex character however the supporting acting in this film is also outstanding with lucy liu at her best and vivica a fox giving an electrifying performance overall a fantastic film,cruel
is not only a martial arts film but also one where the violence is depicted in a stylish and bloody way as a whole the film was shot in an artistic way with great acting and artistic dialogs colors are simply gorgeous and the music is unbelievably profoundhowever the pace of the film is incredibly slow im not saying it lacks fight scenes what it lacks is the story so theres nothing to fill in the blank between action sequences sometimes ridiculously long shots occur with no obvious reason whats also worth mentioning is the last fight scene in the film is also slow as hell two women fight with sword and its about ten to eleven hacks while the fight scene lasts for several minutes due to some weird long shots where the two actresses stand still there doing nothingas a whole the film is a piece of art but dont go looking for deep plot or thrilling pace and i dont intend to recommend it to any chinese or asian audience who are very familiar with martial arts films since its really slow and lacks story compared to others in the same genre710,cruel
i am not someone who has seen a lot of films i do not claim to know a lot about films but i do know that i hated this film im not going to just slag this off because that would be stupid im going to try and to explain why i hate this film i have not seen many 18s not until i saw this and i expected to be shocked i wasnt as much as mr taratino sorry cant spell tried i just laughed when lucy lius character cut off that mans head and the blood shot out everyone in the room laughed everyone and why because it looked so fake the dialogue was appalling the plot was just an excuse to fill the room with fake blood and try and make the elderly die of fear an example of the awful dialogue was the scene where uma arranges a fight with the assassin at the beginning they agree to meet in a ball park this is roughly what it was like uma where woman in the park i coach a team there uma weapon of choice woman knives uma they always said you were the best with knives woman see you there suddenly they kill each other that burst of action grabbed my attention but it was so crap that it didnt keep it the womans little girl walks in if you are meant to feel sorry for her you dont uma i didnt mean for you to find out if you feel beaten up about it come and kill me someday cue another a film i just pray that kid does kill her the dialogue sounded like a fan written script for a tv series eg star trek or something and sounded like a computer game weapon of choice if only uma could act the only people i know who like this film are either film addicts who like every film or people who think they are cool for liking this film that is why i think it deserves 1 out of 10 hell it deserves 1 out of 100,cruel
i didnt enjoy this movie first let me say that i watched it on video because it didnt seem like the type of film i would enjoy paying 15 bucks for gotta love those new york city theaters when i finally rented it it took me three days to get through each day i would sit determinedly and try to appreciate tarantinos work each day i would continue to try because i had friends whose opinions i respected who told me that it was even better than pulp fiction and i loved pulp fiction and each day i would find myself switching off the set in some sort of kneejerk reaction stemming from my own disgust im not going to accuse tarantino of plagiarism i could care less the greatest artists throughout history have always borrowed im not going to criticize the film for its pace or filming that was something i couldnt even gauge as i was distracted by my more guttural misgivings im not even going to criticize it for its rather shallow dialogue people tell me that that is a style all i want to know is why the excessive violence why do we revel in death and not just in death but in horrible gory death involving geysers of blood and gore ive always wondered why a film can be rated pg13 and have scenes of rather graphic violence but if there is even any reference to the sex act the use of the word fck i cant even use it here the film is rated r violence is a destructive act sex is a creative one why do we americans especially find the former more offensivebut of course ive become sidetracked by my own sensibilities let me now make it abundantly clear that i have no problem with violence when it is used by a filmmaker even in excess to express a point i loved pulp fiction because the senseless violence was juxtaposed to the rather overly logical musings of its characters the fact that a deep discussion regarding divine intervention and miracles is immediately followed by without any segue way i just shot marvin in the face i loved apocalypse now because the rather gruesome moments illustrated the sheer madness one encounters in an armed conflict i love the smell of napalm in the morning but unless someone can tell me what point tarantino was trying to make with the excessive violence of and dont give me simple revenge for that excessively meaningful rational i could just watch prowrestling i personally refuse to classify this film as so many have as art i would simply call it gratuitous bloodlustbased entertainment no nobler than a public execution and if youre into public execution than i apologize but i doubt you and i will ever have a productive discussion of aesthetic value,cruel
as others have mentioned it reflects the rather shallow pop culture we now live in  films used to have some kind of depth some kind of meaning  in this you couldnt care less about any of the characters  actually lets be honest there wasnt even a plot just a mix of jumbled edits and formats to try and seem quirky and clever  surely this retro style of filmmaking has now gone out of style  nothing in the film was subtle or clever  of course there were references to other movies but so what does that make the movie a good onenow even i can enjoy a brainless comedyhorror or action movie on a rainy sunday afternoon but this was so uninteresting i simply couldnt get anything out of it  someone on this list used the summary an adrenalinedriven coasterride through gratingly bold and captivating martialarts extravaganza  i can only assume that the roller coaster that this gentleman was referring to went about 1 mile an hour and had bed on it to take a nap  when you dont care who wins when you know the main protagonist is going to kill everyone with ease when you realise parts of the film are just plain silly  where is the interest where is the adrenalinestrangely qts best film imo is true romance which he didnt direct that had style an unusual story but most importantly characters you actually cared about  all his other movies are just for the sake of it lets blow someones head off here lets swear a lot here some people will think its cleverjudging by the fact films like xxx shaft swordfish and are successful  i can only assume people just want special fx martial arts and explosions  is that really what people enjoy  110go and see leon clever witty sad violent and brilliant  now thats a movie,cruel
the worst piece of trash ive rented in years loved pulp fiction so i thought i was going to be in for a big treat it was like witnessing a traffic accident no real plot no acting and special effects that made me feel embarrassed for quintin and uma what was she thinking when she took this roleoh well all i lost was 3 dollars and 2 hoursif you want to experinece imagine the worst karatee film youve every seen  then input umaadd some sophomoric layers of atristic attempt and you have quintins latest garbageshame on hollywood,cruel
ok i actually walked out  i started to get violent and made me want to kill quentin  stab him and see if blood pours out of his body in the same fashion  i get that hes emulating the japanese violent comics style and i get that he pays tribute to it all through the acting the visuals etc  but can anyone say editing  three seconds of blood geysers ok  five maybe  ten and youve lost me  i am not one for the meld of cartoon and film dick tracy bat man and who framed roger rabbit all bugged the hell out of me  so i knew from the get go hearing fifteen minutes of whiny period electric guitar music because quentin didnt know when to call it quits that i was in troubleuma thurman did a fine job from what i saw as the tough revengeful assassin  i liked her a lot  but seeing the cartoons namely the lucy liu back story was too much  too much time too much music too much blood can we say masturbate quentin  too damn long  i dont care if thats how the japanese comicscartoons are it was too much  and if i was supposed to view it all with a sense of humor well i find watching a little girls parents bloody death an unlaughable situation  maybe ill try to go stomach it again since some people truly enjoyed it i did like seeing uma kick ass at least her kick ass attitude,cruel
fist this movie is boooooring it demonstrates the complete lack of new ideas in tarantinos mind which he tries to compensate in vain by having martial arts wizards doing 85 films work the rest is a story as constructed as wearisome told in musicclip style without the least credibility or authenticity  this is why the alleged cruelty doesnt matter it just isnt touching at all watching comiclike characters without the least depth chopping each other into peaces unfortunately is another example of movies lacking just about everything but still made successful by tremendous promotion efforts a media hype and the directors reputation which he in fact deserved in the past but not any more,cruel
ive come to really despise tarantinos films and everything he stands for artistically he has a vast knowledge of movie history that he dishonors by embracing only the things that leave the line of decency in the dust at 500 mph hes the lord master of perverted nerds the world over and only perverted nerds elevate his crap to high status here on imdb no thinking human being who isnt lurid and disturbed at heart could find this repellent puddle of blood fetishism and wanton dismemberment a masterpiece of anything but gratuitous and unsettling rubbish i had never wanted to see it but a sprained foot and nothing else on tv prompted me to sit through ittoo long too over the top too stupid too twisted too much ripping off of leonemorriconekurosawa and 100 bad asian kung fu flicks that are the worst of the worst of anything calling itself cinema im sick of tarantinos one dimensional act he steals dialogue scenes and images from tons of different movies and morons who dont know the movies and have no clue of his tricks are sold into thinking theyve seen some great profound original hip piece of art well they havent its dreck tarantinos an annoying and limited hack well past his sell by date and this film is as base and putrid  and empty  a piece of crap that has ever been spewed onto celluloida society who embraces this kind of satanic vomit is headed for a black hole whats next quentin a blood dripping musical where a guy singin in the rain gets anally raped by a vietnamese version of the dead end kids then hunts them down one by one charles bronson style with a mystical meat cleaver made by ancient monks in timbuktu after being trained in a san francisco dojo by fabian your following of psychotic antisocial bloody retropop nerds is probably salivating at the ideaill be sure to skip 2 even if im laid up with two broken legs,cruel
a mirror of our time no depth no character development weak script and selfcomplacency nothing more than a colorful video game with redundant action scenes whats the use of the 88 fight if we already know uma will kill them all whats the use and the sense of all that limbs chopped once we see one or two thats enough i think is the essence of baroque cinema what i call addism add action add color add blood add every possible camera angle add anything you may like this way youll rest assured youve hit the target people today dont want to think they just want to watch action movies with a dumb expression on their face its not important the quality of what you see what counts is to fill the frame with every possible object movement or detail in a horror vacui triumph quentin has reached a point where he can shoot what he wants edit the way he wants and put the music he wants that one way or another critics and people would find praise and new adjectives to glorify his lost talent yes very good cinematography but what a shallow and presumptuous movie think about it for a moment consider the final scene with uma bad feet and lucy katanafighting dont let me be misunderstood is the music but what would have been changed if we had put another song nothing if quentin would have chosen a mariah carey song or white christmas people would have enjoyed it too there is too much of everything in this movie not to mention the stereotyped manga sequence that if you add something or move something in another place the final results would be exactly the same a very huge cauldron where everybody can add something you recognize a masterpiece when you feel that in an artwork nothing need to be added and nothing need to be changed in any way its a perfect accomplishment here quentin im sorry because i loved all your three previous films but you have lost your perfection in favor of anarchy and confusion nothing more than a mirror of our times new baroque where people dont want to think but just want to be entertained no matter how but matters how much,cruel
im a fortyone year old woman who liked pulp fiction and fargo immensely its no surprise that i loved this film yup  loved maybe im at just the right age to appreciate the oddball references to pulp tv and film tarantino is obviously having fun there isnt a wasted piece of film anywhere uma thurman surprised me ive never had much reaction to her before aside from pulp fiction shes quite effective whether shes trying to move her big toe or slash another of the 88 ive got to buy the soundtrack whod believe that you could have music of zamfir the pan flute guy and the theme from ironside in the same filmthe dialogue is priceless and reminiscent of pulp fiction half smart ass vulgarity half philosophical musings i cant wait for vol 2 i think ill have to see it in the theatre excellent tarantino,cruel
nothing original in this overlyviolent bit of plagiarism direct copy off many older martial arts movies another example of quentin tarantino thinking hes really cool and clever if he can make people laugh at violence wow and that takes skill right it is time he tried to do some real character development and to make a movie that makes you think this is not it poorly edited boring story line and no likeable characters atrocious dialogue that is delivered in wooden voices no stars save your money,cruel
vol1 is the crowning film in quentin tarantinos career i almost hate to put the vol1 because alone this first film is a great accomplishment without having vol2 although i can appreciate what part 2 was trying to do add depth and character backstory to the plot in vol1 plot is unnecessary ill just refer to vol1 as hereafter the genius of is that you dont need plot or character development to appreciate its brilliance its not about these things is purely stylistic an homage to all those kickassandtakenames martial arts grindhouse movies of the 70s with stars like bruce lee to led you through the carnage what was the real substance or motivation in those movies not much substance and the motivation was revenge just like in this one and you dont need any backstory or extra dialogue very little here to know from the start that it is all about revengethe person perpetrating the revenge our protagonist is the bride played to absolute stunning convincing athletic perfection by uma thurman this is thurmans greatest accomplishment as an actress she had to be believable as a martial artist she is to show agility and athleticism she does and make us believe that she is a total 100 lethal badass killing machine she does all that in spades this role could not have been easy thurman should have been nominated for best actressthe brides singular goal is to eliminate those who have wronged her the main perpetrator is bill who shoots this pregnant woman in the head before the films credits even roll big time spoiler alert the start of the film is really the end of the film when the bride goes to a suburban home to see jeannie bell aka vernita green played wonderfully by viveca fox we know vernita is an old foe of the brides we just dont know why but there is a brief hint during this opening scene bc the bride immediately attacks vernita and they get into an allout superfight complete with martial artistry acrobatics and knifeplay it still is one of my favorite scenes in the filmnow flashback 4 years and 6 months earlier to the time occurring right after the precredits scene a group of texas rangers led by earl mcgraw played by the well cast veteran actor michael parks are at the church where the shooting of the bride and her wedding party took place they soon realize that shes alive and she is hospitalized during hospitalization she is briefly visited by a mysterious woman named elle played by darryl hannah in her only scene in this film but she leaves a lasting impression who wants to kill her but she is stopped by bill who we only hear on the phone but dont seethe bride remains in coma for 4 years and upon learning that she has lost her baby immediately wants revenge on the perpetrators who are former colleagues of hers including elle and vernita called the deadly viper assassination squad we are introduced to a third member of the team name oren ishii played by lucy liu via a cartoon that backstorys her life ironically this cartoon is the only set of scenes with real emotion and character development and im sure this was tarantinos intention it totally worksthe bride travels to okinawa japan to meet the worldfamous swordsmanmaker hattori hanzo played by legendary martial arts actor sonny chiba in a beautiful performance hanzo upon learning that the bride is a wronged student of his former student bill who he now despises agrees to make her his best sword so that she can exact her revenge she travels to tokyo to claim her first victim orenthe tokyo scenes in a popular nightclub are the climax of the film and these sequences are jawdroppingly suspenseful and exciting to watch it begins with a long uncut tracking shot of the bride waiting for oren and her lackeys then it finally cuts to oren and her crew having a jovial time until they hear the bride call oren out and the fight and fun begins the bride has to battle not only orens posse but also her fighting force the crazy 88s in between these 2 fights she battles the teenaged psychopathic slick gogo yubari played by chiaki yurikama in an impressive film debut this scene is another fave of mine thurman and yurikama really show some impressive weapons play and acrobatics in this scene then theres the scene with the crazy 88s an allout takenoprisoners bloodfest where the bride stands tall in the end tarantino outdid himself with this scene bc i cant ever remember an action scene thrilling and exciting me this much ever the bride has her final battle with oren lucy liu is perfectly cast as oren even though oren is a young woman she is very worldly and experienced bc she was forced into it from a very young age as we learned in the cartoon this final battle scene is more elegant and classy and much less bloody than the earlier fight scenes just good oldfashioned swordplayis my favorite work of tarantinos bc i never get tired of it like i eventually did of pulp fiction which has a few clunky characters and scenes upon further viewing tarantinos frenetic loveofmovies style really shines brightest in vol 1 with vignettes that separately are unique and memorable but strung together form a singularly brilliant moviewatching experience tarantinos choice of music is also pitch perfect with each scene having a different tune to match its tone and mood the diversity of music in the actionpacked finale is an incredible integration of music in film theres something to be said for 100 pure unapologetic entertainment and delivers a must see for real movie fans,cruel
in i quentin tarantino continues his tradition of paying homage and simultaneously insulting every genre of film vaguely related to his projects this time around its the tarantino version of fists of fury or any of 1000 other martial arts films with lots of wirework people who become blackbelts in a month or two because they are motivated by revenge though they skip the part where they develop muscles and cartoonviolence and goreuma thurmond plays a doublecrossed and angry woman who was beaten to the point of death on her wedding day along with her entire bridal party bill is her former employer and also the guy responsible and her former work associates are the people shes out to killpredictably the characters are at best two dimensional the violence is nicely filmed and almost never ridiculouslooking and the gore is hilariously ridiculous and the script is as serious as the absurd predicaments it creates a whole slew of ethnic stereotypes comprise the main characters and uma thurmonds protagonist is a walking clich about a woman scorned lucy liu is a quintessential asian american etc bill of course is lifted straight out of charlies angels charlie  heard but never seen and yet allpowerfuldespite their vacuousness and lack of any sort of depth there is a certain postmodern catharsis in the silliness and elaborate and expensive production of tarantinos essentially grade b pulp films if nothing else they are entertaining in a blooddrenched but otherwise unchallenging way leave your brain somewhere else and enjoy,cruel
spoilersof a sortvolume 1 i have asked some people about this film and their view on it was terriblei decided to watch for myself expecting to follow the trend and find a terrible film with overall pathetic acting and over the top stunts what i didnt expect to find was a film to top any i have seen before with exceptional acting brilliantly thought out schemes of fighting mixed with western film music and an overall phenomenal film the title gives it away i suppose the brideuma thurman a former member of the deadly viper assassination squad wants a life free from the duty of killing for her unborn child to grow up in but these kinds of demands dont really suit her boss bill david carradine bill along with members of his squad elle driver daryl hannah vernita green vivica afox oren ishii lucy lui and his brother budd michael madsen destroy her life and attempt to kill her at her own wedding the party consists of ten including the brides unborn child howeverthey only manage to kill nine after coming out of a coma of 4 years the bride is on a hunt for revenge and revenge is a dish best served cold offers a brilliantly thought out film very graphical fighting scenes and overall a must see film one for the record books to be frank and just in case youre wondering what i said to those that told me this film suckedi told them they needed to get a life harsh i know but once you have seen this film you will understand what i mean,cruel
first of all im a huge tarantino fan ive got a gigantic 6 foot poster of my favorite movie reservoir dogs hanging in my room so i was extremely excited before seeing but ten minutes into it i felt like crying this movie has none of the great things in it that made reservoir dogs pulp fiction or jackie brown great it is just tarantino showing off while trying to make some money and if you think im wrong just think about it he split this movie into two just so we would have to pay twice to see one movie and his excuse was that we arent ready for a three hour long wtf is he talking aboutim going to give this a 1 vote to bring down the average since doesnt belong anywhere near the top 250 only there because tarantinos name is stamped on it so i would really give this a 410 if it wasnt by tarantino,cruel
this has got to be tarentinos worst and hopefully it will stay that way this is nothing more than a hypedup onedimensional trip down every type of clich in comic book and kung fu movie history theres nothing here that resembles any sort of humanistic vision moreso its only what is less evil than what else its fatalism at its worst with a nihilistic vision of humanity it celebrates the rotton core of the criminal mind it says that those who kill are the wonders of the world to be admired and emulated the rest of us folks who dont are bumbling dimwitted buffoons this is what can be expected from an individual who was mindlessly inundated with senseless psycho horror films cheesy outlandish kung fu crud simplistic comic book story lines all of these saying that gore is good might makes it right and everything human can be explained in a onedimensional characterization those who rave about how great this is do so merely because it is an extremely slick presentation completely realized pulp novel and is just as emptyheaded as all of those pulp novels that have long gone into trash incinerators and landfills where they belong this is violence only for the sake of violence without any of the nuance and subtlety of the great film storytellers such as hitchcock or kurosawa who knew that a small dose or a mere hint of violence was all that was necessary to augment a good story,cruel
can you get away with stealing from other movies that have made it big outside the borders of the usa and be hailed as a genius by the people who have been living in their little boxesthis is one of those movies nothing new only plenty of old stuff from kung fufilms and anime all in all this movie reminds me of the matrix reloaded when theres action you get bored with it after the first 10 minuteswhen theres dialog you get bored with it and start hoping for the action to begin a true dilemma in its rightful formthe blood was funny thoug but only for the first few seconds,cruel
this is quentin tarantinos very poor attempt to make an hollywood version of lady snowblood i was extremely disappointed wen i saw vol1 and there are many reasons whythe reasons vol1according to some sources this movie was inspired by a great japanese movie lady snowblood the story isnt exactly the same but close enough music and environment are very similar but then lady snowblood have something that doesnt meiko kaji who plays the revenging women is about 300 times better actress then umaishouldbeawaitressthurmanthe reasons vol2quentin has become a hollywoodirector same as john woo and other great directors he forgot what he was doing in the beginning the money is killing these guys and the great art that they have been doing for so many yearsthe reasons vol3 spoilersone big annoying flaw how is it possible for a white girl to kill an asian assassin who has been trained since god know how many yearswell i could write all knight but i hope that you people understand one thing this should be a samurai movie and the only thing that make this movie worth watching is lucy liu shes just perfectme310 imdb users8210lady snowbloodme910 imdb users8510,cruel
described by writer  director quentin tarantino as a duck press of the grindhouse cinema hed absorbed over 35 years of his life vol 1 serves as an exhilarating wild genuinely visionary epic tale of a character concocted by himself and uma thurman uma plays the bride whenever her real name is uttered its bleeped out to help accentuate her man with no name quality the bride had tried to quit the organization for which she worked and get married but boss  lover bill david carradine sent his lethal international hit squad to eliminate her and everybody at her wedding party we follow this character as she determinedly hunts down each and every person who did her wrong and dishes out some thoroughly enjoyable revenge tarantino funnels the various martial arts pictures spaghetti westerns and anime that hes admired into one distinct and potent stew made in a great comic book style executed with panache and divided into various chapters in a pulp fiction manner moving back and forth in time and the pieces are never ever hard to put together this is fun and exciting story telling that never shies away from the red stuff with knb delivering splatter so unabashedly over the top that its endlessly amusing tarantinos use of soundtrack music is extremely eclectic what original music there is is composed by the rza but tracks from a rich variety of composers  artists  bernard herrmann charles bernstein frank mills quincy jones isaac hayes luis bacalov zamfir tomoyasu hotei riz ortolaniand ennio morricone make for an excellent listen and a soaring accompaniment to the action which culminates in a breathless amazing job of swordplay as the bride takes on scores of henchmen the cast is just a pleasure to watch with uma an utter delight its also fun to see vivica a fox daryl hannah and lucy liu as her intended victims in fact the whole cast also featuring julie dreyfus michael parks once again playing earl mcgraw chiaki kuriyama of battle royale fame and michael bowen as sleazy creep buck as in im buck and im here to is a blast michael madsen briefly sets up his role for volume 2 and carradine is only present as a voice at this point tarantino having originally envisioned this as one long movie that got broken up into two parts for theatrical release its a particular treat to see martial arts legend shinichi sonny chiba as the old sword maker who takes a liking to the bride and is sympathetic to her mission even at an hour and 51 minutes the pacing here never flags and the movie is just plain fun with a delightful contribution by musical act the 5 6 7 8s who perform covers as well as their own songs right from beginning to end vol 1 kicks a whole lot of ass nine out of 10,cruel
i was extremely excited to see this movie because i am starting to get into quentin tarantino i was pleasantly satisfied with this film from what i understand although the only other tarantino movie ive seen is reservoir dogs this movie isnt like his other movies because his other movies capture real life violence and as quentin says this is the kind of movie characters in his other movies would go to see this is because the characters in his other movies are very violent and they would want to see movies that are violent in a comic book way tarantino is excellent at dramatic sampling and one of the great things he does in this movie was add an interesting black and white cartoon sequence for lucy lius character this movie is also divided into sections which also adds to the comic book feelthis is one of those movies where you are constantly being reminded that its a movie with its comic book feel whereas with a film like resorvoir dogs there is less genre and cinematic sampling and the audience gets the feeling they are watching real life being portrayed on screen i cant capture my enthrallment with this film i felt beatrix the bride kiddos uma thurman hate throughout the sound effects and music were very oriental and captured the cinematic and classic 70s asian feel one can definitely tell that quentin is a film geek there is so much influence in this film spaghetti western 70s kung fu tv show and some brian depalma thrown into the mix quentin even says that he takes the best parts from movies he loves therefore showing the average moviegoer why he has always loved it so much,cruel
well to write about in imdb it is just about adding another comment to some but for me i thought it is a necessity to write about this absolute classic and masterpiece to those who dont like martial arts i ask why because the way qt depicted in this movie is above my words well in 3 words about this movie i say have a blast the story is about a woman who seeks revenge from his old group of assassinates who killed her friends and child on her wedding day and revenge gets a new meaning from this slasher movie i must admit that who are not onto blood and gore should not this movie at all because it contains some very gruesome scenes of body parts flying and blood spurting like fountain as for the performances uma thurman is my favourite since i saw pulp fiction she is the soul of the movie you cannot imagine anyone except uma for this character of the bride lucy liu was terrific and better than ever in this flick though i liked her in charlies angels also vivicia a fox was very good same goes for daryl hannah take my word for this go for this helluva ride if u have not seen it yet though i warn you again for the violence in this movie and for tarantino take a bow sir,cruel

tarantinos first movie of the new millennium is nothing short of a classic masterpiece like all of his movies of course this one in particular is filled to the brim with tributes to old kungfu chopsocky films japanese movies and anime and of course the usual popculture references a staple to every tarantino filmthe movie starts off with a rather disturbing look at the main character known as the bride played by the fabulous uma thurman and the title character who we do not see but hear his voice on this volume bill later we figure out the story is all about a woman who wants nothing but revenge on the people responsible for beating the living crap out of her on her wedding day while she was pregnant killing everyone who was there that day putting a bullet in her head and leaving her comatose for four years the responsible ones besides bill are the members of the deadly viper assassination squad the squad members in order of appearance are vernita green played by the gorgeous vivica a fox oren ishii played by lucy liu elle driver played by daryll hannah and budd played by michael madsen the brides quest for revenge takes her all the way to the other side of the world in search of one of the members later on returning to america and continuing her vendetta against the remainder of the squad yes as youve all heard theres lots of blood and gore on this one especially the scenes in japan but the movie has many laughs some of them involving a scene of the bride in japan with a bartendersword maker played by the japanese movie legend sonny chiba theres also excellent music to top it off borrowed music of course but that makes the movie even more fun to watch as is usual in all of tarantinos movies theres also a very well made and bloody anime scene in which it describes one of the members originsi know there will be some people that will probably trash this movie for his excessive gore and violent content but as far as im concerned this is still a masterpiece maybe not another pulp fiction but worthy of being in your collection if youre a fan of tarantinos work,cruel
spoilers hereinthe title of the comment is from the ersatz master who makes a new sword for our avenger this denotes what is wrong about this film indeed why tarantino is to film as brittany spears is to musicmartial arts are about generational wisdom about the rigidity of the masters all the way back empowering new freedom all the way forward when a fight occurs it is not the weapons that are in combat not even the combatants it is the respective masters who operate through time and space ang lee understood this when he made his film one that could reliably called an homagethis is something else wholly americanized here we have a setup that is from cold war 60s culture a themed assassination squad the focus is on the individual when umas character fights it is in the eastwoodsegal tradition this is yankee individualism filtered through episodic teevee and only then cloaked in bmovie stylefor all this to work we have to have a god can be the noir god of detached fate can be the hitchcockdepalma god of the camera can be the lynch god of the filmmakers angst can be the leone god of irony or the fellini god of parallel dreams or medem of animated orgasm or bergman of the judge our man q wants them all and has to cut each of them to make room for the others he is not clean and focused like kurosawa but jumbled like rob zombieonce upon a time in mexico has identical aspirations but rodriguez steeps us in something he actually knows leverages an actor that actually understands irony not some second rater remember mrs peel and poison ivy clearly identifies his god observer depp and does it all himself writing directing shooting editing composing in comparison quentin is a novice and this is a dim conversation in a lonely corner of an effete hollywood partyas in all of life there are two kinds of people in film ill call them engineers and scientists engineers work with known vocabularies and principles they take insights of others and tinker about with different combinations to accomplish certain practical goals there is an imagination of sorts but it extends only so far as understanding the storehouse of components supplied by others the scientists go where no one else has ever gone into the void and bring back new reality that they convince us to accept which of these you choose for your life in film could determine everything about you because you live in your imagination compare ghost dog or even pillow book to both are about themselves cast in terms of what went before one is subtle even elusive in its truths possibly it is only one of many stories it is about as the little girl within it reads the other bill is already chewed for you brittany spears they even use the same musician as composer one is subtle and rich the other a jukeboxkurosawa is a scientist tarantino a shopkeeper and that brings me to my final point quentin does have terrific storytelling skills but look at how they are used all of his attention goes to explaining what happened before including the trademarkedtimefolds this is very well done and completely comprehendible but good storytelling the really good stuff is about what happens next see any of that herenope just sugared breakfast cerealteds evaluation  2 of 3 has some interesting elements,cruel
this is a simple tale and a favorite theme of filmmakers revenge there is even a vol 2 which came out six months later making the total time close to four hoursall of it revolves around a character who is left for dead and her husbandtobe killed at their wedding she goes after those responsible mainly bill played by david carradinepersonally i liked the second film much more because this one got carried away with the flying martial artstype violence oh yes being a tarantino film its going to be stylish mayhem but there is just too much of itas in crouching tiger hidden dragon and subsequent films of that nature there is a lot of swordplay and flying bodies floating in the air doing somersaults and other outrageous physicallyimpossible feats thats okay if one doesnt overdo it but sadly thats the case here as the bride uma thurman literally fights and defeats about 100 guys in one long scene the violence and lunacy of that scene got tiresome but i give tarantino credit for one thing he did that particular segment in blackandwhite which was very cool twistalso there was too much japanese spoken in this film with no subtitles leaving all englishspeaking viewers out in the cold as to what was being said at least have the courtesy to provide subtitles if you re going to have that much unexplained dialogstick to vol ii it summarizes this movie and gives you a much more intelligent and better story overall,cruel
this is the worst movie i have ever seen  i am a very generous movie critic but after witnessing this nightmare tonight i am forced to spill my rage when i heard all the critics rave about this movie i put aside my dislike for other tarantino films and decided i should see this particular film what a mistake  i realize this is only the first part of two films but i can honestly say there is no chance i will ever waste my time watching the second part  not only was the plot as unbelieveable as the weapons of mass destruction reasoning but the acting was subpar the cinematography was nauseating and i am disowning all of my friends who recommended this film the setting for this story is just as inconceivable as the smurfs  i have heard better ideas at gradeschool science fairs  maybe the sequel will be better but that doesnt seem all that difficult seeing as though i have seen more entertaining commercials for car dealershipsi cant understand the positive reaction to this film  the fight scenes were unfathomable jumping from crouching tiger to the adams family there is no logic to this film customers if you have a choice do not watch this movie  you will be disappointed,cruel
i was hoping for something better than pulp fiction but unfortunately the same things that i did not like about that movie were in this one glorifying violence for violences sake another movie from quentin tarantino that is just that another sad commentary on the moviemaking of our times it seems in order to make a great movie in some peoples eyes all you have to do is put as much violence sex and the f word as you can where do these people come from the photography was great but that will not get me to see this film again dont waste your money unless you enjoy severed limbs unrealistically squirting blood as though they were lawn sprinklers,cruel
roger ebert once wrote that quentin tarantino could make a bad film but could never make a boring film well vol 1 is a boring film above all its monotonous because most of the film is just a lengthy series of fights lacking any context that would allow us to side with one character over another worst of all the heroine is presented as some kind of unstoppable force whom no one stands a chance against especially males this premise reaches the height of absurdity when she takes on a few hundred fighters at the same time now im no big fan of the matrix or its sequels but the scene where neo battles a hoard of agent smiths at least makes sense within the rules the story has established there is nothing to explain why uma thurmans character is so powerful were just forced to accept that shes this invincible killing machine a premise that robs of the film of one of the crucial ingredients of suspense which is that the main character faces a challengeanother crucial ingredient thats conspicuously absent is emotional investment in the characters were supposed to sympathize with thurman because of how her cohorts betrayed her but what difference does it make when shes as much of a cold ruthless killer as they are okay so she doesnt hurt children big deal she is drawn way too thinly to give us any reason to root for heryou can love or hate pulp fiction but you cannot possibly accuse it of being predictable and the characters while amoral by our standards have definite human qualitiesone of the most telling scenes is when john travolta says hes going to go home and have a heart attack its the type of thing an ordinary person would say in that situation and it makes you forget that hes a hitman i cant figure out why anyone would think that brilliant film is in any way comparable to vol 1 which is sorely lacking in the witty dialogue that tarantino is famous for and which has none of the richness and complexity of pulp fiction that invites repeat viewings and helps you overlook the fact that you arent sure what the point of the story isi also think the violence in this film is excessive that may seem a strange thing for a tarantino fan to say but dont confuse violence with shock tarantino is a master at manipulating audience reaction even when he isnt showing things anywhere near as graphically as he could a classic example is the needletotheheart scene in pulp fiction we never see the actual impact but we do feel itthe stylized gore of is a lot less interesting in my view its one thing to show thurman chop a characters arm off its quite another to show a geyser of blood making it look like the characters body is literally being drainedthen a while later finding out that the character is not only still alive but fully conscious and lucid the rules of this films universe are so arbitrary theres no point in even talking about suspension of disbeliefthe sequel is a vastly superior film filling in the character motivations suspense and humor that the first film so desperately needed tarantino could have condensed the events of the first film into fifteen minutes and made the entire story into one long film which actually would not have been that long why did he make the first film as he did probably turning off many of his former fans at least he was trying something new rather than simply rehashing his old ideas but this time the experiment was a failure,cruel
quentin tarentinos volume 1 is the perfect film for todays trendy chic movie going audience casual in its violence flashy in its visuals and conspicuously lacking in content and theme the film is a genuine triumph of style over substance and a testament to the art of cool here is a film so selfconsciously arch and emotionally detached that it plays more like a live action cartoon than a drama set in anything remotely resembling the real world in fact one section of the movie literally is a cartoon the plot is essentially one long drawn out revenge scene with uma thurmon as a young woman systematically seeking out and killing a band of assassins who left her her unborn child and her entire bridal party for dead on the day of her wedding yet what person in his right mind goes to a tarentino film in search of a meaningful storyline indeed the thing that counts in a tarentino work is the directors obvious love for both movies and moviemaking a love which is visible in every frame he commits to film is tarentinos affectionate homage to the martial arts epics in which characters defy the laws of physics and gravity as they perform their deadly kabukitype ballet with knives and swords in this pastiche of ninja melodrama and japanese anime at least half the films running time is spent on elaborately staged swordfights and kickboxing sequences all of which are filmed with the utmost brio and verve the violence is indeed gory and graphic  with dismemberments galore and fountains of spurting blood  but so preposterously overblown that the violence eventually becomes abstract and thus doesnt offend us much while were watching it thurmon doesnt have much of a chance to develop a character here but the steeleyed intensity combined with the strange sense of vulnerability that she brings to the role makes her fascination to watch nonethelessyet for all its cinematic joie de vivre and visual inventiveness theres something a bit unsatisfying about volume 1 after all is said and done perhaps its the fact that the film feels so much like a clinical exercise in style that it lacks the power to really draw us into its world we watch it with an air more of detached bemusement than of emotional involvement perhaps too the absence of anything much going on beneath the surface leaves us with little of substance to take home with us once weve left the theater i suspect that this is the very effect tarentino is going for here  that if we were made to care deeply about anything that was happening on the screen we would somehow be violating his code of coolness that we would be simply reacting to movies with the kind of programmed emotional responses the director is clearly militating against the problem is that while we can appreciate all that on an intellectual level we are still left feeling relatively empty and unfulfilled by movies end perhaps the completion of the story in volume 2 will help to rectify that condition,cruel
the fourth movie of quentin tarantino has an excellent story and elements very attractivethe beginning has strong scene because bill shoots to the bride while she tells his about her baby the sentence the revenge is a dish best served cold tells us the subject of revenge along of movie the revenge is an important subject because it is an inseparable element of the humankind from the beginnings of human history the revenge has been present in many storiesthe soundtrack is good because the director uses the appropriate music in the adequate moment during all movie especially in the chapter five when we can hear funny and action music in my opinion the most characteristic music is the whistling and the songs of group 5678sthe japanese culture is present in all movie its language its ideology the samurai swords katanas and the anime animation really tarantino make one tribute to the japanese movies with his filmdespite her rancor and her angry the bride always faces her enemies without traps and stratagems that is to say she fights with honor and bravery in all momentthe main antagonist in this part is oren ishii because we see her life from the parents death until her own death so we can understand the personality of orenlike in others tarantinos movies there is huge use of blood in fight scenes especially during the sword fights in my opinion this is an element strong and attractivethe movie can divide in the five parts  the chapter one 2 the bride fights against vernita green  the chapter two the bloodsplattered bride the bride stays in coma for four years when she wakes up she begins her revenge  the chapter three the origin of oren the most novel part of this film the bride tells us the most important events in the life of oren ishii in anime animation  the chapter four the man from okinawa the bride goes to okinawa for visit hattori hanzo and he gives one samurai sword  the chapter five showdown at the house of blue leaves the best part of film the bride fights against the bodyguards the crazy 88s and oren ishii using her swordundoubtedly vol 1 is one best movies of all time for many reasons and is a film that all people should watch,cruel
is about a woman seeking revenge against a group of assassins who violently murder everyone at her wedding which she herself only just manages to survive thats it beyond that simple sentence lie no finer nuances or greater subplots in this contextually simplistic yarn we know next to nothing about the bride with her real name beeped out for no apparent reason because that would be just too much information her own history why her wedding party was targeted or who the mysterious bill is now admittedly this is the opening of a two parter film but even so to completely strip away the context in which the bride carries out her actions leaves the film and its central character cold and devoid of any real emotional attachment its a bit like finishing the fellowship of the ring with no idea why frodo and sam are heading for mt doom how they began their journey or who they even are  only that theyve got a list of enemies they have to dispatch along the wayat around an hour and 45 minutes theres certainly no shortage of time in which this could have been achieved or even the whole affair concluded in full instead tarantino opts for long and drawnout fighting scenes in which arms legs and all manner of body parts are chopped off in quick succession whilst these scenes are staged with precision and considerable skill there is no sense of urgency or any question as to what the final outcome will be we know the bride will walk away victorious her revenge partially accomplished but that isnt enough to carry a film aloneand so we descend into a tarantinoesque swamp of film references and homages weaving a world which is completely unbelievable but so selfserious it prevents you from enjoying it as a lighthearted adventure after the film moves over to japan we enter a realm in which an army of crime minions lack guns and are defeated by a single individual people carry swords openly on planes and teenagers act as highly trained bodyguards to senior crime bosses whilst theres nothing wrong with creating this kind of fictitious universe it is highly jarring after the environmental realism which characterises the american portion of the movie and leaves you feeling like tarantino is simply treating japan as a semimythical fantasy land where he can indulge his love of mindless violencebut when all the fighting is over and the film draws to a close with a halfhearted attempt at a cliffhanger i felt as if i had travelled nowhere felt nothing and ultimately seen nothing the few precious moments in which blood isnt gushing out are spent in pointless and prolonged conversations about nothing an interlude before the film can get back to more scenes of raw violence i know this film is based around the theme of revenge an irrational feeling if there ever was one but that should be no excuse to create cardboard cutout characters acting out a movie with no greater plot other than to kill each and every person who stands in your way,cruel
if there was one thing we knew about qt prior to it was that he was a perfectionist if there was another it was that he was a master of dialogue and characterdriven filmmaking where his visual flourishes were expertly but subtly woven into the background of his films thus when he decided to make his next feature a fullblown action film qt was not only entering new territory but was determined to show us that his mastery of the visual side to filmmaking was just as sharp as his mastery of the verbal sideone might have argued that he was already accomplished in this respect after all there were moments of technical mastery such as the tracking shots in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction he gave us an extraordinary example of how splitscreen technology can be used to move a story forward in jackie brown his use of the camera in frenetic scenes such as the mr pink getaway scene was as raw and effective as the best action directors and his limited interference with the camera in the majority of his dialoguedriven scenes were indicative of a very disciplined mind reminiscent of the greats such as hitchcock kurosawa allen and of course kubrick however qt believed and with some justification that action films are from a technical point of view the most difficult films to make well and if he was to prove his worth as a director he would have to make it is an action directorto say that qt was successful in his desire to cut it as an action director is an understatement of gargantuan proportions as is an action film that goes beyond any that came before it or have emerged since not content to toil in one of the many action subgenres qt bridges at least 4 genres from spaghetti western to japanese anime seamlessly interweaving the different styles and pushing the boundaries of their conventions to the point that the viewer finds hisherself witnessing a broader yet unique and singular genre of qts own creation with each passing scene qt squeezes twists and stretches traditional conventions to find new ways to lure the viewer into his frenetic world of pure vengeanceand this is precisely what makes kb such an extraordinary filmgoing experience it is the profoundly imaginative manner in which he conceives of and executes the action scenes that is the most jawdropping aspect to this film this film is built on a seemingly endless series of conceptual flourishes that usurp and assimilate traditional samurai kungfu anime and western genre conventions onto his unique and broader platform take for example the moment when the bride plucks the eye out of one her assailants signaling the films switch from colour to black and white the act which becomes more significant to the story in vol 2 is a conceptual bridge to the traditional samurai swordplay film convention of filming bloody scenes in black and white so as to avoid censorship it is with this convention that qt heralds the imminence of bloodshed and if the eyeplucking is anything to go by a lot of itof course one mustnt limit ones review of kb to its technical innovation it is after all a qt film and like all his films its fueled by his typical razorsharp dialogue and dazzlingly original characters this is of course yet another factor that raises it above your typical actioneer in that the time is taken to give each of the main characters a backstory and mutually contradicting layers naturally qts peerless casting plays a part here as he chooses actor after actors who inhabit these layered characters in ways that retrospectively speaking it would seem only they couldthe gang of assassins on whom the bride is wreaking her revenge are played by an unlikely ensemble of actors who each exude a unique brand of cool which is expertly tailored for a film of this nature populating the background of this story are an array of characters which together with the actors who play them eg gordon lui michael parks  sonny chiba david carradine represent a knowing and sometimes audacious nod to the genres that kb is exploringcentral to the films casting of course is uma thurman as both volumes of the film rest on her shoulders most important here i believe is that thurman never once stops being a woman i have found that one of the most consistently irritating features of heroinecentred films is the tendency for the woman to act like a typical male specifically macho hero nowhere in the course of this film is there a trace of this in her performance instead we are given a rather interesting portrayal of a woman clinging to her revenge mission as though there was nothing else to live for throughout the film she demonstrates an authentic anger composure emotion and cunning that is distinctly femininehowever the real star of this film is qt ultimately kb is a reflection of an intuition for filmmaking that goes beyond special as the film progressed i found myself repeatedly reevaluating a director who i had already considered one of the greats and each time elevating his position in that hierarchy i almost regretted that kb was nothing more than an action film as films of that genre are often looked down on in acts of ignorant filmsnobbery however like qt argues great action films are not easy to make they involve the choreography of words sound and physical movement into a unified whole kb is a testament to this ideal and as a result it is a memorising piece of filmmaking that in terms of technical and conceptual innovation is matched only by 2001 a space odyssey and citizen kane seriously,cruel
the trademarks of quentin tarantinos movies are well known smart dialogue selfawareness of popular culture from the banal to the arcane cinematographic innovation ultraviolence and a pervading air of cool after the runaway success of his first two movies his third film jackie brown traded some excess of these qualities for a bit of conventional characterisation i liked the result although hardcore fans were disappointed but for his fourth film tarantino has moved in the opposite direction a homage to asian martialarts films sees tarantino at his most stylised and is as stupid as its name the wafer thinplot sees a female assassin out to kill those who wronged her and little happens except for an improbable sequence of slayings the sad thing is that there are many little touches that delight in this movie tarantino has not lost his mastery of the art of filmmaking at least not in the detail but devoid of any rational context it adds up only to showing off with blood while uma thurman in the lead role is wooden failing to convey either human emotion or cartoon menace whats really unforgivable however is that instead of dazzling us with a quick punch tarantino made a film so long that in spite of its essential vacuity it had to be split into two movies to make it a commercial proposition and im really not sure ill be bothering with volume two,cruel
not sure if there are actual spoilers but checked it to be on the safe sidewhile this was nowhere near the worst movie i have ever seen those would be the blair witch project and hannibal it is nowhere near the top either the entire screen play must have been written in about 15 minutes the plot was silly the dialog was bad very bad and it was slow so slow that i wanted the scenes to be done so they could move alongbut it was visually pleasing if confusing the switches from color to black and white seemed to be totally random and the anime bit was distractingits certainly not what i expected though it was oddly compelling,cruel
no i wasnt expecting another pulp fiction or even another reservoir dogs or jackie brown but as being written and directed by quentin tarantino starring uma thurman i thought this was rather a cool moviewell this is not true at allvol 1 is just 111 minutes of gratuitous violence theres no story no good directing no acting no funof course if you like to see absurd fights and lots of people being killed youll find this a wonderful movie for me its just the proof that quentin tarantino fell downmy vote 3 out of 10,cruel
dont get me wrong i love pulp fiction but this one i even couldnt make myself to watch to the end im sure this movie will make headlines but i will not recommend it to my friends to watch i didnt hear any new good original music selection in the movie either sorry but i dont understand how come this movie is rated so high example o brother where art thou rating is lower maybe imdb need to do something about how rating is calculated or maybe it is just tasteless me,cruel
was my favorite movie ever  every article poster or clipping i could find i hung in my room  this was of course before i saw the film then came october 10 2003 a full moon  i was bursting with excitement then a bloody 2 hours later i was bursting in tears sad tearssure there are those who loved whyoh because its funny  riiiight funny in a bloodyslapstick humor tarantino is capable of the best humor ever but why didnt quentin take the humor the story the acting the movie hell himself seriously  where is the trademark speeches and conversations huhoh because its a tribute to the grind house films its a reference to old hong kong action films  great so why is it described as the 4th film by quentin tarantino  sure he wrote it he directed it im pretty sure in vol 2 which is supposed to be good hell even be in it  but cmon people this is by no means a film by quentin tarantino,cruel
artistic  gimme a break  what a load of crap  whats artistic about copying martial arts movies and adding vivid color an attractive lead blond babe and drum upon drum of tomato juicepulp fiction and reservoir dogs were both great movies  they were still too violent in my opinion but the movies were still outstanding  this movie is utter crap  there is no story there is no point besides vengeance and it is mired in meaningless violence dismemberment bloodshed and deathif it werent for how attractive all the women were in this movie and the good cinematography i would have left  i almost did and i never leave movies  im always hoping that there will have been some compelling reason to have stayed by the time i get to the end  when i reached the end of i was just so relieved it was done with and i could leave  i cant think of anything compelling enough to recommend this movie to anyonecrap,cruel
possible spoilersdepending on whom you talk to quentin tarantino is either a great director paying homage to as many films and film genres he can dream up in his overextended forehead or he is an unoriginal ripoff artist whos only claim to cinematic achievement is that he puts enough violent episodes in his films to please his bloodthirsty hard core fans and keep them forever loyal  with he takes things a step further by paying homage not only to grindhouse kungfu and samurai films but also pt barnum  in other words quent knows theres a sucker born every minute and most of them are his loyal fansi have seen four very bad films this year it runs in the family bad boys ii basic and now  in we find out that quent is so in love with his own directing style that he ended up totally disregarding the kind of film he was supposed to be making and instead uses his idea to try and prove how artsy and cool he still is to his adoring fans  what is saddest of all about the whole thing is he had a good idea here but flubs it so badly trying to be supercool that it ends up as one overextended mass of carnage and bloodletting that seems to go on for eternitytarantino claims this is his fourth film  he proudly proclaims it in the opening titles  what he does not proclaim proudly is that this is only the first half of his film as the words volume i are once again almost hidden in the opening title it appears very small as vol 1 just as it was done on the web site for the film in it the subsequent tv ads and theatrical trailers  so in actuality this is tarantinos third and a half film but you wont see that title card  i guess hes not as proud splitting the film as one would think and after viewing it thats quite understandable but more about that latertarantino again refuses to be bounded by any type of linear story telling normally that would not be a problem with me but if any film cried out for straightforward story telling this one did  after the opening scene of bill putting the bride into a coma for four years and after the credits roll we immediately go to his first chapter which is a confrontation between the bride and copperhead  vivica a fox after dispensing with fox in front of foxs daughter uma departs in her vehicle and as she crosses off the copperheads name we see she has already crossed off the name of oren ishii lucy liu  so at the beginning of the film we already know she has done away with one of her adversaries so when that battle does appear late in the first half of this film any tension that might have been gained is completely destroyed in the first 16 minutes of the first half of so much for nonlinear story telling  though he likes to spill blood tarantino obviously hates any kind of suspense which might explain his recent putdown of hitchcock  it gets worsefrom there we flashback to the church where bill shot the bride and where his assasins created havoc on her wedding party  after being found still alive by a sheriff and his deputies we then get the bride in the hospital lying in a coma  at this time we also get elle driver alias california mountain snake alias daryl hannah in a split screen dressing as a nurse filling a syringe with poison supposedly to finish the bride off  it is a mission we know beforehand wont succeed so when her cell phone rings and its bill telling her to call it off the whole scene becomes incredibly pointless  it is here because tarantino wants again to show us his coolness storytelling be damnedsoon we get more pointless tarantino cool  after a silly bit in the hospital where the bride wakes up from her coma and looking to be in as good of a condition as ali macgraw did on her deathbed in love story so much so that she is able to immediately dispense with two silly perverts soon she begins talking to her toes to get them to move  here we get what is suppose to be a cool anime sequence telling us the background of oren ishii who is already dead because we saw the name crossed out on the brides notebook even if we havent seen it on the screen yet  since we know she is dead and we are probably going to see how she was killed soon the whole animated sequence and not a very good one becomes another pointless exercise in tarantinos look at me im cool disease  its no wonder this film ran three hours  the rest of the first half of his film goes on and on in much the same vain  interminably so  even when we near the four month intermission point we get the bride just beginning to list her targets on her notepad so in essence when we reach the end we are back near the beginning again  more coolthen there is the big fight scene where before confronting 0ren who we know is already dead the bride must dispense with about a hundred of her comrades including a teenage girl in a catholic type school uniform  what we get is a lot of severed limbs where everyone must have five times as much blood as the human body normally carries so tarantino can spray it around the room like a gardener watering the lawn  a good portion of this fight is in black and white i suppose to spare us the horror of it all  it doesnt matter black and white or living color the whole bit is cartoonish and more comical than intense the fact that tarantino proclaimed it would be too intense and we would be unable to watch his full film in one sitting because of it is as ludicrous as the scene itself  it must be the pt barnum in him working  if there had been some interesting swordplay it might have been redeemable but because it is more important to tarantino to have his blood joke you actually see very little of the fighting mostly due to some of the worse editing ever seen in this type of film  as if black and white werent enough shortly after we get the finish of the battle completely in shadows with the lights turned off  more tarantino cool more pointlessnesswhen the brides fight with the already dead lucy liu does occur our only curiosity is how she dispenses with her  the scene is beautifully photographed but the battle itself is so quick and anticlimactic we can only stare at the screen and go huh  some decent one on one swordplay would have been nice here but i guess that doesnt fit in with tarantinos scheme of putting as much blood out there as possible  so much for paying actual homage to samurai filmstarantino could have done what he supposedly set out to do  between this half of the film and the second half well get in february there may have been enough to make an hour and a half or two hour film homage to the genre he claims to love  unfortunately his love of himself is becoming so overwhelming his love of showing off his filmmaking coolness interferes too much with what this film could have been and should have been  will his faithful followers ever be convinced that this is an overextended two part self congratulatory two part rip off probably not but tarantino knows that  so did pt

this movie was intense creative unique not to mention brilliant and all around simply hardcore never in my life have i found myself so excited about a movie after leaving the theater never in my life have i found myself telling everyone i came in contact with to see this film and never in my life have i found myself anticipating any sequel this badlyi dont want to ruin or spoil it for anyone but its true you have to have a strong stomach to handle it its definitely not a film for everyone but if you can stomach ityou will be amazed by it i give mad props to quentin tarantino this film is like nothing ive ever seen before that man is nothing short of genius,cruel
tarantino will give us a chapter2 i also wanna do that but just to add some comment about what other people wrote about this movie 1scirceo from san antonio wrotei saw this movie on friday saturday and may go again today 10 out of 10 i cant believe it people come back watching a movie several time when the plot is complicate this is enough easy also for dumb or  impaired people but here we get a very simple plot with almost no dialog 2ronin 47 from sacramento wrote in a nutshell the best movie ive seen in 5 years   this is the funniest bul i have heard in 5 years i wanna just list some movie from the last 5 years american history x 1998   saving private ryan 1998  truman show the 1998 american beauty 1999 fight club 1999 matrix the 1999 sleepy hollow 1999 gladiator 2000 mission impossible ii 2000 pitch black 2000 fast and the furious the 2001monsters inc 2001 shrek 2001 spy kids 2001 swordfish 2001 and may others even the deludental lara croft or charlies angels are any way much better than zeeman from saint john wrotetarantino is a genius another masterpiece how this user can say that the plot is as simple as a 3rd world movie and the duels seem slow and banal after what we saw in the matrix or crouching tiger i guess that all those people have been to the movie theatre very rarely in the last 5 years this movie is just an empty stupid movie based on some blood splashing and some visual effects which make blade a visual masterpiece in the confrontation apologising for my bad english i suggest  dont let the advertising push you to waste your time and money,cruel
the day i saw vol 1 was the first time ive ever seriously contemplated staying at the theater and seeing it again right afterwards thats because it is literally so stuffed with cool stuff that it was hard to mentally process it all i remember that at one point near the end i was literally trembling with anticipation of what was about to happenquentin tarantino writer and director of 3 great movies pulp fiction jackie brown and reservoir dogs returns after a 6 year absence and if you need any proof that hes still got the magic touch this is itunlike his other films which were all witty toughtalking crime dramas is a martial arts movie the ultimate martial arts movieuma thurman plays the bride her real name is kept a mystery and is humorously bleeped whenever anyone says it a former assassin who is beaten and shot and left for dead on her wedding day by her old crew she wakes up out of a coma 4 years later escapes from the hospital and sets out on a mission of revenge against them and especially against their leader and her former lover bill david carradine that story is pretty old but a good martial arts movie doesnt need any more i simply cant describe how good this movie is i havent been this involved in a movie from scenetoscene momenttomoment since well pulp fiction the two films are very different but both have the same shifting timeline structure badass attitude and utterly brilliant soundtrackspeaking of that soundtrack i dont think ive ever seen a movie with so many moments that are a perfect match between picture and soundthe performances are across the board perfect everyone including vivica a fox lucy liu and daryl hannah as her enemies is completely convincing but obviously this is umas show her character is one of the best in the history of kickass vengeanceseeking good guys every smile cold stare punch kick and tear running down her face you feel all the way down to your soul yes sir qts still got the touch not only is it the best of the year its the most invigorating soulstirring heartbreaking exciting aweinspiring fun time ive had in a theater in many a moon as most people know was originally intended to be one movie but was nearly four hours long and was cut into two volumes this was the right decision because 4 hours of this and my head might have exploded plus believe me when i say that where it ends truly leaves you chomping at the bit for vol 2,cruel
it is just plain sad to think that anyone would enjoy this movie  somebody must have seen one too many bruce lee films  this is more a bad jokecartoon than anything else and worse a 100 bore  geez  what a waste of talent  speaking of bruce lee  if you like bruce lee you wont like this film so save yourself some money and rent some bruce lee films martial art is an art and there is little respect here for art  this is not good hollywood stuff and will not hold up as the years go by  what a waste of talent all the way around  if you value your time and karma dont waste your time with this one  or part two  i aint gonna watch part two to find out i only bet on sure things,cruel
spoilers throughoutso what do i say in my review how wonderful how great this movie is well many know that it is after all in the top 100 films of all time i have a hard time doing reviews on movies like this that are almost to perfect whatever can one say tarentinos both volumes are fully deserving of being called instant classics there are few movies that mesmerize this much and really mesmerize is the perfect word to describe the effect of the movies they are simply extraordinary but there was one thing i didnt like in volume one that was not so prevelent in twothats the violence i enjoyed both movies but i did give volume two a ten and this a nine the reason is the violence it was a bit much in the first volume many people i know still have yet to see either of the movies because of this reason and i myself was a bit wary at first one is a lot worse in this regard then two and even though i think the movie is fantastic in its photography writing performances etc the brutality was tough to take i really can see how someone could not like thisi actually prefer two a bit because of the highly charged dialog driven atmosphere i will concede however that it really doesnt matter which version one personally preferstheir both stunningly great moviesthe gore in volume one is many times almost cartoonish but there are still parts where one wants to say enough already it is just to muchok its tarentino but stillof coarse many would argue that was necessary for the overall story that is my one major gripe about volume one otherwise id say it was perfect when i say i liked two better it wins by a smidgen anyway and for mainly that reason and another reason is because everything comes together in the second one i am actually glad they were released as two separate picturesmy favorite characterother then the bride i just dont know i liked all of them owren ishi was an intense person to watch mountain snake was so evil kudos to hanna whod have ever thought wed see the innocent little mermaid in a role like this and there was something about that twisted little assistant gogo that was heres that word again mesmerizing she kind of stole the show in some waysmy favorite scene may have been the fight between liu and thurman although that scene was mighty intense it was spellbinding the way it was carried out all that intensity against the cool lovely wintry settingto me the movies are almost to good in that one really does not want them to end i really would as would some of my friends like to see a prequelwith the same cast please id like to know see how they all met their various relationships with each other what made them assassins we do not know except for lui id like to see the love story between bill and the bride id like to see friendships being built each persons story id like to see it all the story of is to good to leave alone although follow ups are almost always bad this is tarenteno hey you never know,cruel
this is bad film making that becomes worse with every minute quentin has run out of ideas and takes a saying that its easy to get an emotional reaction from audience quite literallyinstead of trying to criticize the film ill just list some of the scenes and themes that are graphically presented in paedofillia ripping ones eyes out raping a comatose woman biting someones tongue off cutting of off arms and heads with huge sprays of blood cutting head in half with a good shot of the persons brains a bullet rips through some guys brains and camera follows through the wound with two girls on the other side of the wound looking through shooting a pregnant woman in the head killing a woman in front of her daughter and then giving that girl a little speech about revenge a 17 yr old asks a guy if he wants to have sex with her and as soon as he says yes she butchers himdoes all this even need criticism,cruel
i have seen some bad movies before and this is certainly one of the worst i truly dont understand the ratings it has gotten from the critics not to mention other viewers  i would like my money back for this one  reminds me of the really bad cheesey horror films of many years ago,cruel
beeing a devoted tarantino fan since reservoir dogs i had very high expectations on his new movie as many people but folks lets be honest didnt meet our expectations did it very plain full of cliches yeah the jakuzaboss is pedophile snore and completely senseless splatter and gore am i the only one who does not see any amusement in watching 88 people getting hacked up that is not funny whats the point of this scene guess it had to be done to camouflage the absence of beeing able to write a good script in the end but without the usual great dialogs full of irony and witz instead qt is torturing the audience with japanese monologs full of dullness and a not at all convincing uma thurman with the most horrible plain jane haircut one has ever seen i guess was meant as a tribute to old fashioned hongkong movies but despite the gallons of ridiculous spilled blood it arrived as a farce without charme,cruel
i had hoped to see something in this film that would convince me that tarantino had grown as a filmmaker but i didnt  i fell for the hype and i wound up being very disappointedall style and no substance really doesnt begin to describe the film  it is really more a commercial  a commercial selling selfindulgence and shallowness  a good metaphor would be a raucous night of drinking its fun and wonderful at the time but in the light of morning one is just left with regrets,cruel
the first review written for was right on after that what are you people thinking  first off ridiculousness aside this movie was a waste of good money and celluloid that could be used for good cinema bmovies should know their place and no amount of good actors or lame choreography is going to make it any better  this movie has opened my eyes to the juvenile mind set that quentin tarantino possesses  an antisocial 4th grader who likes to draw stick figures of people getting their heads chopped off because its funny would have made this movie  to be frank i was one of those 4th graders like any normal adolescent fascinated with the concept of violence  but you know what  i grew up and apparently quentin tarantino never did  when will hollywood especially miramax and harvey weinstein learn that epic does not necesarrily equal horrifically violent,cruel
the man should have given up after reservoir dogs which was by far his best film to date  in you are in for a lot of ridiculous blood splatters to pay homage to the old kung fu movies of the 70s but the story has been done over and over again  when will anyone create a compelling story line  i think they did this movies years ago and most recently in the most recent grand theft auto games  you are left for dead but survived now youre out for revenge on the people that you used to work forwithwhen will the world wake up and quit paying to see garbage like this and demand that hollywood takes the time to create a descent story linethe action in the movie was above par  i will give kudos to the choreographer for the fight scenes but they are few and far between  the best part of this movie had to be the animation sequence  but just like other movies prime example being star wars episode 2 with the yoda fight scene that everyone raved about five minutes of extraordinary movie doesnt save a two hour long movie  i still only give this movie one star  not going to spend money on part two  much rather throw my money into the street than support his movies  by the way to all those that worship quinton as a pop culture god  get a life,cruel
whether you take this movie as an allegory or just as pure on entertainment it is sadly lacking the fountaining of blood is remincent of the 80s and quickly tiring the cross between those unbelievable badly dubbed marial art movies with 1 weakened man in this case woman able to defeat armies despite the draining injuries and anime would be laughable if it wasnt the whole moviepossible spoiler alert below plus you can feel no connection with the leading lady who is for some mysterious reason a target of a group she once embraced it is hard to feel bad for an killer when the table was finally turned on her no only does her previous lifestyle fail to enamour us to her the fact she is walking down the aisle while pregnant with another mans child does not particularly endear me to herthere are so many unanswered holes in the plotwhy was she targeted where does she get the money to fly all over the place from how could she lift a man above her head when she was too weak to barely lift her sword how can she recover for years of atrophied limbs in a mere 13 hours  how can she casually be near the scene of so many crimes and not get caught  and please make up your mind is she an expert with the weapons or not  it seems every new foe she meets she is almost defeated but perseveres and triumphs,cruel
the movie had no real plot it had nothing to do with anime and the battle scenes were poorly done i hate to see one of my favourite directors flop so badly i am amazed to see how many people think is a good movie what is there to watch sure there is uma jumping around with a sword but there are a lot of movies that have done it way better than i almost fell a sleep watching this movie people tell me that i didnt get it but i bet there is no hidden plot that could suddenly make look like a whole movie i have heard that some people did not like it because of all the violence my opinion is there wasnt any and if there was it was made with no taste was just like the blair witch project a huge disappointment,cruel
it takes 6 years to come up with this a plotless piece of crap with nonexistent characters dialogue which is embarrassingly bad why do people still think that qt is a great writer because he uses the fword as often as possible in his dialogue no drive no tension only two fight scenes none of which is anything special  the first uma thurmanvivica fox is a weak rethread of countless superior indoor catfights from hong kong bmovies circa 1990 pick up almost any moon leeyukari oshima film and youll know what im talking about the second is a long slashfest featuring a lot of blackandwhite gore why its not like the source movies were in blackandwhite but which once again has no buildup no excitement outside of shock value see uma rip an eyeball out the wirework is extremely shoddy unless thats another deliberate homage of course no one impresses with any move not even liu chia hui uma is clearly doubled a lot and there is simply not a single wowmoment martial artswise fans of dismemberment will enjoy the scene though why yuen woping was needed here beats me  any american choreographer who had watched enough early seventies samurai and kung fu films could have put these fights together and how anyone can talk about an adrenalinedrenched ride when you get only two action setpieces beats me  especially since the rest of the film has nothing to offer except look at how clever i amhomage ripoffs and admittedly a fun soundtrack when i read the ecstatic reviews this films has gotten i get the impression people are talking about the film they wanted to have seen rather than the film they saw moreover the action quotient in part 2 will be even less than in part 1  so heres a new theory on why the film was cut into two halves its just too damn boring to watch in one go,cruel
ok we all should know by now that quentin tarantino has a special affinity for blowing peoples minds in vol 1 he goes all out and continued it in vol 2 featuring uma thurman as a woman out to get the people who tried to kill her this is definitely not a movie for the squeamish especially with that scene in the restaurantwhy make such a movie dont ask stupid questions the point here is to have everything come together to form one giant mass of asskicking and youd better believe that everyone does just that in a perfect homage to almost every martial arts movie in history this is what movies with giant casts should be fantastic,cruel
i have to admit that i am late at being a fan of quentin tarantinos pulp fiction movies because i havent come around to watch any of them i regret not having to view them any time earlier his three previous movies reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown were the movies that have made me decide to watch this because all three of them were clever witty and entertaining but most of all they were all great movies i also must add true romance as it is one of my favorite movies of all time though it wasnt directed by tarantino anyway though i do enjoy a martial arts movie here and there this wasnt that entertaining what happened to all of those shrewd lines he put into his other movies that make you laugh thinking that was witty the whole point of this movie is revenge that takes a long time to accomplish and its not worth my time all i can say is this is the worst movie ive seen that was directed by tarantino i havent seen vol 2 yet and i will probably get around it eventually i hear the story is much more emotional in that case when it comes to vol 1 id rather read a book  110,cruel
i dont get why this movie should receive a mature rating this movie is a joke blood doesnt flow out of a person like a fountain the violence was unrealistic and unnecessary fight scenes were unbearably idiotic with hundreds of useless minions having a go at uma and barely managing to maim her i had to endure through all the bull and in the end it was like i spent my time watching someone play a video game at some video game convention on a biga55 screen the only good thing though was the acting of the characters they really got their grove on and made me believe i was watching a video game in conclusion this is a lame movie if you like violence dont watch this because it just trivializes violence and if you dont like violence then dont watch the movie because the whole movie is basically a fountain of wateryvery fake blood from start till the end with some scenes with actual storyline thrown in just for the kick of it,cruel
by anyones standards this film lacks a good plot and descent characters for it be considered a classic is laughable to be found the 81st greatest film of all time is even more ridiculous in time this will be found out a consolation to those who voted for it on hype rather than actually watching it and realising its sit it that the sequel is a lot worse tarantino made one great one good and one alright film in the early 90s this not confirm him by any means as great filmmaker and this confounds it in short will one day become similar to the films it is using as its muse awful story plot and actors with a huge amount of violence,cruel
the graphics on this was very bad i thought the director would do better i would rather stick my nob in a nintendo then watch this way to fake turd very awful the gore was rubbish it should have had computer generation i would of said it would have been good if it was made by a low budget company but no he had to of made it too fake the script was too over exaggerated i know the director thought he tried to make fun of japanese films but he made it too obvious to the point it wasnt funny i can only say as much as 10 lines because the movie was simple so i gave back a simple remark there capeche combrende amigos now im just said my peace and i will leave now,cruel
this movie was useless and pointlessif it wasnt made by quentin tarantino it wouldnt be getting all the fame its getting this movie was carried by tarantino groupiesfan boysstalkers this movie has the intellect of the movie jackassnothing but stupidity violence anime kungfu how is this a great moviejust like any tarantino movie it doesnt make sense because hes trying this artsy approach which doesnt work too well when i watch a movie i want to be entertained enlightened or even made think any of his movies make me say whati pity anyone that enjoyed this movie,cruel
this movie was awful i might be able to see how some people may like there are always those people out the but this movie should be on the list for 100 worst films every it took me 5 times renting to finally watch the whole movie no stop i fell asleep the times before it wasnt what i call good if you want to watch good movies dont watch this this is one movie i can say i only watched the whole thing because of uma i couldnt avoid missing a film she was in but man i wish i would have spent the money some where else this time i could have got more entertainment from some toys kids play with than this movie gave me but like said we all have are opinions i you want to waste your money you earned it so go ahead maybe just maybe you might like it,cruel
i was looking forward to seeing this film after many excellent write ups on imdb however right from the start of the film i knew it was going to be poor the scene in the hospital was awful and in my opinion was like something out of a b movie the cartoon sketches were so bad i was tempted to turn it of there and then but i never gave up thinking things can only get better but they dont how can a film get 83 on imdb when it is nothing short of crap i have enjoyed some of q t s other films but this is utter rubbish in my opinion dead mans shoes blow this film out of the water when it comes to the story acting a very believable script,cruel
i saw this movie once borrowed from a friend and thought it was good and yes i had heard all the quentin tarantino hype i felt that i wast content by only watching it once so i watched it again now i began to think it was an incredible movie soon i bought the qt collection and now i have seen the movie two more times and i will soon watch it again then you might wonder whats so special about it perhaps even after youve seen it well for me its the special feeling of hongkong nostalgia mixed with perhaps the best soundtrack ive ever heard the ending sequence with the pan flute music beats everything made up to date hell i even bought the soundtracks of both movies and i have never bought a soundtrack before be careful though if you dont like blood very much because there is a lot yes i think that just because its a hyped tarantino movie it makes it even better i admit that it gives it like an aura making it even better anyway i sum up the movie as being a philosophical gory journey through music perfection and a hail to all movie making 10 jondan,cruel
i saw volume one recently and was amazed at the skill of not only the actors uma and lucys sword fight rocks but of the supporting cast there were moments where my stomach turned but i like that sort of reaction in some films i did find the anime portion of the film telling the story of oshis parents murders slightly unnerving but my interpretation of that because perhaps having real child of that age put in that position would really freak that child outbut thats just me i really liked the fight the bride had with oshi the director must have really enjoyed making this film and i hope more come soon,cruel
ever since i saw reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown all my in my all time top ten favourites all ive ever waited for is the next film from tarantino and here it is vol1 is probably after takeshi kitanos zatoichithe best violent swordplay film ever made the choreography of this film done by the magic yeun wooping i believe he did the matrix movies and jet li movies is some of the best ever done in an action film the story you can tell has tarantinos signature all over it from the characters to the dialogue to the hot soundtrack i have to say my favourite thing about though is definitely the characters right from the bride to the man from okinawa it was also good to see darryl hannah in a bad role for once as the crazy elle driver my favourite scene is in fact not the end showdown but the beginning fight the bride has with jeannie bell aka copperhead which is brilliant and hilarious especially when she tries to shoot her through the cereal box and the bride gives her one right in the chest in front of her daughter maybe a lot would agree its not as good as dogs or pulp fiction but i loved it right from the start to the end of vol2,cruel
i rated this a 3 only because its better than crouching tiger hidden dragon which earned a 1 as with cthd i never saw this in a theater and resisted the temptation to get the dvd i finally did see it on cable when there was nothing else on worth watching unlike cthd the trailer didnt immediately turn me off unlike with cthd tarantino was wise enough in his trailer not to show the sequences which defied all logic physics anatomy and medical science  and of course he couldnt show the gorethis film plays not only to a contemporary audiences ignorance but also its desensitization to graphic violence its a gore fest from beginning to the end it counts on the fact that a highlystylized adrenalin rush can overcome any residual horror at the carnage depicted the audience is further conditioned to accept gruesome deaths as something cool to watch anyone who watches this film and feels excited rather than disturbed could benefit from a but more introspectiontarantino is also obviously a more talented director than the makers of cthd the best part of the film is an anime flashback sequence that makes sense since the whole film is live action anime but then the same criticisms can be leveled against anime as this filmthat films like this can be as successful as they have speaks volumes about our society,cruel
ok i have seen some good reviews about this film but i just dont get it  its the most overhyped film ever its a totally rip off of old martial art films i love drunken master snake in eagles shadow etc but this is crap i know its meant to be a kind of tribute to them old films but it just isnt any good ive seen all this before but that was when i was 10 years old not 21 just because its a female playing the lead character doesnt make it original the more i think about this movie the more i dislike itno plot spoilers here just an honest opinion for those who dont watch anything apart from mainstream films i could see how this could seem exciting and new but for those who have seen more you will know this is pants shame because i like qt films generally,cruel
loves these movies cant wait for the next installment hopefully if there is one first im a girl so im all for seeing a bad ass female kick some ass and get revenge and all for the right reasons as it comes to be the story line is great keeps you in the movie dont even get me started on the directionits tarantino so no need to go in to detail there if you have seen any of hims movies then you get it the actingdamn i recently watched uma in crazy super ex girlfriend and i just couldnt grip that this was the same woman who played the bride like reallyso i mean shes super talented and so is everyone else of course special shout out to lucy on that oneloved her great to see her play a villain and not a happy go lucky kinda person for a changeanyway watch this movie you wont regret it well unless you dont like good action good acting good direction good story lines etc you get,cruel
vanity projects are usually made by people who after receiving a lot of praise and support for their work want to make something that is personal to them and therefore dont really care what anyone thinks of it in the process usually because they wrongly believe that people will still eat it up due to the artist behind the project rather than the art itself sadly this often means that they are terrible in every sense of the word due to a lack of quality control due to a poor storyline no character development and a lot of sadistic violence this film is no exception to this rulethe story is that a woman only known as the bride has been left in a coma after her old assassin posse knocked her unconscious and killed mostly everyone at her wedding day including her husband to be and potentially her unborn daughter after awakening from this coma she seeks bloody revenge against them killing them one by one while the story is a simple revenge plot it becomes overly convoluted as tarintino adopts a non linear structure to the film but unlike his previous films that had a similar structure some parts of the film lack context to the events on screen and you feel very lost as if there was a previous instalment to this that you missedthe rest of the writing is equally inept none of the characters are very developed and it is hard to care about anyone because of it there are also a lot of plot holes throughout the story as well including how the police never bother showing up despite the violent murders that the bride commits ie killing a doctor but never bothering to hide his body killing a mother in front of her own daughter the massacre in the japanese restaurant at the end or how lucy liu got to the head of the yazuka the japanese mafia despite having awful bodyguards and fighting skills that are adequate at best the fact that there are many pointless scenes here as well dont help as they often slow down the story and bore you mainly the animated sceneanother major problem is how casually the film wallows in its sadistic violence people are decapitated eyes are pulled out people see their families murdered and limps are often cut off however the violence isnt displayed in an ott manner but rather in a more serious way with people screaming in agony and wriggling around like worms when their legs are chopped off that isnt fun violence but rather deeply unpleasant and needless carnage it strikes me as odd how the game manhunt released at a similar time is yelled at for being too violent but noone bats an eye at this despite it being perhaps worse as unlike manhunt it lacks any context and is just sadism for sadisms sake sadism also extends to other areas as well like a doctor who rapes comatose patients and a guy getting his head slammed into a door for information its utterly grotesque and while not morally bankrupt like natural born killers is per say still makes you feel dirty after seeing itthere are some good things here to though mainly that of the production design sets are gorgeous and are beautifully shot and the hd version i saw makes them feel more alive and colourful the soundtrack by wutang clan rapper rza is great too and compliments the asain influences of the film very well the acting is also quite good with all actors giving much better performances than the film deservessadly however those good things dont make a whole as the films flaws completely sink it due to poor storytelling characters and handling of violence becoming sadistic for the sake of it it is because of this that i would find it very hard to recommend to anyone except die hard tarantino fans and adolescents nitwits who dont know any better tarantino is a great filmmaker and he can do so much better than this slock but thanks to a complete lack of scrutiny and quality control he wastes his talent on self indulgent vanity projects like this critics and audiences many continue to dump praise onto this based on the goodwill tarantino earned through his early work but the awfulness of work like this demonstrates that goodwill doesnt excuse dreadful dreck avoid at all costs,cruel
now this is a masterpiecevery well directed by my favourite directorquentin tarantinoand this movie is just amazing i cant describe itwell first off let me say that just about anyone can enjoy itbecause there are three main types of movie fans1there are the people who only care about very very violent and gory moviesif a movie is extremely violent but has a awful storyawful endingawful actors they still would love the movie2there is the person who would judge the movie about amount of violence and the storyline meaning if it was a love story he would hate it3there is the stern critic who doesnt care about if it is action or horror or romance but judges everything about itwell fits all three tastes it is extremely violenthas a very cheesy but somehow amazing storyline the whole thing was amazing i definitely recommend it,cruel
it might be a really good movie to the martial arts fans but i have to say this is the worst piece of st i have seen in ages i cant believe i read a review involving the lord of the rings tlotr cant even be compared to this honestly i dont know how anybody found this appealingand to top it off they made a second one is like watching charlies angels all over again crap with bad acting  awful storyline and well is basically like watching one of those chinese fake as movies where the main fights 1000000 opponents and wins honestly quentin get real leave that kind of stuff for the asians and stick to some western stuffto conclude yes i did not like the movie and i am a movie maniac i rarely say a movie is bad but come on in this case i had too i have to say compared to atlantic rim well i would give that a 200 stars and i gave this movie a 3 star rating rather kind of me well thats all peace fellas,cruel
prior to the movies being released quentin tarantino was known as a guy great at making modern gangster movies but this movie shows clearly him having a good grasp on other genresin tarantino is able to step into more genre type of movies and does it with a splash bringing together some of the best martial arts fight scenes outside of hong kong movies a strong female lead who empowers women to be more then just a cute little thing on the arms of their menlucy liu does a great job as one of the fellow assassins who eventually becomes the most powerful crime lord of the yakuza in japantarantino borrows a lot of stuff straight out of bruce lee movies to pay homage to him and other movies of that nature,cruel
there is no doubt that quentin tarrantino is an extremely talented director in terms of editing cinematography and the overall look of a film just take the extraordinary scene in amazingly choreographed where uma thurman dispatches over a hundred swordsman in a matter of minutes its simply incredible whats more tarrantino as one of the masters of film history takes his knowledge of film genres and improves on each one of them he mixes all kinds of styles including kung fu japanese samurai and anime italian spaghetti westerns and the black exploitation films of the 70s and comes up with his own inventive hybriddespite the sheer inventiveness of vol 1 its really an exercise in style over substance tarrantino is more interested in creating an homage to these various genres as opposed to a parody and i think thats the problem notice there are virtually no laughs in unless you consider all the exaggerated decapitations and limbs being chopped off to be funny tarrantino actually takes delight in these grade c gorefests of yesteryear and attempts to elevate these pictures to high art instead of trying to emulate a great master like ingmar bergman tarrantino chooses to revel in the mindless violence of samurai swordsman and kung fu fighters most of it is harmless stuff the kind of mindless action scenes that most adolescents will take delight in but occasionally tarrantino crosses the line into the netherworld of bad taste im thinking of that wholly inappropriate scene toward the beginning of the picture when uma thurman kills one of her rivals with a young child watchingits quite clear from the outset that character motivation is virtually ignored in vol 1 as uma thurmans bride dispatches members and underlings of the deadly viper assassination squad we come to learn that she has taken revenge on the associates of bill after he betrays her at her own wedding we never learn the circumstances as to why the bride is betrayed occasionally tarrantino serves up a few surprises such as when the orderly allows customers to rape the comatose uma or matsumotos pedophilia the crime lord who lucy liu does in but overall there are few surprises in volume 1 we move from one revenge killing to anotherall the frenzied killing scenes tend to bleed no pun intended into one anothervol 2 supposedly provides the back story but what were left with in volume 1 are comic book characters who we simply cannot care about everyone is fearless as they try to do one another in in tarrantinos comic book world the guardians of morality are powerlessthats why law enforcement only makes the briefest of appearances at the beginning of the filmwhen the bride travels to okinawa and meets her mentor hattori hanzo i found that all the pious pronouncements about the spirituality of the samurai to be pretentious and out of place in a film that places the highest value on dismemberment for its own sake whats more all the serious pseudospirituality slows the pacing of the film down considerablytarrantino represents the embodiment of the american cinema today hes exciting technically savvy with a healthy respect for the history of film but at the same time his films only offer up a superficial and seductive examination of evil in the world today if tarrantino was a comedian he best could be likened to the three stoogeshis adroitly choreographed gorefests are akin to the stooges pieintheface slapstick routines tarrantino is the perennial adolescent continually caught with his hand in the cookie jar vol 1 is nice to look at but is much easier on the eyes than on the mind,cruel
all this because a woman wanted to start a new life with a guy who owned a record store so she wanted to have his baby is that so bad why the endless praise i will never understandthis is merely tarantinos constant glorification of killinghatchets flying through the air hands heads arms being removed no one with a gun she kills a hundred people and no one ever thought to just shoot her this movie is complete bunk no better example of why there soon will be no real film industrycatch the top job performance by old trooper michael parks then he may have a different part in volume 2hey this is a decent movie to just watch but no hollywood masterpiece the single best part of this movie is listening to those great old songs they were made to fit in perfectly with the killing,cruel
i am surprised with the glowing reviews that this film is gettingit definitely is a highly overrated moviei must say i was disappointed with the moviei had anticipated to see some outstanding action scenes and martial art fights in this moviebut it was a big let downthe action sequences were mediocre at bestthere is lot of bloodshed in this movie which largely looks fake and artificialthe acting is also not overly remarkablethere is no deeper meaning in this movieit also lacks emotional appealalso there is too much brutal violence just for the sake of itthis movie is different than usual hollywood action movies but that does not make it a better movie,cruel
i dont really understand the point of this movie you can say all you want about slick filmmaking style and postmodern commentary on exploitation films of the 70s but it still doesnt disguise that this film has not one ounce of originalityit doesnt comment on the movies it parodies in any significant way it just sort of copies them in an exaggerated fashion imagine if you will taking leatherface from the texas chainsaw massacre making him ten feet tall now imagine that every time he touches something with his chainsaw gallons of blood spurt out and instead of four or five kids there are twenty is kind of like this its action scenes arent funny or exciting or insightful they are just over the top at no time did i ever think wow that was cool occasionally we get an interesting plot deviation and this is where the movie usually picks up for a bit but then unfortunately it never follows up and we get back into the revenge plot this plot just leads from one lifeless action scene to the nextnow one thing i hate is a martial arts movie with poor martial arts this isnt the worst that i have ever seen but its pretty uninspiring i dont know what kind of background uma thurman has but she generally looks lost in the fights instead of a exciting kinetic experience it looks as if you are watching the half speed rehearsalseven tarantinos famed dialogue fails here there are very good moments mostly in 2 but mostly it falls flat because it is constrained by what he is trying to do the revenge plot dialogue is just too cheesy and once again not in a good way it just seems stilted and uninteresting eyerollingly bad at points especially the silly rabbit line during lucy luis fight sceneone thing you cant argue with however is the technique this film is a masterwork of lighting and camera work set design costuming and sound design are all top notch really good choice in color this film is great to watch with the sound turned off just to study the picturei would suggest that people watch this movie at least once just because it is in the popular culture but dont expect pulp fiction its more like the fourth room without tim roth,cruel
bad fatally clichd story bad directing over the top violence boring locations clichd music quentin should not try to redo much superior stories after the disastrously boring jackie brown i had hoped that qt would return with an actually watchable movie  but i was dead wrong good points are few but uma isnt totally worthless and some of the dialogue is actually quite clever but those points dont make a movie especially when qt tries to cram everything into it even a lame manga segment i can honestly say that the only film which i have seen recently that is worse than this one is once upon at time in mexico by roberto rodriguez stay away at all costs,cruel
warning spoilersplays out like a music video of violence that for one should not be taken seriously  the gore which ramps up to its climatic ending with lucy liu has all the makings of a black humor  and unlike reservoir dogs which was a movie about pure arrogance and brutality tarantino wants you to laugh over the unreality of the violence which is unabashedly over the top endless subplots of rising to the top by exacting revenge on the bottom feeders fits the motif of your everyday revenge movie  he charaterizes his victims deaths in almost comicbook fashion   when blood is shown and plenty of it is displayed it unnaturally flows out of the victims bodies like office sprinkler systems  again symbolic of a black humorthe acting in my mind was subpar but only due to the lack of dialogue in one aspect the lack of conversation keeps the movies theme pure to its form  in another it reduces the movie to little more than mere visuals the barefooted allgirl japanese band was interesting however the music was bad almost to the insanely badwhen a director gets notariaty it is common for critics to compare all continuing work to whatever was his or her best film  for quentin this is unfair because his 2nd film pulp fiction may be one of the best films of the last 10 years  unfortunately falls very short of his true gemif there are any redeeming qualities to this film it would have to be the wonderful camera perspectives quentin creates  the split screen cinematography the japanese anime although a little bit on the long side and the satirical representation of the samurai by having the martial arts injected with 70s music a la chips is interesting and unique  the final fight scenes especially the one where the some 200 plus 3piece suited samurai take on uma is a deliberate attempt by quentin to get you to say oh st this is unbelievable  well i must admit even though it struck me as a copycat of the matrix battle between neo and the army of mr smiths i did enjoy the absurd battleit is in the absurdities that mr tarantino excels at his craft  and yet tarantinos devotion to the shock and schlock has started to unfold a familiar pattern  has he become predicatble in his unpredictability perhaps  eventually he will have to change this formula because otherwise he will have to outdo himself after every film within his thus far limited genre and thats usually a recipe for directorial disaster  however for now tarantino seems to have a good command of the box officethe movie delivers on the mindless action that the title would suggest so if you are a tarantino fan you will not be disappointed  but if you are a fan of a good movie or a fan of diversity you will be somewhat disappointed for tarantino fails though just barely on both marksgrade  c,cruel
im sorry but im afraid i cant even write up much of a review for thisputting effort into this would be about as likely as the effort put forth making this movievery little im a huge tarantino fan but this movie was appallingly bad i know it was supposed to be a bit campybut this was too much mediocre acting bad script middle of the road to bad sp effects and over all so completely unbelievablybad def in the top 10 worst modern movies ive ever had the displeasure to sit thru ill avoid the next parts like the plague and to think each actor and actress in this movie barring the nickle and dime part playersare much better than they showed in this work and tarantino is also much better than this failure would lead us to believe go figure,cruel
was completely forgettable the min i left the theater the movie was waste of time with poor bland casting not one memorable scene as with the countless  of memorable scenes in his other moviesqt made some good movies but when he makes a bad movie call him on it in your comments dont defend some celebrity you dont even know on the merits of earlier more creative work thats rediculous and sad thats what really goin on here that movie sucked by qt movie  standards and you people who defend it suck for encouraging qts futher downward spiral into  a brief vh1 ilove the 90s segment now go get me a royale with cheese b6,cruel
i have loved all the tarintino films but this is his worst film the digital effects were not that hot thurman was good but it lacks the real black humour of the his earlier films having said this im really looking forward to seeing what he does next,cruel
spoilers   spoilers so now we know why the fourth film from quentin tarantino had to become the fourth and fifth films from quentin tarantino  he said that a 3 hour grindhouse kung fu movie would be pretentious  well yes but only because what youve started with is pretentious to begin with  in this first hour and a half so little happens its unbelievable  i cant believe that he couldnt have got it down to a decent running timeid have been willing to take uma thurmans escape from the hospital as read but quentin has to show us her wiggling her big toe for minutes on end  we spend ages watching people get places  umas journey to track down oren ishii for example which takes ages  theres a scene with a texan sheriff which does nothing  we get a lengthy partanimated introduction to oren ishii a character who we already know is going to be dead soon anyway  the use of animation is inspired i admit but i just dont care about the story it shows  what else  well the whole sonny chiba sequence is superfluous  again id have been quite happy for her just to get a sword from somewhere  i dont need this man to argue about coffee although i did enjoy some of the dialogue im not bald i just shaved my headso ok hes written too much  but annoyingly hes directed too much as well  quentin has always stood on a knifeedge when it comes to overdirecting but here he tumbles over it  every time the bride sees someone she wants to kill the star trek klaxon starts blaring which is irritating  also her name gets blurred every time someone says it which is just silly  david carradines hands give a great performance which is slightly tiresome  he tells the story out of order as always and you can sort of see why  but just occasionally it hinders rather than helps were we supposed to see oren ishiis name already crossed out on that list and the pussy wagon gets a laugh sure but would have got a better one is we first saw it when uma first sees it  and as for the fightoh lets get to the big fight sequence now  hyped beyond belief this is uma thurman battling 88 people or something  could have been great isnt  i still like it better than matrix reloadeds socalled burly brawl because theres no annoying cgi here  but after a while i realised id zoned out  it just wasnt doing it for me  partly because he decided to switch to blackandwhite which is just pointless  and partly becausewell theres two issues here  one is that i have never seen a socalled grindhouse kung fu movie  i have no idea what tradition he is reprising i only know who sonny chiba is through true romance  so this movie is not can not be targeted at methe other issue is about violence  theres just too much of it  and i dont often say that  but it loses any effect after a while  it becomes boring  and it occasionally becomes distasteful  when gogo  gets whammed in the head with a plank of wood with a nail through it her death is lovingly filmed  hes savouring it  whether its different because these are women isnt an argument im going to get into right now frankly but when it comes to violence qt has always been master of implication the earsevering and of the short sharp shock marvins death  he almost entirely abandons these in for grand guignol lopping off of limbsit doesnt work  his geysers of blood and choppedoff arms only remind me of monty python and the holy grail while lucy lius deathoh dear  i found ray liottas scenes at the end of hannibal to be hilariously bad and our sighting of oren ishiis brain at the end of this film pretty much tops even thatback to distastefulness  the pregnant bride is beaten up shot and put into a coma for 4 years waking to find her baby gone  i think thats enough but no she has to have been raped continuously for 4 years too  this is another superfluous sequence  i could have stood it if it hadnt been treated almost as an amusing aside  one rapist is killed by having his tongue bitten off in a comical way  the other has his head banged in a door  these people especially buck are as sick and evil as the viper squad if not more so yet she hardly seems bothered about itso what keeps it from instant 110 status well its a quentin tarantino movie  and hes still got it  not all the time far from it  but there are a fair few moments that remind me of glory days  actually what with the excellent use of splitscreen and cameras passing over the set walls they remind me most of brian de palma circa snake eyes but thats not a criticism  the film starts promisingly with my favourite scene uma thurman versus vivica a fox  the gun in the cereal is a classic tarantino moment there are memorable motifs like the pussy wagon and umas bruce leeaping tracksuit  lucy liu isnt far off from being a revelation and its nice to see daryl hannah resurrected in a role not a million miles away from her bladerunner daysso have i given up on quentin tarantino  no  not quite  ill wait till his next film sorry  his one but next film i doubt ill bother will volume 2  because i think this is just something hes been needing to get out of his system  hes always wanted to make this movie and now he has well done  if he doesnt now move on and make some movies i want to see rather than movies quentin tarantino or clarence worley wants to see then he and i will say byebye,cruel
ok well i went to see this movie the day after it came out im sorry to say it was one of the worst movies since the master of disguise im sorry but the only thing worse then computer generated fight scenes are unrealistic ones the fight seen in which she comes for lucy lui and had to battle her entourage made me want to walk out it was one of the worst fight scenes i had seen since the matrix reloaded now the blood i also found incredibly stupid when u stab sumone u dont bleed like that nor is it cool to make sumone appear to bleed that way now the fight seen with vivica was very good up until the part where she shot out of the cereal box uma was so dead it wasnt even funny then she magically pulls a knife out of nowhere and kills her right as her daughter walks in but through all of this i could have lived but the part of the movie that made me want to throw my extra large bucket of popcorn at the screen was the scene in the pussy wagon in which she insisted on moving her big toe now i dont care who you are u cannot go from a coma to a fully functional body in a day much less a few hours now for my respect of quentin i going to lay off the idiotic idea of adding the rape scene in all comments aside the fight scene with her and lucy was one of my favorites ever the head being chopped off was in no way to much quentin i feel ya on wanting to branch out but u went a little too extreme on this one,cruel
reservoir dogs and pulp fiction hit a chord with filmgoers  an imaginative script and fresh storytelling were a breath of fresh air in the stale environment of contemporary filmmaking  however what many predicted has come to pass  tarantino has revealed his lack of depth and world view what was thought to be a keen insight into universal truths has turned out to be just visual glibnessit has been stated that is an homage to the martial arts genre if it is it is no more useful than an homage to oilonvelvet paintings the martial arts genre is about nothing other than exotic cinematic action pretending to be treatises on honor and revenge  tarantino has tried to say that this is important in the grand world view of things if revenge is the theme then it would have been better to copy the films of kurosawawhile tarantino obviously has a vast knowledge of films due to his years of watching videos he lacks as a filmmaker a world education  hinted at in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and clarified by is the fact that tarantino knows very little about the world human life human desires and love  he is the outsider looking in  looking through distorted glass  and trying to copy what he sees  trying to copy and do one better the martial arts genre is the perfect example of someone with a very narrow cinematic vocabulary who has run out of wordsit was extremely disappointing to see a filmmaker squander a chance at making a quantum leap in storytelling  instead tarantino has returned to his lonely room and engaged in cinematic masturbation,cruel
spoiler alert spoiler alertis an arty revenge flick style over substance is putting it mildly is no substance and all style it hurts me to say that because this flick has all the movie elements that i would normally find quite enjoyable a girl in a school uniform attacking with a mace and chain sounds great so whats my problem tarantino may be a fervent admirer of exploitation movies but he doesnt have the guts to go all the way and actually make onethis movie was written and directed by quentin tarantino this movie was made for an audience of one quentin tarantino  he is the absolute master in constantly reminding the audience that they are watching a movie a tarantino movie the violence in is plentiful and bloody but its presented in a stylish way that drains away the impact in other words you know that the violence is fake see its all movieviolence none of the blood and guts has anything to do with real life see severed heads fly off while blood spurts out of the bad guys necks like a monty python skit youve got action scenes that switch from color to black and white an anime sequence and samurai uma fighting bad guys in front of a blue screen these and other tarantino showoff touches dilute the violence and turn into a toothless bloody comedyid go 510 on it did have a girl attacking with a mace and chain i have to like it on some level but tarantino cannot play an action scene straight everything has to be done for laughs soon vol 2 of will be unleashed oh goody so many questions left unanswered in vol 1 like wheres the rest of the movie,cruel
i guess what i hate most about this movie is its silly attempt at passing for a movie to be taken seriously i found many of the scenes to be visually repulsive but that wasnt what bothered me most what bothered me most was the underlying message of those scenes when someone was cut to pieces with a sword the focus was on how cool it looks when someone is cut to pieces  as opposed to movies like braveheart where the focus was on scotlands struggle for independence i felt genuinely offended by this it is also clear that either tarantino has absolutely no knowledge of human anatomy or the clumsily splattered bodies in the movie was some sort of deranged form of artistic expression if the latter is true than mr tarantino has no knowledge of how to create serious artistic movies or how to create any form of art deserving of respect as it was in no way beautiful and served no purpose in telling the story and was generally very repulsive it is mr tarantinos vein attempt at passing himself of as a serious artist witch bothers me most also very offensive and disgusting was the music chosen to accompany the splatter scenes beautiful classical music this is an attempt to glorify the splatter scenes something witch should never be done in serious artwork disgusting bloody scenes are supposed to underline some story plot but not be gloried in themselves that is the mark of bad art if you want to see a serious movie that is artistically made see kaldaljs  cold light or englar alheimsins angels of the universe i am shocked at how high this movie is rated on this page as it is pure crap please for the love of god do not see this garbage ,cruel
whilst browsing imdb for the film first blood i found this film recommended along side it first blood is a classic film has plenty of action good actors and whilst it may be predictable it is very enjoyable however is total trash i have never seen 2 and dont ever plan to unless someone tells me that there is an apology from the director for making such an awful film the acting is atrocious the effects even worse and the mix of cartoon and film sucks i can truly say that this is the worse film i have ever seen it even beats vanilla sky with tom cruise and thats saying something dont be fooled by the high votes this film has received im baffled you will be wasting your money,cruel
in general im not really a fan of quentin tarantinos to me his films seem to have a kind of smirking selfconsciousness a smug cool cleverness to them that irritates me however to his credit reservoir dogs and to a lesser extent pulp fiction did have a few moments of dialog that i actually thought were almost as clever as tarantino obviously thought they were but not a clever line in sight quite the opposite really the film contained what had to be some of the dumbest dialog i have ever heard the whole film was like a continuous stream of terrible oneliners and recycled kungfu clichs i know i know a lot of people found it entertaining but personally i found it rather boring in its own hyperadrenaline way i need a bit of substance in my films for me to find them engaging and really can you honestly say that had anything resembling substance did it even have a real plot that takes more than a sentence to explain or even an original interesting idea this movie is all flash and flash alone doesnt get you anywhere in my book,cruel
quentin tarantinos fourth feature film is a rollicking rampage of revenge fast brutal and stylish the film reunites some of qts favorite elements from wellknown asian martial arts films with an american twist but have no fear people of japanquentin pays true respect to the classics of the genre and the individuals who made them he takes what most audiences are unfamiliar with and presents the varying shreds of material as a splendid mainstream whole even down to segments of animesure we have had to wait for another installment because of fat cat harvey weinstein who was after the big bucks when he suggested the film be split into two separate volumes but i think i actually prefer as two pieces it just builds up the public appreciation for the film and provides us with a good catcher and a hanging end the matinee serials that indiana jones paid homage to used to do the same thingi see no true problem with it although i dont feel that having to pay for extra tickets to see the rest of the movie is a move made without marketing behind itits been a long six years since jackie brown and for quentin its all been spent on trying to make this movie get made his breakthrough was with 1992s reservoir dogs one of the greatest films of all time and his 1994 modernday masterpiece pulp fiction truly named him one of the best directors of this generation he has proved he can also act too in some of these filmsjackie brown a very good movie but admittedly not a great one disappointed many of quentins fans and so he has spent all of this time since that feature film trying to bring to the screen an idea that originated during filming of pulp fiction when he created the films tagline almost ten years ahead of schedulewhat he does with separates him from being another onehitwonder director isnt as realistic or perhaps even as meaningful as his other films but its a masterpiece in its own right filled with excessive bloody violence and revenge fantasies that come true we all wish for a bit of revenge now and again some of us get it and some of us dontthe bride uma thurman decides that she wants to get even with the people who tried to assassinate her four years ago and shell stop at nothing until she does the bride whose real name we never firmly grasp was massacred by the deadly viper assassination squad michael madsen lucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah at the altar four years ago bill david carradine was behind it all you find me sadistic dont you but four years pass and the bride wakes up from a long deep comatose some of her first thoughtsthey killed nine people they should have killed tentheres not much you can say about a movie like without giving away important plot points or funny moments much of the film relies upon uma thurman to keep it afloat and she impressed me very much with this movie some of her oneliners and deadpan expressions will go down in cinema history as some of the bestand funniest your names buck and youre here totarantino has stuffed full of martial arts references tarantino who used to work at a video store before he directed reservoir dogs is a huge fan of movies and hes admitted to watching on average two or three a day hes a film buffs director a guy who actually knows something about film even the brides outfit she wears throughout much of the movie is that in bruce lees final movieits a disgrace that those hobbits received oscars over a much more exciting involving and relatable movie im sorry but although i found the lord of the rings well made it was also a large knockoff of other films from the genre and i think jackson tried to bring too much depth to a story that simply has very little i cant relate to hobbits and wizards on magical quests we can all relate to revenge and im going to get a lot of nasty letters for saying thatbut tarantino has delivered a truly original film and one that should have been nominated for among others best original screenplay best picture best actress and best director im sorry but its true because this is a finer and more original film than any of the lord of the rings installment despite how much of an impact they have hadthis shouldnt turn into a rant which is why i am going to end my review by saying that is a film unlike anything i have ever seen yep its pretty strange but its also pretty fun and extremely well made quentin hasnt disappointed after leaving the theater i couldnt wait to see volume 2 and im already counting the weeks until its release55top ten of 2003 2john ulmer,cruel

this has got to be the worst movie i have seen in a looooooooooong time it was nothing but mindless fightscenes and violence the story was pathetic and the fightscenes were just ridiculousi dont understand how this movie got such rave reviews as personally i thought it was pure crapi give it a 1 out of 10,cruel
seriously i have no idea why tarentino is thought of as a good director none of his movies show any evidence to support his reputation from what ive seen  as for this specific onewhat a mess and not just talking about the excessive pointless violence the scenes are played with next to no logical order or coherence  most of the action shots as well choreagraphed as they are have such sloppy camera work you practically get motion sickness  the plot such as it is makes abosolutely no sense well the bride is out for revenge obviously but why she was attacked in the first place was never explained  the anime sequence was actually pretty well done but was followed up with a long drawn out transition to the next sequence which is what most of the movie felt like incoherent drawn out scenes with periods of rediculously violent sloppy action sequences to wake you up  maybe volume 2 will redeem this first half but im not holding my breath,cruel
uma thurman was totally unconvincing as a martial artist in this movie then again so was every nonjapanese person in the film the fight scene between uma and vivica fox was edited in such a rapidfire manner to hide the fact that neither of them could fight worth beans during the big scene with the 100 agent smiths oops i mean the crazy 88 gang she swung that sword around with all the finess of a major league ball player aiming for the fence only when her stunt double took over did we see some decent moves i thought maybe lucy liu would put up a decent fight but that one was also disappointing the only one with any sort of promise was the character of gogo but she didnt last long enough to really get into it so in vol 2 shes going to kill daryl hannah michael madson and david carradine hmmm so those fight scenes are going to suck too overall i liked the movie but they could have at least put some time into training as the nonmartial artists in the matrix did,cruel
if you have become completely desensitized to extreme blood  guts and the rape of a comatose woman this is the film for you i dont know what happened after that because i had had enough it is only the 2nd film i have ever walked out on this is the worst piece of crap i have seen in years i love martial arts  action films but this is simply violence for the sake of violence with blood flowing everywhere this film panders to the lowest levels of our society with deference to those who saw some artistic value to this film do more blood  guts make a better movie apparently it does for many but how far can it go is there ever a limit,cruel
i enforced me not to leave before the movie ends too much violence no technic improvement ugly scenes simple plot i cannot not find any positive aspect from this movie this is the worst movie i have seen this year 1 out of 10,cruel
volume one is by far one of my favorite movies also i am a huge fan of quentin tarantinos work i love the fact that he has a story line within a story line and creates a dreamy affect within all his movies also i appreciated a lot of the martial art references and acts through out the film i think the movie is really empowering to woman as well as revenge and how its done in such a tasteful way i also love that the movie is action packed and gives you an adrenaline rush straight from the beginning of the movie as usual quentin tarantino also supplies you with amazing music that always goes perfect with each scene its definitely a must see movie if you enjoy any type of adrenaline rush and action packed films,cruel
im not one to feel passionately about movies but after buying this film on bluray i would be ashamed to even use it as a coaster the plot couldnt be any more shallow then one written by a five year old heres the movie in a nutshell a woman is victim of a hitsquad she manages to survive and plans to kill all those responsible i actually liked qts other movies eg pulp fiction reservoir dogs but this movie was pathetic i dont understand why so many others are willing to praise the film as genius the idea that this is worthy of a sequel is laughable oh and one other thing there is a terribly cheesy and unnecessary character expose of one of the assassins and her bodyguard that made me want to cringea movie that is only gore equals total borestoryplot 010 camerawork 610 music 810 costumesset 410,cruel
kurosawa apparently thought a two second swordfight was more interesting than a twenty minute swordfight i think any two seconds of toshiro mifune eating rice is more interesting than the two ninety minute swordfights called i enjoy violent movies and violence generally and i am in fact a violent person but this is art and you have to earn it spectacle is a fine thing but its a matter of taste what entertainment value i may derive from watching a pregnant woman shot in the head or hearing about her years of comatose anal rape this movie does not offer masturbation is by definition a waste of time and can be identified and judged categorically without regard to taste colored lights do not a pretty picture make switching from black  white to color to japornimation does not a story tell and the occasional witty line about sodomy does not this viewer amuse for three hours with cluttered shots redundant supporting characters tired story lines gaudy and extraneous sets and costumes spasmodic editing and protagonists lacking in basic dynamics kills itself but not fast enough,cruel
this was the first movie that i watched from tarantino and presumably the last onei had never seen such a disaster which is called moviewhen tarantino finished this movie announced in an interview that i love to make mad movies that is the best word for the movie and its directorthis is a film that just mad will make it and a mad will enjoy watching ifirst problem is about the story the character of ema is in the coma and so funny soooooo funny she gets ride of it bye a mosquito bite it seems that during these years no mosquito was allowed to com in the room because of the directors script after she gets up although there has been for years that she even has not moved her body suddenly she starts moving herself the only problem is about the feet and also since her feet have ears their listen to her order and start working after that other scenes of movie are so long and boring like the scenes in the japanese caf that is so long with a horrible mixed music that the viewer gos to heave the last part which is so horrible is about the actions while she is fighting to take her revenge without any wisely reason from everywhere so many of the bills servants are attackingthe fighting also is so boring without any creativity and originality so after all it is so nice to say dont watch this movie if you think your time is valuable,cruel
well as i predicted quentin finally made a fool of himself as he tried to resurrect from the ashes making the  in his own mind  ultimate action movie he kind of invented a certain spoofactionviolencewitty dialogheavy artillery movie genrekind of because in reality he remains forever in debt to pioneers like scorsese and the hong kongaction movie makers which he remixed into a seemingly brilliant farcekind of moviefilmmaking style and then pursues this approach to absolute death because as everyone can observe quentins productions kept diluting themselves of substance until they finally dried up to become this pathetic and uninspired crappy hong kong action movies ripoffsoapopera with uninspired dialog and shitty actionits actually sad to watch quentins cinematic freefall especially after his somehow significant contribution to modern cinema mostly in a screenwriter capacitynatural born killers true romance in his early years but as it looks he just has nothing more to saywhats next pulp fiction 2 pulp fiction 3perhaps its about time to think about early retirement quentin,cruel
avoid this movie at all costs it is garbage it is pornographic in the true sense of the wordkilling bill is about blood and guts and killing my repeated reaction while watching the movie was unmitigated disgustkilling bill is pornographic this is the most accurate description the movie is offensive to people with normative valueskilling bill has no plot no character development and what little dialogue there is is completely forgettablethe movie opens with thurman killing another woman while the victims 6 year daughter watches unbelievably from that point onwards it actually gets worsekilling bill was thought up by uma thurman and quentin tarantino while they were making pulp fiction in 1994 pulp fiction is a violent movie killing bill is a thousand times worsethurman clearly enjoys her sadistic role in killing bill which leads me to think that she needs professional help tarantino should join her i keep asking myself what prompted these two people to invest so much of themselves in a movie that glorifies death by decapitation and the cutting off of limbsi wont go to another movie in which uma thurman appears or that tarantino directs the public and the reviewers liked killing bill and its box office success is indicative of the herd mentality of american film goers no matter how bad how revolting how repulsive or how disgusting a movie is american film goers will flock to see it if the movie is properly marketed they are totally undiscriminating tell them that watching someone get disemboweled is good entertainment and they will flock to the theatersavoid this movie i expect that the sequel killing bill 2 is the same,cruel
ill start off by saying that no in general i am not a tarantino fan i thought pulp fiction was a very good movie i havent seen reservoir dogs and though from dusk till dawn was worthless trash second of all im reviewing both vol 1  2 herewas a cinematic success exclusively because of the fact that movies are very rarely created for artistic or commentary purposes anymore  now they are mostly just created for young teenage boys who want to see some heads chopped off with a couple sex scenes mixed in unfortunately for them doesnt have any of the latter but it has ohsoplenty of the formeri dont care about violence in movies im no self righteous conservative schmuck who thinks that all movies should supplement the family environment and any showing of blood should be met with a swift nc17 rating violence is alright in movies as long as there is something to go along with it as long as theres a point to it sorry but a clichd and uninspired tale of bloody revenge to get back at your husband by chopping up a couple hundred asian kids and plucking peoples eyes out just doesnt cut itmuch of the dialogue is overly simple and somewhat pointless i think the star of the movie is lucy liu as she has by far the most character and likabilityhateability as oren ishii who also happens to be the most well developed of the characters in the film the only one with any backstory even provided the scene in the conference room with tanaka losing his head and her subsequent shouting and the final fight scene of vol 1 between the bride and oren are by far the best in the duology its just too bad that lucy is only in the first movie i would venture to say that the second movie isnt worth seeing just because she isnt in it butid be wrong because there are many many other reasons not to see itfurther evidence that this movie was marketed exclusively for mostly immature teenagers is the character pai mei obviously based on the master characters from various anime shows he was clearly tossed in there for kids to look at and say look he chops wood with his hand and ninja slaps women without regret therefore he is badass unfortunately that doesnt work how about the fivepointheartexsplosiontechnique how long winded and childish can you get for the name of a martial arts move youve got to be kidding me with that one how can you expect me to hear a character say wow you just used the fivepointheartexplosiontechnique on me and not burst into uncontrollable laughter i think that scene almost got me kicked out of the theater the ushers and the people around me didnt look to pleased at my laughing during what i think was supposed to be a dramatic scene but failed to be sothe soundtrack for the movie is fairly good it consists of the usual tarantino audio obscure songs from previously unknown artists that doesnt seem to fit with the scene on your first view but you come to appreciate its cinematic value later theres lots of salsa music on there too mostly from santa esmerelda which definitely worked with the final fight scene between oren and the bride the 5 6 7 8s should thank tarantino that vonage didnt laugh them off the stage like every movie audience did  i wonder how much theyre getting from those commercials were it not for the hype rampant undeserved praise and general overratedness would simply be a decent movie i mean there arent many movies out there with a deep intuitive affecting story anyways so its sometimes forgivable but the millions of people saying is the best and then when asked to answer the question of why respond with simply women cutting people up with swords why do you think dinglehopper is what just gets to me cutting things up with swords is not a good movie id rather just watch the home shopping network and see the untrained salesmen accidentally impale themselves with a sword while trying to market it because they try to look fancy but dont actually know how to handle it now that is entertainment  is just junki think and all its undeserved popularity is a grim sign for the movie industry  final overwhelming confirmation that action sells over artits not an unknown fact that the movies that are made for artistic meaning and offer some type of commentary on the status of human society or just what life really is are almost overwhelmingly neglected by the moviegoing audience and are seen mostly by critics and fans of the directors and when the rare movie comes along that offers blood gore story acting and commentary that all combine into a piece of art such as saving private ryan people watch it for the war scenes oh that movie has some great war scenes man limbs flying everywhere  yes but theres more to it than justthat i would tell you to watch it againbut you still wouldnt get it its the blood and gore people want to see not the long complicated story great acting and much more that comes with an excellent top100 movie apparently katanawielding women in yellow jumpsuits is the fad nowadays and just a couple years ago pogs were the fadgo figure,cruel
personally im not averse to complete nonsense which this most certainly is but its got to have some kind of hook to itunless youre harbouring deep desires to be a sword murderer in which case you probably need help anyway theres better sword fighting for you out there crouching tiger  flying daggers etc in the good old us of a we like our characters to be flawed dirty and with guns something tarantino so expertly portrayed in pulp fiction et al unashamedly using many japanese techniques to great effectnow he just has made an american ninja movie something akin to going to your local skateboarderemporium and seeing your dad trying on the tshirts now hide the embarrassment by adding huge amounts of sword fighting and there you have it  ,cruel

vol 1 quentin tarantinos fourth movie everybody is talkin about because its just quentin tarantino beside the hype around this man he didnt impress me with his movies though he had some interesting ideas  until nowmade me slip back in my comfortable cinema chair thinking about the wasted time 111 minutes and money 5 eur and stupidness of following the mainstream and all the hypes well this arent the normal thoughts of the audience and i want to tell you why i thought so about this moviei went to the cinema for two reasons 1 a friend told me that is a good exploitation film like braindead  2 another one who knows me quite well and said that i will like this movie so with joyfully anticipation the whole thing started but turned me off quite fast nothing happened they shoot they kill they bleed they jump they beat whats so special not even imho poor martial arts actors like jackie chan or jet li would appreciate such useless fighting sequences and why did they pull swords in and out of the sheaths for minutes some hidden meaningis it really necessary to pack a conventional american revenge story tooth for tooth eye for eye in such an overthetop exaggerated movie with childish fightings the comicbook showdown in the restaurant useless blood flow i like gore but you must know where you gave to use it hollywood dialogues and sloppy cinematic elements the anime retrospect of oren ishiithis movie will appeal to people who have seen every karate tiger movie know the basic facts of jeanclaude van dammes life and enjoy dragon ball z on a daily basissorry people i have to give up but was the worst film i saw since scary movie 2,cruel
as being one among many that waited quite impatiently for the release of vol1 being in less than well tempered expectation hearing what buzz i could lend my ear to about what was to be of this film when all was said and done i found this film both refreshing and disapointing at the same time it seems that tarantino has been plagued with heavy expectations from audiences ever since pulp fiction just as most fans of pulp fiction i keep hoping that somehow quinten tarantino could top that masterful achievement but i have come to the conclusion that tarantino found the right chemistry actors and ideas that put pulp fiction in the category that many other films have been placed in that rare film that becomes a classic against all original odds the godfather would be a prime example of this francis ford coppola had little experience he was in constant danger of being fired from the project al pacino was bitterly hated by paramount executives early on danny thomas wanted to buy paramount pictures so he could play himself as don vito corleone studio executives constantly butted heads with coppola on just about every detail time was rushed every day of the shoot back in 1971 and the budget was very tight nobody including coppola himself ever expected that he would pull it off with anything less than bfilm results all is history now and the godfather has served as a blue print for countless projects that were to follow yet even more amazingly coppola pulled it off again and did an even more impressive job with his handling of the godfather pt ii the interesting point of this is that situations examples like coppolas two godfather films and the success there of is seldom achieved of course who can argue with the success of other classic achievements as well like the films that george lucas stanley kubrick and steven spielberg that being said it is becoming tougher and tougher for rising new directors to cut a true place in the history of film now days then along comes quinten tarantino a director who has made the unconventionalconventional just as kubrick did with a clockwork orange and 2001 a space odyssey tarantino achieved this with his first two outings however in kubricks case as an example most of his films have been percieved as classics and rightfuly so since the first two godfather films and possibly apocalypse now coppola hasnt made anything that has managed to reach those lofty hieghts since these films are perfect examples of pure directorial magic once a director makes a strong impact in hollywood with an exceptional film the gloves are off and the true challenge begins that is to saycan this guy top his opus perhaps pulp fiction may remain tarantinos opus perhaps not but until then we have the refreshing talents of a cutting edge director to debate and marvel over that being said i held my excited expectations for vol1 to a minimum as best i could hoping for a real masterpiece and a true winner of a film i bought my ticket and kept my fingers and toes crossed as the film opened it seemed that my expectations might just get met the opening credit sequence was absolutely wonderful and from there on there was allot more magic but the bottum line is that it was for the most part not the sort of magic that makes a movie a legend what i saw was refreshing exciting and beautifuly executed but yet there just seemed to be something missing i pondered this for a minute at at time even as i watched the film further i noticed alot that wasnt there allot less humor less interesting characters and over all allot less of what made pulp fiction a classic i left the theatre both fulfilled and dissapointed at the same time once i dedicated myself to expect both less and more from tarantino and excepted the film on its own terms i went to see it again and really loved it if you look at it as a whole the entire movie is a homage to everything from sleaze cinema to martial arts bfilms yet it never wavers in originality i was particularly impressed with the animation sequence it caught me totally be surprise and lets be honest how often do we see films anymore that can achieve the element of surprise with any real success i think tarantino deserves at least a peanut butter cup for that looking at it in one way i might feel compelled to suggest that perhaps vol 1 deserves four stars on the other hand the whole affair still seems less impressive than a true classic in my opinion critics should see this movie more than once before rendering any judgement i would have originally have felt compelled to give this movie 2 12 stars but the way i see it now anything less than three of them little twinklers would be a harsh example of poor criticism see the movie twice and then throw your stones if need be,cruel
plot kill a list of people terrible dialogue mundane and unappealing martial arts awful as a practicioner of iaidothe art of the sword i must honestly say that i have never seen such blatant misinterpretation of japanese culture before  i didnt see one swing which would have actually constituted an actual strike  there was hardly anyhting japanese about the movie all of the moves were from chinese martial artsthis movie is out purely for shock value and anyone who says it is an artistic masterpiece has obviously been swayed by the fancy colors and hip music i am shocked and appalled that this movie is in the 85 spot,cruel
words cannot tell how mind numbingly dumb is ok maybe they canfirst of all there is barely any plot a woman loses everthing and his shellbent on revenge whohoo to a degree the nameless main character is pityable but ultimately she is simply detestable she was an assassin for a snakethemed assassin gang code name black mambain the opening scene she is on screen bloodied up and then bill shoots her in the head instead of killing her she goes into a coma for four years and wakes up and just wants to kill everyone i was in sheer disgust within the first fifteen minutes she kills the mother of a four year old daughter in her house and then leaves nonchallant and its just stupid since when is this kind of coldblooded murder entertainmentthe film makes no attempt to be realistic as blood is spewed from every wound this is quite probably the most bloodfilled movie ever made the movie gets more and more pointless skipping around time the murder of the mother at the beginning happens after the end of the film chronologically showing copious amounts of blood the whole waythere is and oddly outofplace anime sequence detailin the history of lucy lius ren ishei the animation isnt very good and it is only there because a nine year old girl was required for the scene and it was far too needlesly violentthe movie only becomes dumber uma thurman fights a room full of 200 people and surives and the room is drenched in blood afterward one of orens henchwomen disembowels a man merely for asking if she likes ferraristhe dialog is awful especially a stupid pointless scene in a restaurant where the bride gets her sword the characters curse and swear pointlessly its all acted well enuff there is a disgusting scene around the time the bride wakes up where a nurse rapes and prostitutes the bride while comatose buck thankfully gets what he deserves from the bride but its hard to root for herill also point out that if she was in a coma for four years her muscles would be atrophied and unusable but that is convieniently ignored basically it sucks a two out of ten,cruel
before you get all excited about this movie let me say that it is the best example of tarantinos well having run dry he no longer quotes from the language of film creating his own unique text but scrambles to use others ideas hoping that a cultural divide will hide his indedescretions do yourself a favour reserve comment on this film until you have seen several of miike takashis works,cruel
this has got to be the bloodiest movie i have ever seen the special effects of the blood spurting out and the body parts lying all over is something that i have just never seen before in a movie there is also nice martial art action if you like that so good for special effects  the choreographerbut the plot is almost nonexistent one wonders what screenwriters who write movies like this do with their time most of the time in the movie is alloted to choreographers doing martial arts and special effects squirting blood and spreading body parts aroundthere are no plot twists or intrigue or mystery in this film the only thing that could be construed as mystery is why all the killing started in the first place but that question never gets answered in this movie but there is obviously a sequel because she doesnt finish all her killing theres more to come more blood squirting  body parts to be scattered around i supposei guess im just another one of those simpletons that just didnt get it i was looking for some plot development where the screenwriter would have to earn his fee but here i guess tarantino being director as well as writer along with thurman  notice she had never written for the screen before was more interested in displaying his directorial capabilities  than as a screenwriter it just hit me  tarantino was already being paid as the director so why should he spend much time writing  that would just double his workload for what would probably be the same feefrom a more serious viewpoint it is a sorry indication of how far downhill society has gone when people are so highly entertained rating of 83 at this writing with such low emotion i was actually laughing at the blood squirting but i would rather be laughing at a true comedy perhaps the blood squirting was meant to be satirical in some weird perverted way romans were entertained by feeding christians to the lions through the nineteenth century public executions were considered entertainment this movie is a throwback to those sadistic emotions and i would that society were headed in the other directioni give it a 210 for the martial arts  special effects because those are not features that attract me to a movie lack of plot  lack of concern for real entertainment take it to a 110,cruel
it is one of the worse film ive ever seen may be the worst except meaningless violence there is nothing in it and it carries no meaning dont waste your time for watching this movie,cruel
let me just say that i saw reservoir dogs before most of you were in junior high and that i am a huge fan of the old time samuri movies and david carradine was my childhood hero  that being said this movie was the most painful two hours i have experienced in years and considering that in the last two years i have experienced a vasectomy and divorce that is saying quite a bitthis movie makes more sense as a parody of itself than it does as an overstylized tribute to the kung fu movies of old  as entertaining as those movies were when i was 7 i have advanced and movie making has advanced and quality cinematography and pretty actresses does not a quality film make  perhaps if uma or lucy had been nude then there may have been something redeeming value to the 2 hours i just spent enduring this filmthe last movie that i walked out of was pink cadillac and even then i made it through 23 of it  had i not been the primary source of transportation for my 3 friends one of which had recommended this piece of brilliance i would have left inside of 15 minutesdo not bring a date to this movie it will be your last date with that person in fact do not even bring yourself to this movie if i could i would give this film 1000 out of 10 to average down the inflated reviews that all of you tarantino fanatics have giving it  yes he has had some brilliant films yes he is a visionary but when you only have 4 films to your credit and one of them is thisof the four of us who watched this thing we rated it as a 00010 giving it a solid 25 unfortunately most people who think it sucks as much as i do wont spend the time to tell you here,cruel
absolutely the most shallow film i have ever seen  yes there was style but whats the point of style without substance to back it up the gore and violence was over the top but instead of comedic i found it banal and disturbing  sure the squirting blood was funny in monty python but as with everything in comedy its only funny the first time and then it just gets lame and pretentious  tarantino tries to make a homage to martial arts anime and all sorts of b flick movies but one gets the feeling that he never understood the soul of those movies  martial arts movies are fun to watch because there isnt too much blood some anime are great because they have good storylines and b movies are fun just because they have over the top dialogue and silly stories while i have never seen other tarantino movies this one doesnt motivate me to run towards my nearest blockbuster  as someone else said this is only a juvenile fantasy unworthy of the films that it pays homage to tarantinos style is an endless amount of bloodwash and gore mixed with stolen shots it is b movies rehashed but even a homage needs some hint of originality unfortunately sadly lacks in that aspect  the worst part of all of this is that our society is so inured and cynical that we can somehow find this entertaining  what a sad commentary on american pop culture,cruel
i cannot believe that people genuinely enjoy this movie  i was yearning for the exit after the first 20 minutes  and yes i am familiar with all of the movies that tarantino is straight ripping off and i enjoyed them  this film has absolutely no narrative  it has no value  it stinks  go rent a best of asian action movie and a couple of anime flicks  youll have a better time  i swear  this movie sucked,cruel
that movie was terrible i rate this the worst movie ever i rate it below the dd movie shudders it is the only movie i have ever considered walking out on it was like a train wreak i kept watching hoping it would get better it didnt the flashback was a crappy cartoon a 12 year old have drawn and should never be compared to anime the fight scenes could have been cool if the yakuza knew how to even hold their swords correctly they used the movie ninja tactic of lets run at the hero one at a time its sad really the blood was kinda cool but the plot so boring also did were the freaking snow come from there was no snow ten minutes before to sum up this movie in a word excruciating,cruel
if it didnt cost me 10 to see this movie i would have left in the middle there was a lot of random violence which i usually like but the way it was done didnt work  i understand what he was trying to do but i expect more from the man who gave us pulp fiction  plus i hate anime and if i am going to see a movie that contains anime i want to be told before hand so i dont waste my money,cruel
four years after she was savagely beaten and shot in the head on her wedding day by her fellow members of bills deadly viper assassination squad the bride awakes from her coma swearing revenge on those who killed her baby and tried to kill her  she compiles a list and sets out after the first person on her list tokyo crime boss oren ishiion the wave of tobeexpected hype comes tarantinos latest film and what a very mixed bag it is indeed  the decision to split it into two parts is probably for the best for audiences who may not be able to cope with this for three hours plus but it may also weaken the film in a way that i cant be sure of until i see volume ii i enjoyed the film  and let me stress that for i know many seem to treat tarantinos films as a youre either for us or agin us issue  but i have some issues with itin terms of style it is faultless whether it be the camera gliding over the tops of rooms or using black and white and animation to interesting effect  in fact the opening of the film is so powerful that i actually jumped in my seat as the brides opening line was cut short  however the emphasis on style has lost sight of any meaningful substance  i hope that volume ii will bring this to the table and not just do more of the same  if it doesnt then this is a weak film if it does then it should work as a whole  i found it ironic that the only part of the film that became emotionally involving was the animated back story of oren ishii  ironic that the cartoon section should hold more substance than the main film while i realise that we will discover much more in volume ii i still found it hard to keep with a film that was only interested in giving me visual stimulationspeaking of visual stimuli  the fight scenes are clever and impressive the total lack of cgi is refreshing and the wire work looks natural and never goes totally ott  my favourite scene is in the blacked out room in the house of blue leaves  a scene that lacks the gore but is visually uncluttered and stylish  the gore does get a bit tiresome and some of it was meant to be shocking but little of it is unless this is your first movie  one thing that bothered me in the cinema was some viewers feeling they had to laugh during the fight  as if tarantino can only do violence if it is darkly funny in some waythe list of homages etc come thick and fast  at times it works well sonny chibas comic relief chapter but at other points it is so heavy and self aware that it is almost a spoof of the genre rather than a part of it  the opening title cards before the film are quite clever but when tarantino gives up his own style in favour of aping others then it is a bit much likewise the rzas score is mixed in the same way  at times his music is perfect  keeping the mood without losing his own style  at others the music is almost a lift from other films and it feels like a spoofthe cast are good despite not having much to work with in terms of characterisation or dialogue  thurman is strong and holds the attention liu is impressive but her character is at her most interesting when in anime form  carradine manages to be larger than life despite us only seeing his hands  chiba is a nice comic touch at the start of his scene and chiaki kuriyama is cool despite herself being a walking reference  fox madsen and hannah have little to do but will hopefully have more in volume iioverall i did quite enjoy the film but i was left a little cold by a mix of lack of substance and total visual onslaught  it has clever moments and it never let my interest wane but i really would have liked a bit of heart to go along with the vast amount of guts and limbs it had  will i be there for volume ii  a fantastic last line from bill himself ensures that i will be,cruel
the strong empowered female characters the expertly executed fight scenes the beautiful contrast in colours throughout the film i never tire of this film even though i find tarantino as a person questionable at best,cruel
tarantino is a master blood dialogue plot acting cast directing cinematography music everything is phenomenal this movie left me speechless so fun and so good,cruel
if you said to me that i was going to die by the hand of some of the women of this movie i would die a happy man for this film is any martial art expert wet dream pretty girls with swords gory deaths and the dialogue made by quentin tarantino sign me inthe movies follows the bride as see goes on a vengeance quest to assassinate the people who try to killed her in her wedding day god an other mass killing in a wedding it makes you think if rr martin inspired tarantino or the slaughter in this flick the producers of the series in the rains of castamere who knows but it is fun to try to connect two amazing productions for it is confirmed by quentin him self that all of his movies are in the same universe so he is not a uninitiated to this ideathe dialogues as we all know by now are quick quotable and create tension by themselves alone every character is unique and you come in a few minutes know his story art temper and ideals what would you expect after innovative killings sharp dialogue and great cinematography the other strong point of tarantino is that he can flesh out characters in a matter of seconds there very few directors and writers who can do that so that flick deserve rightfully its cult status and more than a decade after it is in everyone list of amazing flicksif you havent seen as the man said himself  the beep you were doing the past years living under a rock,cruel
sometimes i wish that quentin tarantino could weave a bit more substance into his stylized violence festivals is a good example of a more general problem with his oeuvrethere are some really nice aesthetic moments in this movie but then there is a lot of extreme unpleasantness such as the disturbing revelation that the uma thurman character who has been comatose for four years was being serially used as a prostitute by one of the male nurses her pimp unbeknownst to her at the hospital very repulsive and gratuitously so tarantino seems to like to come up with sickening scenarios just to prove that he can i mean what role did the scene play in the larger storythats the problem of course the larger story is just a lot of violence carried out in revenge to other violence upon emerging from her coma the uma thurman character goes on a mission to avenge her dead family all of whom were killed at her weddingtarantino has an idiosyncratic but consistent view of violence which in a way is humanistic as odd as that might sound everyone who does horrible things to people has been the victim of horrible things done to him or her they feel fully justified in retaliating but in the end everyone becomes morally equivalent which is to say in a word repugnant,cruel
i tried 4 times to watch this movie because it was a tarantino film and because it got such good ratings on this website i like fight scenes and i dont mind a bit more than normal blood amount spewing everywhere but this movie was overkill in fact the new title should be overim down with the bride seeking revenge but tell me besides the new sword she got what gave her the ability to start taking out scores of gangsters every time i tried to watch i got stuck at the scene where shes fighting the japanese gang and wiping them out every time i get to that part i just have to stop it because it is just tooo ridiculous my reference for rating this movie are other martial arts movies and i love martial arts movies i dont mind over the top fighting or skills ala iron monkey or any martial arts movie ever made but i do mind it when the person has no business being able to do what they are doing,cruel
this movie is a stupid and boring sequence of  rubbish it made me annoyed and angry at its director it contains nothing more than a strange aesthetic presentation of violence it has no story at all it has no meaning at alltarantino probably has watched several ten thousand of movies in his life i guess that in absolutely every single shot every single picture is some kind of quotation from another movie kung fu spaghetti western gangster stuff japanese trash anime or whatever all that stuff which is boring and intolerablethis movie is not intended for audiences but just for himself its not personal its an tarantinoegomovie nothing morehe could make this movie realize his worst ego trip for the one and only reason that he has made enough money with pulp fiction otherwise this wouldnt have been possiblei cant tell how disappointed i am if you are a great tarantino fan do not even think of watching this dreadful nonsense,cruel
it is depressing to see looking at the ratings profile of the online voters how little people seem to appreciate well made films this movie appropriates every but of grindhouse martial arts spaghetti western and comics tropes that tarantino finds cool its cool for cools sake he seems to think the audience will sit around and get their jollies off placing which movie every cool moment comes fromharmless fun i dont see how its either and thats a pretty good take on his films in general those things that he finds cool were interesting because of the context in which they happened the story the actors the sets the direction all came together to create something that was special you cant just cut and paste it into something that has none of the original elements and think it works or that it isnt insulting to the original creators they worked long and hard to accomplish that and he thinks his cut and paste is homage its a huge freakin insultits depressing that so many obviously think as he hopes they will but whats with his ive opted out of understanding the laws of physics are people so mindless that they just dont care same criticism as above martial arts films became what they were because of people that worked long and hard at their art a trampoline and some pulleys works just as well for you how dead behind the eyes do you have to be to enjoy this he does that in every movie he makes a gunshot will send up a wall of liquor bottles forget that in a convenience store most of all of it would be 80 proof and that doesnt burn with a torch held to it let alone a single bullet is it that people are too stupid to know better does he know betterso i would submit that if you find it cool to be cool for cools sake as he is doing here that you should think seriously about the title of this review your cool icons wouldnt ever have existed in a world dominated by people that would enjoy this movie do you want more of that in the world or less if you breed there will certainly be less of itanother tarantino black mass for the brain damage and soccer addled,cruel
im sorry i started with such a tagline but thats what this movie is all aboutso the premise goes like this  the bride uma thurman is all bloodied up and lying on the ground at the altar of her wedding surrounded by armed assassins of a squad of which she herself was earlier a member of and who just wiped out anyone and everyone at the wedding they then shoot her in what appears to be a deathblow but then she instead slips into a coma and wakes up years later to avenge the execution of her husband baby  she was carrying during the massacre and everyone at her wedding then begins the journey of the bride  name not mentioned anywhere in the first movie  who sets out to take revengeuma thurman does a great job as a sexy expert assassin out on the loose she sparkles with her charisma and style that it makes her bloody revenge look beautiful and fashionable lucy liu as the wicked oren shii the head of tokyo underworld and the brides first revenge targets is stillfaced like a mannequin but that suits her role of a mindcontrolled assassinin a revengeflick like this the action sequences have to be flawless and yes they were there is also a flashback of one of the characters in anime which serves as a nice assortment in a 110min long medley of brutal massacres the action the stunts get better in every scene the japanese samurais defy gravity and jump around as if they are weightless you have to be a braveheart to watch the entire film without having a nauseating headache there is so much red in the movie that it puts spains la tomatina festival to shame every time a limb is lopped off and believe me it happens a lot there is blood just spurting out like a fountain and the killer is spraytanned in blood you have one scene where the massacre is so bloody that the entire action sequence is shown in black and white however in the japanese version this scene is in colourthis film is not without its goofs and flubs like any other quentin tarantino film but i didnt mind because its entertaining and fast paced there was not a single second in the film during which i wanted to keep my eyes off the screen it is a must watch for all the action junkies and more so for people like me who love films like resident evil underworld aeon flux et cetera etc and who love to watch the leading ladies wield guns and swords like they are barbie dolls,cruel
welli wasnt expecting much from this movie but i didnt think it would be that bad eitherits a highly overrated and hyped movie which is a complete waste of timethe problem with it is simply everything writing characters story sequence of events direction terrible and cast unconvincingit has a ridiculous story which was written by some very lazy writers and its really uninspired that recycles the whole revenge thing in movies these days not mentioning the flat and meaningless characters and the random sequence of events that doesent make any sense at alland besides its long and endless boring pointless and awfulin conclusion trash a garbage movie which is a lame excuse for an action movie,cruel
if this film had not been directed by tarantino but still would have been the same film it would have become a cpicture with a rating not above 50 what is this supposed to be anyway pseudointellectual pseudoaesthetic i dont know i dont see any beauty or intellectual challenge in this whatsoever it is an agony to watch a man inspecting a sword for two minutes which he was supposed to be looking at for a whole month before that and a soon as the viewer is about to fall asleep someones guts are spilled all over the place i cant imagine brutality that is more pointless and sickening people who take other peoples lives without feeling anything should not be glorified like this mr tarantino clearly has some serious issues if only he kept them to himself,cruel
title said it all bloody gore fest with no real purpose other than to separate the unsuspecting from there incomes although fantasy is what film is about for the most part this trash takes it beyond the pale one would have to have the imagination of a five year old  still believing in the boogy under the bed in order to even begin to find this one hundred and eleven minutes of boredom in the least bit interesting the only redeeming part of the experience is that i did not pay theater prices on top of wasting the time spent to view it if i had it would have been one of those few times i had returned to the box office in order to ask for my ticket price back as for the chance of this review containing a spoiler the movie does that in and of itself,cruel
people get used to unreal movie elements like broken glass that doesnt cut or a badly wounded hero who can still fight like a healthy man etc and they just ignore them to be able to enjoy the movie so do i but sometimes these unreal element get too many and too blatant to accept or just ignore them this movie is a fine example to that starting with the protagonist waking up from years long coma by a damn mosquito bite then she carries her sword around openly as if it was some harmless toy and nobody cares about it she can even bring it up on a plane and when it gets to a fight everyone stand against her with mle weapons mostly swords as if it would be in the middle ages and not the 21st century there isnt a single gun in the whole movie except for a toy shotgun which fired popcorn at the protagonist obviously not hurting her and these are just the most blatant bulls there are many more the movie fails morally too every single person in it are violent aholes the good guys are as bad or even worse as the bad guys actually by the standards of the protagonist slaughtering people for the smallest insult makes you good  as we see it by the introduction of the yakuza leaders personal bodyguard a 16 yo girl who is mature and good because she gutted a guy who wanted to get her laid and of course our heroine is really good by this standard she mutilated horribly or killed i dont remember 2 people right in the first minute after she regained consciousness not to be confused with conscience because she never regained that  assuming she had any to begin with then she murders a mother in front of her little daughter and in the end she chops off a few hundred limbs and has fun doing it of course the police is never after her maybe there is no police at all there violence has no consequence in this move  not even this huge amount of violence,cruel
this is seriously one of the worst movies i have seen in my relatively short lifetime it has an extremely weak plot and i felt that this movie was made purely for pointless violence tarintino is a awful director and this is one of his worst movies there were long sequences where there was no action and the characters only spoke in japanese without sub titles it made the plot hard to follow and boringit is full of unrealistic scenarios and after the first 10 minutes it seemed i was just watching the same thing over and over the awful acting doesnt help the already terrible plotonly a small minded idiot who cannot appreciate movies would enjoy this purely because it was only pointless violence that was extremely bloody overall tarintino is an extremely uncreative director who cannot think up a sophisticated plot an this movie gets a 110 on every level it is the worst movie i have seen,cruel
this is a typical tarantinowentsnuts movie overloaded with senseless violence and trying to be cool but unfortunately completely lacking the ability to make you care about anything and anyone in it besides tarantino should not go asian  they have enough senseless action movies on their own  the movie also completely lacks the funny dialogs i so enjoyed in pulp fiction and also the interesting story twists  its just linearwhile i do not have a problem with violence i request that a film makes me care at least about the main character and even better  about the storythe story here is the typical go get revenge story all too familiar from loads of action flix only that it desperately wants to be cool and becomes laughable in the processi have seen way better matrial arts action and the acting is disappointing too in fact here the action is in part completely overdone and all the time wannabecool  it hurtsi also would like to question the casting of uma thurman for this  hated her in this role  she should have stayed in the coffin was this part one or 2 dont care in fact as for carradine  well he is used to be in cheesy movies at leastthe characters are all as flat as a postage stamp fits to the story somehow couldnt they just all be gunned down by rambo we could than live happy and be spared the equally bad second partso for me this movie is tarantinos worst movie as for now as well as one of the worst movies in general  do not watch it,cruel
why is this movie considered a masterpiece only thing i can find it to be is a piece of st when people tell why they love this movie its because they like the style of it and because quentin tarantino made it i am amazed how dumb people really are uma thurman is a horrible actress and in her leading role she is in a coma for several years and then wakes up to kick some baddies and is completely invincible the ironic thing is the fight scenes are terrible the movements are so stock and regular for a martial arts movie  and the blood looks silly i cant take this movie seriousand it encourage vengeance  what the heck is that supposed to be a good thing and do you know what else she gets a katana in this movie only to right then why the heck does she not use it in the second movie and why cant we get to know the name of the bride its not like the audience gives a st instead they have a beep sound every freakin time they say her name man thats not annoying huhgive me one one single good reason why this movie could be considered even anything above average,cruel
i loved pulp fiction enjoyed reservoir dogs and had heard good things about so was expecting something outstanding it turned into the biggest disappointment of any movie that i have ever seen several times in the last hour i thought that tarantino could not possibly let things get any worse and each time i was wrongthis movie couldnt decide what it wanted to be there were some serious parts some facetious ones and some fantasy ones which just did not work any one style would have but three did not it was at times samurai gangster and drama movie and again any one of the three would have been fine  but only onethe constant change of styles was bad enough but even many individual scenes were poorly done independently of anything else in combination they meant that the movie which actually started out moderately well deteriorated into a series of scenes that worked badly on their own and terribly in combinationi know that everyone loves this film i know that both critics and the public rate it highly i know that im analysing it in a lot of depth rather than just sitting back and enjoying it as everyone else does but how anyone can relax sit back and enjoy it with so much going wrong i will never know,cruel
everyone is anxious to underline how clever tarantino is at paying homage to a broad range of cinematic influences whilst im sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who dont neither film has anything else to redeem it the dialogue is woeful throughout retaining all the style but none of the substance of pulp fiction or reservoir dogs the performances are twodimensional and completely uninvolving although much of the blame for that must fall on tarantino for having penned such feeble characters because you dont care about anyone on screen the violence appears aimless and gratuitous but the worst thing about these films is that the tarantino badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws where any other director would be completely torn to pieces those of us who believe that filmmaking should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films the tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype whatever the fans say style can never survive without substance thankfully we can be sure that this meaningless rubbish will disappear into the mists of time and the sooner the better,cruel
when someone once commented that this movie is a masterpiece i had to laugh has no intelligence or real story to it but is only a stream of scenes of mindless murders masterpiece for the deaf dumb and blind perhaps calling tarantino movies masterpieces is like calling a cheap van gogh imitation at the swap meet a masterpiece hollywood is infamous for copying everything foreign and trying to recycle it into an english version adapted for the american audiencethis is exactly what tarantino does with his incessant plagiarism is just a copy and paste of an oriental movie cant remember the name this director loves all the bizarre bmovies from abroad to me duplication simply defines a complete lack of talent a lazy attempt to play director and indeed i have never been impressed with anything that comes out of tarantinoquentins work is mindless and unintelligent in my view ive often wondered what kind of person is attracted to materials like this obviously someone who enjoys to only feed the public with incessant destruction and murder and who for some reason finds this subject appealing im sure well have a few hundred misaligned kids in the next generation coming from tarantinos work,cruel
lame i could only watch about 20 minutes of this give or take if i had paid to see it in a theater id have walked outsure its got snappy dialogso what the whole deadly viper assassination squad thing is just so contrived it sounds like its from a comic book a bad comic bookwhere is a character one can identify with certainly not the one played by uma thurmanwho kills a childs mother in front of her then sort of apologetically says she had it coming this film has no redeeming social value whatsoever i cant believe anybody would finance this drivel,cruel
uma thurman is clint eastwood in drag in this blood drenched comic book of a movie about revenge that is as stale as the the 30 year old low budget chop socky garbage it emulateson her wedding day the pregnant bride thurman has her reception ruined when her old employer bill ceo of an assassination bureau has his squad of flunkies shoot up the festivities all present are killed with the exception of the bride who remains in a coma for a few years when sleeping beauty eventually arises all hell breaks loose determined to exact revenge on former coworkers in warrior fashion she embarks on a bloody path from the states to japanmovie boy wonder of the last decade quentin tarantino is a prime example of how far american cinema has fallen since its late seventies collapse critics have sung his praises far and wide as a new voice with a fresh approach having achieved iconic pop culture and auteur status kills full title is quentin tarantinos 4th film 1 welles and ford never got that type of billing and hitchcock didnt earn it until his fiftieth film not qt hes a phenom i however must respectfully disagreebill is very colorful and surreal most of the time which dilutes its effect kills the realism and turns the characters into solemn cartoon characters tarantinos dialogue is his typical profanity laced paragraphs that nuanced slightly could be interchanged with all his other profanity laced scripts of threat and bravado his visuals go from tedious posing to nostalgic kung fu chaos seasoned in buckets of blood they have the sophistication of a disturbed 9 year old who has troubles staying within the lines of his coloring book in addition to thurmans eastwood sex change he evokes the style and pacing of the lumbering work of sergio leone from start to finish as a comic book 1 would be a page turner the only thing it turns as a film in the adolescent hands of tarantino is ones stomach,cruel
this film starts well but rapidly deteriorates into boring rubbish negligible plot negligible dialogue if you require nothing more from a film than seeing fountains of blood from severed limbs then this is the film for you as far as im concerned its an hour and forty minutes ill never get back we had every gimmick thrown at us cartoon sequences black and white sequences slow motion sequences but nothing could make this film interesting tarantino is either completely mad or more likely from the high rating this film has scored here is a very good judge of the low intellect of his audience one of the worst films ive ever seen its hard to believe that the same person could have made something as brilliant as pulp fiction,cruel
my sister loved so much this movie when she went to the theater to watch it that i was intrigued to the bones some time after i had to rent it because i had a thorn in my sidewhat an awful and hollow movie i found goshi really do not understand when i see people saying this movie was brilliant or artistic where is the art part of this stupid garbage i had watched pulp fiction and i thought it was entertaining i really enjoyed my time watching pulp fiction so i thought was going to be good specially after all the hype but i realized that quentin tarantino is that kind of director who makes a good film and say well now i can make any garbage that people will think is brilliant because my name is on iti tried to give it a second chance watching the sequel but it was more of the same actually it is not a sequel tarantino just split the film in 2 because it would have been extremely longsorry for the people who likes this movie but to me it sucked it has no plot at all it is just a woman who came from a 5 years period coma miraculously and wants to take revenge and kill every former partner of her mafia brotherhood all you can see in this movie is blood blood and blood violence brutality even in front of little children and some ridiculous scenes also there is about 15 min of anime for no reason that i watched unwillingly i love anime but if i rent a movie with real actors i want to see real actors not stupid cartoons and the anime scene is just the 1000timesseen scene of you are a kid hidden under the bed scared to death while your parents are being killed in the same roomwhen i told my sister this movie sucked she asked me but had you read about tarantino come on a movie is something you just watch you must not need to read about the director or the movie or anything the movie must be enjoyable itself my sister also said with the martial art scenes tarantino wanted to tribute bruce lee because he loves him sorry tarantino but you did not make any bruce lee tribute at all shame on youthe only thing i liked was the music the music is very good but i would rather play the music cd than watch this garbage again,cruel
while watching this movie i was really tempted to stop it and return the dvd you see my exwife pushed it into my hands telling me how great that movie was i didnt want to watch it because i knew it was very violent well i should have stuck to my original decisionviolence is presented as an art form in this movie as if seeing fountains of blood spurting out of peoples bodies was a beautiful sight sigh it seems to me that we are back to the roman times with people cheering as the martyrs were being fed to the lionsso what of the cinematographic skills of tarantino well yes i too detected some reuse of masters techniques i heard the spaghetti western music and saw its very very closeup shots i got the de palmas split screen and the carrie scene all covered with blood even the big fight scene had been done before in one of the zatoichis movies and there were a few others too but really whats the point of going on and on on one hand we have a pretty simple plot i am not going to go over that here others have done it very well and on the other a director with a vision made up of the great masters ideas ok tarantino does know how to direct a movie and some of his use of the great masters influence is acceptable but here i thought it was just too much combined with an overly simple story and an excessive level of violence his overuse of others grand ideas becomes just that a succession of tricks as far as i am concerned violence and cinematographic tricks are just no substitute for a good story no matter how many of them you mix into the pot,cruel
this movie is a sort of adolescent wet dream ninja woman who acts like a cool man and looks good in a tight suit kills people with a samurai swordthis movie has pitifully little dialogue and it doesnt have that usual tarantino snap what had a delicious pulpy quality in earlier offerings now comes off as shallowi suppose we should praise qt for making something a little different to his usual stuff but frankly this movie is coma inducing and its not really that far out from his previous work the chapters between the fight scenes seem like a glass of warm flat beer and qt has served up some crisp refreshing ale before so its even more disappointing after the millionth decapitation mutilation spray of blood etc the gore is not shocking its so cartoony that you cant really feel anything you just think this movie doesnt hold together and its boringill give a few points for the odd spectacular fight scene shot but frankly its not a visceral experience its not clever and i left my teens behind six years agoa cheap kung fu movie with expensive production values and that ruins whatever magic those types of movies have oh and the anime stuff in the middle just feels out of place and forced,cruel
quentin tarantino has not done himself any favors with the presentation of some have lauded this film as an example of tarantinos established expertise i felt that exactly the opposite was truewhile pulp fiction still has the ability to elicit feelings of appreciation for its fresh new approaches after many viewings left me with the impression that i had already seen more of it than i would have liked tothere are some plot holes that are weakly patched and some scenes that were apparently intended to be eyepopping bloodbaths of combat with samurai swords there is even a japanese anime portion inserted unexpectedly into the movie which is interesting in its own right but seems to draw the viewer out of the film rather than more deeply into its plotat one point possibly as an apology for the blatant almost funny in its exaggeration bloodbath tarantino switches from color to a black and white format while the switch to bw as well as the change to anime might be considered examples of tarantinos brilliant renegade moviemaking style here they come off as weak props manipulating the viewers commitment in an effort to keep us watching a little longeri did stay with the film to the end i also followed it with a viewing of 2 my impression did not change much over the course of the entire viewingis an attempt to make a clint eastwood spaghetti western with the fragilelooking uma thurman as the macho protagonist uma does look striking in her leathers and carries off the performance with style but she is not convincing as a fighter no matter how strong and sharp her steel blade might be the believability factor is stretched so thin at one point uma takes on a large group of trained fighters all at once and of course whips them like so many playthings they spew a lot of blood and die spectacularly so whati will probably enjoy pulp fiction many more times i wont be watching any more ,cruel
oh joy someone gave quentin tarantino another chance when will they learn in this outing tarantino decides to revisit the 1970s spy thrillerblaxploitation flick with uma thurman playing the role of shaft the only advantage he has over the original era seems to be a better quality of film stockplenty of reviews praise the originality of this movie the people writing those reviews are nitwits this is arguably the most derivative piece of hackwork ive ever seen its every pace its every camera angle is lifted from previous eras and other genres theres no originality in pastiche and if tarantino or other pseudointellectuals want to dignify this conjob with the name of homage it doesnt change the facts theres a reason that schlockfests like this went out in the 1980s  audiences outgrew them well apparently a new crop of teenage boys need the lesson taught again too badthe entire plot is predicated on a revenge for a crime we get no background on the victims and the perpetrators are essentially nameless free of anything more than comicbook level characterizations everyone in the movie is a grotesque parody leaving the discerning audience member who can see past the gallons of fake blood to hunt in vain for anyone worth rooting forthis is strictly for those prepubescents who think its kewl for women to dress up in bondage outfits and have swordfights anyone with more maturity than that should steer clear,cruel
why is everyone ecstatic about this b karategore movie i have tried to watch it several times and i have never been able to watch more than 20 minutes of it each time no dialogs a cigarette thin plot gratuitous b violence pompous artsy fartsy camera angles completely meaningless well they actually serve a purpose for the director who keeps reminding the audience look guys where i put the camera im a genius see admire me as a matter of fact if it wasnt for the weird camera angles this would be a pretty plain bad film instead of a pompous bad film filming dialog from the top of a tree or from underneath the soles of the actors shoes is nothing to get excited about this is not what cinema is about this is advertising making this is a film for brainwashed tv addicts who confuse ad making and film making a very depressing film experience i refuse to endorse just because so many ignorants got thrilled by it just because they have never seen anything worthy before another pathetic miramax contribution to the history of cinema the weinstein brothers are the kings of marketing thank god history wont remember the weinstein brothers,cruel
this movie has moments of artistic merit such as the japanese garden scene during snowfall it is also commendable in its attempt to synthesize several different genres into one picture this effort though for the most part fails the different genres dont really mesh together seamlessly into one fabric but seem tacked together and disjointedwhat really torpedoes this picture is its excessive violence the violence is so repetitive it becomes mind numbing at other times it is so graphic it is repugnant the violence itself adds little to the story development and has little artistic merit however if you are hardened to this sort of thing and enjoy it then this picture is for you,cruel
okay first off i love quentin tarantino one mention of the man and i light up like a christmas treebut i loathed this movie maybe its because i grew up on roughly the same movies as quentin knew what to expect when he was busy namedropping influences and got disappointed when the movie didnt deliver maybe its because yuen woo pings choreography here was way below par for the great man that he isi dont knowhowever my best bet is that my final decision that 1 was godawful happened after that arm came off and ridiculous comicbook blood flew forth from the wound ive seen my fair share of limb severances and that was the weakest it was all i could do not to roll off the sofa in fits of derisive laughter somewhere along the line somebody forgot to mention how completely unconvincing is i can suspend my disbelief in halloween resurrection and that movie was pretty creaky too but it was a hell of a lot more fun than so its not for lack of effort or even lack of style that fails its just the fact that the moment anyone dies it happens in such a stupid cartoon fashion that youre jolted all the way back to your sofa and you realise you need the toilet youve got to be at work the next morning and youve been watching this damn thing for an hour and a half for a movie in which being violent seems to be the entire pointgod knows theres damn little substance anywhere else in this first two hour chunk youd think they could have got it righttake the violence out which anyone who likes violent movies may as well as they will have seen five times this movie a gazillion times before and you realise a uma thurmans character is intentionally glacial and wooden which is all well and good but makes her impossible to really root for b there is nighon no script or dialogue to speak of in this first part and c most sections dont synch well with each other giving the movie a look at this now look at that feel that just hacked me offsoid like to see part 2 just to find out how it all plays out but first ive got to go and get the ajax and a pan scourer to wash the foul taste of this part out of my mouth i state again tarantino is an amazing director but everyone makes mistakes this is his first,cruel
volume one 2003 was the first part of a three and a half hour film instead of putting out a three and a half hour grind house picture the directed split it in half and got two movies out of the production quentin tarentino knew better than to try and direct the action scenes himself so he hired yuen wooping to direct the action when you combine the bride wore black from bombay to nagoya and lady snow blood you get one of the most interesting films of 2003the movie is about a woman simply known as the bride uma thurman she was a member of an elite team of assassins known as the divas lucy liu michael madsen daryl hannah vivica a fox all of its members had code names of poisonous snakes well she wanted to leave but it aint so easy to leave the business after being in a coma for nearly five years the bride plots her revenge to get the rest of the vipers and their ring leader bill david carradine the road to revenge is filled with a lot of obstacles can the bride achieve her goals and eliminate the divas or will they be able to stop her dead in her tracksi didnt like the american release but i saw the movie again on a japanese import dvd and i was quite impressed by the uncut version if i were to review the american theatrical version i wouldnt have been too kind followed by a very disappointing sequelhighly recommended japanese version,cruel
i guess you can leave it up to quentin tarantino and the good people at mirimax to make a franchise out of one movie unlike films such as the lord of the rings and the matrix the cutting in half of was an after thought tarantino believed that people wouldnt be able to handle a 3andahalf hour film which is ridiculous because bringing up lord of the rings again i know that many people went to see screenings of all 3 lotr films backtoback now thats one long movie go ahead and do the math and that just shows how devoted fans can be and now tarantino has ripped off his loyal fans charging two separate prices for one film and dont get me started with the whole bare bones dvds with the intent of releasing special editions in the future multiple bites of the apple issue just shamelessbut you have to suck it up its a pain yes but underneath it all we do have a quality movie here after waiting more than half a decade since jackie brown quentin tarantino has come back to films with a vengeance this time around he borrows from and references so many movies that its nearly impossible to keep track of them all for me at least since im not exactly a huge fan of the martial arts genre but thats okay because tarantino interprets it all in a way that is pretty clever and enjoyable in a way its the merging of american and japanese styles of filmmaking theres martial arts and anime but theres also some jive talk so ya know its a good mix and i have to say that it undoubtedly features one of the best action sequences of the last decadethe cast or human props if you prefer is well thought out and of good variety uma thurman the star is obviously the standout shes a little bit scary and a little bit sexy she just kicks butt she does absolutely everything necessary in what she calls her role of a lifetime and surely needs to be regarded from now on as one of the best female action characters in cinemait sucks having to pay twice the amount of money for one movie but as far as this particular half goes it is really enjoyable theres no doubt in my mind that vol2 is the superior half but this is a fun film loaded with action gore and all the things you could ever want from a quentin tarantino filmmy rating 8510,cruel
its not by chance that the credits give this the honor of being the 4th tarantino film 4 being the number associated in some parts of asia with death but its not the abundance of gory executions the ominous number should be referred to but rather the final demise of any creativity that this bold icon of shoddy plagiarism representsis the ultimate exploitation movie and reflects all too well the complete lack of ideas of this era of hollywood globalization that which until now we thought was best portrayed by the matrix trilogy takes the omnivorous homogenizing machine one step further the tribute into cut and paste land at its worst the movie is a repetitive cartoonat its best this is a clever pastiche of spectacular scenes all of which give the viewer an uncomfortable feeling of dj vu but indeed thats what many film viewers like to pay for anyway as the tell all movie trailers of late seem to indicate no surprises lavish special effects the problem is that tarantino never gets even close to the spontaneity of the many lowbudget flicks he tries to imitate sure its possible that the protectionist us movie and cartoon market has saved many viewers from experiencing the original versions of quentins tributes and the product is definitely sleek and polished but who wouldnt have achieve such shine with the power of the then almighty dollar like stone in natural born killers tarantino switches back and forth between real and cartoon reality unlike stones stylish mtv era animation here we have only apparently more appropriate animestyle gorefests the graphic style is reminiscent of early seventies anime but the action is all okuto no ken the use of sharp overexposed black and white for the grisliest scenes is excellent but wait where did i see thatthe japanese scenes are pathetic at best they really look like the product of a fanboy who ohsodesperately tries to recreate the texture of his wet dreams failing miserably at giving it a life of its own the icon for this effort is lucy lius casting as oishii cottonmouth as clumsy on the set as she is desperately trying to utter japanese that doesnt sound completely inadequate to any minimally proficient viewer here the director loses a great opportunity to dub the lessthancapable actress with a japanese voice actor maybe with intentionally poor lipsync now that would have been clever and would have also spared my ears the best of worst performance is however the table speech at the yakuza conference i suspect the only research done for was adding black rain to the moviestocopy pile thankfully liu delivers the speech in english too bad she is lousy at that and in any case we heard that stuff from honey bunny in a better movie ironically tarantino is at his best when staying away from asianthemed schlock and indulging instead in sharply exposing the ugly american the texas scenes are memorable as the ugliness of the hospital comatose rape word unfortunately even thats where self indulgence and self referencing abound the pussy wagon reminds nostalgic viewers of zeds chopper and the hospital ward his dungeon unfortunately in show business you can pull that kind of trick once the second time sorry you are repeating yourself albeit stylishly i resisted watching this embarrassing excuse for movie until both dvd editions where in the cheap movie rack now i wish i waited a little longer,cruel
vol 1 in the imdbs top 100 right now it holds position n56 is the biggest joke of the year the only tarantino film that should be allowed into the top 100 is vol 2 in my opinion the first time tarantino did more than steal from other movies the line between reference homage and plagiarism is pretty thin indeed when i first saw 1 i thought it was a good film with lots of references to quentins favourite movies the first tarantino film that i could enjoy yet i was more hopeful for the second installmentat the time i was surprised as to how many goofs id spotted in the film i knew some were deliberately in there but some were indeed mistakes at the time i was able to enjoy lots of referencesall that changed last week when i watched lady snowblood in my bold and arrogant opinion tarantino has taken just too much out of this film to see it as a reference some examples fight in the snow dividing the film in chapters the kill list the cartoon images in lady snowblood anime in the extreme education both the lady and the bride had to suffer and while were comparing after seeing lady snowblood beatrixs education looked like kindergarten the big fight in an establishment okay the opponents werent masked but the next scene was set at a masked ball im sure i left out a few as i was watching lady snowblood my respect for 1 dropped by the minute there are way too many comparable scenes for it to be a homage the nicest i can be is say its a remake oh and i know that lady and bill arent the only revenge films out there but isnt it a coincidence that so many references are out therewhich brings us to meiko kaji the actress who starred as lady snowblood and female convict scorpion of which the song urami bushi can be enjoyed on bills soundtrack it would be unfair to compare lady snowblood to the bride but life isnt fair so here we go while uma thurman does her best a meiko kaji she aint kaji had it in her to combine the looks of venus and medusa which is pretty rare by contrast uma thurmans character resembles the lady as much as umas version resembled the real emma peelas i mentioned before i liked vol 2 better i know that the dialogues are pretty weak at times a real problem for tarantino by the way but its the first time i could see this director do more than make references to films he liked 2 is made as an italian western ennio morricone has vowed to kill anyone wholl still call these films spaghetti westerns and you sort of feel this as you watch the film the other tarantinos felt like juxtapositions of references but in 2 theres a story a coathanger that guides you through the film if now tarantino learns how to write interesting dialogues he actually might be able to make an excellent film as long as he learns that copying references only works as long as people havent seen the real dealnow it just feels like youve watched psycho the gus van sant version,cruel
vol 1 is like all tarantinos flicks deliberate use of the word flix selfconsciously postmodern and referentialreverential he knows his trade and those who miss the inherent humour in this film miss the point entirely it seems on the surface an uneasy marriage  between classical greek tragedy and japanese kabuki  perhaps even noh  theatre and theres the rub the violence is stylised as usual with this directors genre to the extent that it becomes a bloody ballet when uma thurman drags her characters body into the pussy wagon her feet become the centre of attention  a dancers fixation  and at this point i have to say they are ugly feet regardless they are a dancers feet at once welltravelled and wellusedabused this particular scene also indicates the strength of character which will carry the protagonist through the rest of the dance and dance it is revenge places thurmans character squarely into the role of nemesis this nameless virago is however compassionate toward the innocent  telling the child of someone she has just killed that eventually she will understand and if necessary come after the killer  is in a twisted sense a very moral stance in a reference to revenger tragedies only the bad are slaughtered in the extended fight sequence they are even masked a reference to nonentities extras in prior extravaganzas they dont matter and here i feel is a major point being made by tarantino faceless minions deserve an anonymous death those who kill to order deserve to die without acknowledgment however this film like other tarantino tributes to the aforementioned greek and japanese theatres should be enjoyed after all the jetting blood is very monty python and the holy grailish but even tarantino draws the line at a hopping torso threatening violence hmmm,cruel
vol 1 quentin tarantinos fourth film tells the story of a female assassin known only as the bride uma thurman who is attacked on her wedding day  she survives the attack but lives in a coma for the next four years at which point she wakes up and begins her plot for revengethe film demonstrates a total lack of originality  it both parodies and plays homage to old samurai movies yakuza japanese anime chopsocky kung fu flicks blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns  the references are numerous and begin with the opening credit sequence a tribute to the shaw brothers martialarts films of the 1970s  the film spends so much time resembling these other genres that it fails to create its own identitytarantino as he did with pulp fiction plays around with the order of the narrative giving it a nonlinear form  unlike in pulp fiction however the reordering of events does little for the film  it plays like a gimmick it is there simply as his signature mark  it contributes nothing to the films artistrythe end of the movie is revealed very early on making the ensuing battle scenes which are incredibly gory and drag on endlessly rather pointless nothing is saved for the climax  the narrative linear or not must work toward the uncovering of some level of meaning or understanding about the films core themes  this film doesnt have any themes  is one big asskissing job by quentin tarantino to the film genres that have entertained him for so longtarantino fans will be disappointed as the film lacks the tarantinoesque dialogue they have come to enjoy  the plot is thin and what backstory we are given pertains to all characters except the main character played by uma thurman  the audience therefore cannot empathize with her and join her in battle  the film will catch the attention of guts and gore fans though one scene was filmed in black and white to tone down the severity of the gore enabling the film to retain an r ratingif you enjoy action and only action then this film is for you  substance seekers stay away  in the words of tarantino himself weve all seen this beforeyou know the story goin inits easy to follow,cruel
a juggernaut of technical wizardry this quentin tarantino film product is winking and nodding but not especially human a diehard of the neowestern where japanese samurai flicks meet the newfangled old west and tv action thrillers tarantino is the master of quick canny scenes of carnage it gets awfully bloody but not in the nc17 way no tarantino is much too cute and his imitativeness isnt exploitative or schlocky as much as he might like it to be he gives showy roles to many fine actors and uma thurman seems to inspire him to new heights but he also gets easily sidetracked and becomes selfenamored of scenes that dont play plod along or get too cheeky as with the opening bit featuring vivaca a fox which is good but not quite as solid as the rest of the film vol 2 is more storyheavy and gives the actors better room to emote but also features lots of outlandishness sometimes just for the sake of a cheap quick laugh the trickery comic mayhem wild ambushes and female asskicking dont amount to much in retrospect both volumes include some lovely moments successfully lowball comedy and they refuse to let up but do they honestly turn the audience on i felt exhausted instead of keyedup vol 1 12 from   vol 2  from ,cruel
is just another piece of overhyped fanfare with no real merits like many of qts other products there is a shockvalue installed through violence which does nothing but make the film gratuitously brutal  if you remove all graphic scenes from kb you are left with a sadly inept script bad acting and a funky if not cacophonous soundtrack sound like reservoir dogs   luckily for us qt knows americans can remember violence much longer than great writing so he can reap his rewards  im not even going to compare this film to the thousands of asian kungfu knockoffs  everyone knows a hollywoodproduced movie will succeed if its the first time an american audience discovers it the matrix jackie chan flicks etc  none of which are consdiered novel by hk cinema standardswhy cant qt make a picture with the qualities of other acclaimed directors like kubrick whether its visual 2001 dialoguedriven paths of glory or both a clockwork orange  leave the violence behind and jump on a more creditable bandwagon,cruel
i enjoyed reservoir dogs and pulp fiction so i thought tarantinos latest flick would be something that i could enjoy on a sunday night maybe the theater i saw the movie at had something to do with my negative reaction to it the theater was full of faux hip movie goers who laughed at every cross film reference blood spewing limb severing and any lines that even bordered on being witty this was supposed to be a homage of sorts to tarantino flicks i guess an amalgamation of b movies can be called a homage i call it lazy and uninspiring  theres the battle of blue leaves which is reminiscent of the 100 agent smiths in the matrix reloaded they are all wearing masks like bruce lee in the green hornet now why anyone is supposed to think a reference to the green hornet is brilliant or even a sly reference is beyond me donning bruce lees game of death suit may have been inspired by nostalgia but beyond that it doesnt add anything to the movie plus the action scenes in the movie are old hat ive seen these moves before in the matrix blade crouching tigert and even charlies angels uma flying through the air to land on a balcony seen that in cthd uma utterint witticisms while kung fuing multiple attackers seen that in charlies angels uma wielding a sword in blurring movements seen that in blade 2 animation blended with human portrayals of violence ive already saw that in a movie called natural born killers the fight between uma an lucy liu is not exactly groundbreaking either two people fighting in the snow how does this become one of the great scenes in cinema history i left the theater feeling like i had wasted my money  i didnt share the gushing emotions of the would be hipsters that left the theater gushing about how cool and mind blowing this flick was  the next time its decided that audiences are expected to hail a below average flick as brilliantsomeone be sure and let me in on it because its obvious that i missed the memo on this one,cruel
zero fantasy zero humor zero compared to pulp fiction full of aggressivity and revenge the sound and visual effects would be quite ok if there were anything behind,cruel
the fights are truly excellent if you happen to dig nearrealistic ultraviolent gorepacked screen fighting with some tasteful stylistic effects as are the parts directly preceding the fights and the whole beginning of the movie all in all about 2025 minutesthe rest of the 111 minutes consists of some lousy humor and a lot of dragging scenes as a result of awesomely bad scripting naturally iced with tarantinos trademarks chapters and nonlinear timeline this time actually adding very little to the film besides the nice beginning animation episode is a very nice touch but terribly realized unimaginatively clichd  ugly artmost of the casting is quite satisfactory with few excellent choices and a highly average lead although uma thurman handles the action parts very well she just lacks the edge and presence to be anywhere near believable in her ample bravado thus underlining the bmovie feeling of this film in an unfavorable way  a truly charismatic lead might have been able to make the purposefully corny lines both hilarious and impressive but her efforts fall flatif you want to see ultraviolent fighting and enough blood to engulf tokyo watch shogun assassin or any other movie tarantino tastefully has taken his inspiration from the plentiful mediocre and plain bad aspects of this film easily counter and knock out the worthy fighting moments although you might want to check them out on some medium that allows you to skip right to the beef,cruel
if you love anything by tarantino youll probably like this if you disliked jackie brown youll be disappointed by this too when the qt is good hes brilliant but hes far from good in unlike pulp fiction the violence here is mostly gratuitous unlike the artful use of cliches in reservoir dogs the cliches here are just cliches as in jackie brown the acting is horribly inconsistent uma thurman is great trying to get up out of her hospital bed and flirting with a sushi chef but she falls down playing the heavythere are a number of excellent scenes black mamba battling a cast of thousands a handicapped black mamba versus a nightmare of a hospital guard black mamba mano a mano against copperheadbut theres the rub the battles are fun captivating and sometimes as artistic as anything in hidden dragon or jackie chans best but there isnt really anything to sustain the tension between scenesbill is just a cliched bad guy shown only in belowtheneck profiles rubbing his scabbard and qt fails to draw the other gang members with any more detail theres a long narrative scene about oren ishiis lucy lius rise to powerbut its just a narrative as dull and dry as listening to someone read from the congressional record and with as little to do with the rest of the film tooand thats the next problem there are five or ten different directorial styles in the film and theres nothing tying them together it plays like a series of movie shorts on the same topic violence in gangstersamurai films narrated by the same person im convinced the only reason the oren scene remains in the movie was that qt wanted to try his hand at anime it doesnt appear to have its own place in the movielike wagners operas has some great moments and lousy halfhours unlike wagner im not inclined to return after the intermission to see vol 2,cruel
no plotno story at all to speak ofjust nonstop cartoon violence  the blood spurting from severed limbs ad infinitum reminded me of monty pythons black knight in the holy grail  i found this movie to be a monumental waste of time and boring as hell  leave your brain at the door far too many talented people were involved in this for the end result to be so pointless,cruel
i was entertained by tarantinos latest although disappointed in the lack of plot the action was well done and the picture is definitely  original in more ways than onethe movie is mostly a comic book like jackie chanonly uma movie portrayed in pulpfiction like style there are many good fighting scenes but for me this doesnt do enoughoverall i was entertained but disappointed,cruel
im having a really hard time understanding why this film ever saw the light of dayi mean its so terrible in every possible way there is no story the acting is terrible the filming is a jock and the characters are so fcking pathetic and lame tarantino really needs to shape up after this train wreck start working with real actors i mean start working with actors like lucy liu the film was crap before it even started getting madethe funny thing is that there is only one film worse then this and thats killbill vol 2dont waste your time one this crap 110,cruel
i like tarantinos movies but this movie is very very very boring everybody playing superman characters my rating is only 1 for great cartoon animation  some action im sory tarantino your last movie is not good,cruel
tarantino a master of indulgent egoism essentially creates a wet dream of a pulp samurai tale  gory  yes fine to a point  no not really tarantino lacks any real story girl wakes from coma girl wreaks revenge pretty straightforward stuff and tries to make up for it by making his film look as cool as it can  the result  a film that reeks of selfawareness and literally bores one comatose  dont waste your time,cruel
i used to be a qt fan until i saw this movie  it was stylish in parts but a total insult to ones intelligence  whith severed limbs gushing blood like fountains this was one of the most ridiculous films i have ever seeni am surprised that someone actually funded this film,cruel
i find it interesting that so many people on this message board seem to think this is a good film the film was obviously made to provide a vehicle for tarantino to make a mockery of gore and violence  he does that well and its his trademark  thats one thing  why people would become obsessed with this lopping of bodies and spraying of blood should cause us to be concerned  are we a sick and demented society,cruel
this is a very very bad film there is a one thread plot revenge no character development in fact no real characters to speak of at all uma thurman for some reason looks like a man in drag for most of the film which does not make the film any more watchable michael madsen is in the film for about 30 seconds minute maximum which is a pity as he is a great actor instead we have ten minutes of irrelevant animation at least 30 minutes where everybody is speaking japanese and during a fight scene it goes black and white for about five minutes you would think that tarantino was just out of film school to be trying all these amateurish tricks the editor who cut together the online trailer is a genius because he made it look like a good film when it is far from it the music incidentally is also the worst i have ever heard on any film and was probably the only thing preventing me from falling asleep the title character bill i only remember seeing his hands  was this to add suspense all the funny tarantino dialogue is gone the style is gone only the geek is left i will not be going to see volume 2  or any future offerings from tarantino avoid,cruel
first off let me say this  i am a quentin tarantino fan  my dvd collection includes everything he has written or directed  it will not contain i went into this film expecting to love it  i came out revulsed and disgusted  where qt has always used violence and mayhem to make statements about people and culture here he has made a film about violence for the sake of violence  i have a pretty strong stomach but the sight of a small childs mother being brutally murdered before her eyes was too much for me especially when the murderer is the character we are supposed to be rooting for  the childs reaction was played for grins not for pathos  shortly thereafter another childs parents are brutally murdered in such close proximity that the child is doused with their blood  this child seeks revenge which leads to the single most offensive line i have heard spoken in a film  fortunately for her bad guy was a pedophileunfortunately for us tarantino has lost his way,cruel
fx man really stole my thunder  this is a really bad movie  as i am writing this this has done 22 million for the weekend which is a nightmare for miramax  all the tarantino fans which i was once one have now clocked inand clocked out  the next weekend box office will disappear opinions about the worth of this film are of course subjective  the fact that miramax is going to have their heads handed to them isnt  this movie is now dead  no legs no rental and i doubt little overseas,cruel
tarantino is the most overrated director of all timeif he respected martial arts movies and actors why did he cast carradine who stole kung fu from bruce leethe only person who really digs tarantino films is tarantino himselfthe fact that theres a bigger deal about his efforts on sin citythan frank miller himself goes to show that people dig name brands rather than actual talentso tarantino watched a few films at his old jobbig dealat least miller creates or expands on previous creations to create new perspectives on old characters but always with a sense of originalityi know this is redundant as an argument comic book vs filmbut give credit where its due tarantino got the gig for marquee value and being rodriguezs matetarantino is best left to readers of style mags who talk and act clever and are like ssooo ironic but wouldnt touch a real martial arts film if you paid themhe could be a great actor thoughright,cruel
just because tarantino has good taste in music and some flashy scenes he isnt great hes an ugly geek he is always overrated i didnt like pulp fiction either so he steals music from old tv shows and always music that has been around before except for the jazzy new theme someone cooked up tarantino is a foul mouthed pig in my opinion and i know people are gonna get mad about this but who cares it is violent and what is so great about someone who slices off limbs and heads it is over the top in my opinion out of line and off the hook uma thurman must be hard up for money to make this mess of a movie sorry action fans this one leaves me sick to my stomach,cruel
might contain spoilersfirst thing before watching this movieplease make sure that the realism switch in your brains is turned off otherwise it could be tad hard to fully enjoy this visually very stunning movieso what goes on in well the bride played by uma thurman wakes up after 4 years coma and wants to have revenge on the people who caused this state to her so slash slash bang bang boom boom thats about it this could have been one lousy movie happily it isnt it is action at is finestmain character is the bride who is having her roaring revenge against bill played by david carradine not shown in vol 1 only heard as a voice lucy liu does fine job as a half japanese yakuza boss prettily dressed in kimono but from all the baddies in is oneeyed elle driver portrayed by daryl hannahso what else yes theres lots of chopping in this movie and i mean lots so i can honestly say not for the smallest members of your family all action is very cartoony and visually impressivei liked it worth of 8 out of 10,cruel
the more films tarantino makes the more obvious the truth iswhile he undeniably has style theres just no substance the bride seeks revengewell thats it and knowing from the off that she had already killed oren made the subsequent hour an exercise in tedium and theres only so much ludicrous cartoon violence instead of story one can take without just falling asleep its all been done before and not having seen the second part and frankly after this without even a shred of curiosity to do so i imagine the plot synopsis to that will be the bride gets her revenge this film was just plain boring the only good thing about it was that at least tarantino stayed behind the camera,cruel
after the first 25 minutes of killing bill and all his associates what changes  an hour later its still more of the samewhat rates this as a good film plot character development action tired originality remember the japanese godzilla movies of the 50s and 60s  this is an update using people and kung funo  nothing makes this a film of any substance originality or meritunless you are on the right for this drivel drug or have narrowed your psyche to generate massive amounts of euphoric endorphins from wellchoreographed but relentless mindnumbing sequences of meaningless violence    passi couldnt wait to see how badly 2 would bomb,cruel
just cant really say how baffled i am at the praise piled onto this film which never really gets any higher than a tribute to spaghetti westerns and kung fu films what little bit of plot that you do have is simple and just used as a tool to bring you to the next homage from qt you cant really judge this film on the acting either since it is a tribute to films that really arent known for acting and kb 1 surely doesnt break the mold the blood shooting out like a fountain was funny the first time but becomes increasingly absurd after it was shown over and over the action scenes arent and are shot very well the film certainly isnt lacking style but unfortunately substance is sorely lacking if that is your taste great but if not isnt for you,cruel
replacing the former winner start the revolution without me volume 1 had nothing of interest or value other than a plethora of swordfighting stunts  this movie was crouching tiger hidden dragon only without the artistic beauty or plotmr tarantino made 1 good movie pulp fiction and has proven even an avant garde persona can produce a bad filmi would run from anything else mr tarantino puts in the can this movie was awfuli dont know anyone personally who thought this movie had value my 2 cents,cruel
do i seem sadistic i have seen this at least 15 times and never in theaters till today one of the most content feelings and experiences ever easily my 3rd favorite quentin tarantino after once upon a time in hollywood and pulp fiction i absolutely love the hints at many of his other films and the music is delightful the sweet camera shots is bombastic along with the impressive sound effects  quite literally gets me jacked up how much i love this movie,cruel
his ode to japanese cinema merging western tropes with eastern aesthetics blending stylised filters utilising excessive spraying blood and embedding the art of japanese animation tarantino directs the absolute heck out of this revenge thriller temporarily acquiring the souls of kurosawa and miike to combine epic samurai showdowns with modern limbslicing gore not to mention turning thurman into the thurminator despite not being the greatest film in his illustrious filmography its definitely his most technically proficient after being left for dead by a group of assassins a bride seeks revenge by eliminating two of the five members after acquiring a legendary hattori hanzo katanatarantino for me can come across as pretentious at the best of times divulging into his own selfindulgence more times than jackson appears in his films dont get me wrong hes no malick but its a turn off rather than a turn on fortunately his intent focus on the directorial flair as opposed to the ambitiously ostentatious dialogue found in the majority of his earlier films meant that was able to overcome his wearisome witimmediately it kicks off with thurman decimating a suburban house with nothing more than a few kicks knife slashes and a cup of coffee tarantino setting the bar high with pleasing choreography proving his versatility as a genre director the ornate topdown tracking shots to showcase the set designs the ingenious use of profoundly heightened volume of stock sound effects found in classic japanese arts especially the profound swinging of a sword swoosh woosh or the impalement of a blade through the chest as if it came directly from dragonball z its abrupt its harsh its tarantino in a nutshellthen the narrative switches back and forth between the present time the aftermath of the wedding and even further in the past with character backstory presented in absolute stunning anime the erratic narrative jumps do skew the momentum on multiple occasions although many will initially reject ishiis backstory style it compliments tarantinos creative exploration into asian cinema perfectly and even allows more bloodshed to spill off the screen limbs flying in every direction heads imploding from bullets and japanese steel piercing the hearts of innocents a perfect chapterchapter four atleast i think it was dips the pacing with an overextended sequence at a sushi bar which unfortunately doesnt particularly highlight thurmans acting range but tarantino brings it back into sixth gear with the inevitable chapter five that every viewer will claim to be their favourite segment of the volumes and its true the showdown against the crazy 88 is one of the greatest sequences in cinematic history commencing with a glorious one take walkthrough of the interior before issuing thurman with an endless wave of subordinates to slash through beautiful the perfect blend of two continental cinemasmy only gripe is tarantinos excessive overstylisation choices to which he chose to shroud the onslaught in a monochromatic filter its better in colour believe me atleast it concludes sensationally with a gorgeous duel with ishii in a snowfilled garden leaving the viewer to eagerly anticipate the sequel praise must be given yet again to the soundtrack as with all of his films the blend of songs and an original score is sublime actually its perfect complimenting every scene audaciously with excellence particularly the slowmotion entrancesand thats pretty much how one could describe this film excellent its not his best but to allow thurman hannah and even liu to shine in a gory swordwielding extravaganza well its something special authentically western with the exuberance of japanese cinema an outstanding love letter by a craftsman at the peak of his power,cruel
its a silly action movie excessive gore but the action is actually really good great sword fights for the type of movie its definitely missing a montage,cruel
i am a tarantino fan and movies like this are the reason why i noticed a lot of derogatory comments from people who were obviously not fans im not one to watch movies i dont like just so i can trash it in a review perhaps i have found a better way to spend my time than others if you are a tarantino fan or a fan of certain movie genres i would recommend his work,cruel
i had a discussion this week about whether or not an excessive amount of tributes and homages within a film makes for a great movie or one worthy of derision it all depends on how well remixed the source material is when it comes to the two movies the multiple references are so dense that theres almost an art to how they come together and the places theyre gathered from are so disparate and nonmainstream the fact that theyve coalesced into a hollywood blockbuster is pretty amazinga woman in a wedding dress  who we come to know as the bride and black mamba  lies wounded and possibly dying in a chapel in el paso texas shes been attacked and left for dead by the deadly viper assassination squad with what may be her final breath she tells bill their leader that shes pregnant with his child he responds by shooting her in the headthe film jumps forward four years and the bride uma thurman who helped conceive this movie with writerdirector quentin tarantino has hunted down one of the vipers copperheadvernita green vivica a fox who has now become a homemaker our heroine tries to give her target a break and offers to meet her to battle somewhere that her family isnt in the crossfire she responds by trying to shoot and kill the bride who dispatches her easily with a knife to the heartwe go back now those four long years to when the bride was in a coma california mountain snakeelle driver daryl hannah perfection in this movie whistles her way through the hallways of a hospital dressed as a nurse with a matching eyepatch ready to kill the bride with a lethal injection however bill decides to cancel the kill order as he finds it dishonorablethe bride wakes up realizes shes no longer with child and begins her mission of revenge by killing the hospital worker whos been raping her while she was in a coma she takes his truck and begins the long journey toward learning how to walk and fight againthe first viper who is on her kill list is cottonmouthoren ishii lucy liu who has risen to become the leader of a huge clan of tokyo yakuza as a child orens parents were murdered and she spent her early years getting her own revengethe bride seeks to have a sword made by hattori hanzo sonny chiba who has vowed to never forge a sword again but after he learns that she wants revenge on his former student bill he makes one for hertracking oren to the house of blue leaves the bride  we dont learn her name until the next movie but you can see it on her plane ticket to tokyo  wipes out orens gang the crazy 88s and her bodyguard schoolgirl with a spiked yoyo gogo yubarishe then kills oren and tortures her assistant sofie fatale to discover where bill is the film ends with bill speaking to sofie and asking if the bride knows that their daughter is alivethis film was tarantinos attempt to move from the talky fare he was known for and into the action cinema that he loves the house of blue leaves battle took six weeks longer than expected but thats because its packed with traditional special effects and stuntwork instead of the cgi were now used toobviously is inspired by grindhouse cinema drawing inspiration from the shaw brothers sergio leone and lucio fulci amongst many others weve gone indepth to breakdown the actual films that it takes inspiration from in this article trust us  there are so many sometimes multiple references within one shotaccording to uma thurman tarantino asked her to watch three movies to prepare the killer coffy and a fistful of dollarsoriginally intended as one movie the fourhour runtime was considered too long for filmgoers so this was split in two separate movies its pretty astounding that after all the death and destruction in this film the bride only has one kill left in the sequelreminds me of the beastie boys pauls botique there are hundreds of samples all over that album which make it a much richer experience if you know where they all come from but if you dont you can still dance to it,cruel
and considered one of the best movies of the tarantino and not for less has a great script great actors highlighted to a great uma thurman track as usual and in the tarantino movies some scenes are a bit insaggerated with lots of blood but of rest another masterpiece by tarantino,cruel
isnt supposed to be believable is gory ridiculous its pure unfiltered tarantino is cool brilliant timeless classic which is exactly what to expect from quentin vol 1 and 2 are one of those kind of movies that i have to watch every time i see it on cable it just never gets old,cruel
if you love martial arts as much as i do and hot women weilding swords this film is for you the soundtrack is awesome,cruel
wasting of 2 hours  you dont need to see this movie fighting scenes are dull,cruel
just perfectperhaps the best movie of tarantino with excellent story music and acting bill is not showing in this film but when your hear his voice or see hum to walk is enough for fearing himthe bride is the best fighter on this planet  seeking her revenge which deservesmany victims  blood  blood  and more blood but without to bother you just see it and you definetely you will enjoy it,cruel
i am speechless how to praise such a real gem of movieuma thurman has given a greatest performance never can be given by any other actress such a fearless fighter never been portrayed ever before never will be on screen  standing ovation for both uma thurman  tarantino  great movie,cruel
this is an excellent film amazing choice of music,cruel
i thought it was a great film the fight scenes and over dramatisation that are charictaistic of quinton tarintino were done as always to a t the characters and story making were also good as was the way they interacted  the dialog all that i felt brought the film down was the music which didnt fit well in scenes and rewind the mood a great deal,cruel
is a funny and exciting movie to watch totally tarantino style is there blood yes tons of it do the characters curse a lot yes quite a lot is it realistic not much pretty exaggerated in a lot of aspectsfollows the story of the bride an exassassin that tried to leave the killing lifestyle after knowing that she was pregnant but instead got betrayed by her old assassination squad the deadly viper leaving her in a coma for 4 years she now must seek revenge this is the type of movie that just fells good to watch my dad used to go to the movies to watch bruce lee and now i go to the movies to watch i dont go the movies that often but when i do my goal is not come out from the theater deeply inspired crying or almost falling asleep when i go to the movies i want to have fun watching something well designed a small piece of art and thats exactly what delivers the great visuals a soundtrack that perfectly fits the film the crazy fights and the creativity in creating the characters and their story just make this film so entertaining to watch yes is not a super sentimental or meaningful film but its not supposed to beyou might be thinking but man it just looks like a movie with chicks kicking each other ass and ill quote myself no its chicks kicking each other ass with style,cruel
tarantino wears his influences proudly on his sleeve with this movie its a love letter to the kung fu craze of the 70s and the uberviolence of hong kong cinemai loved every minute of this movie despite the absurdity of much of it its suppose to be ott and off the wall thats the whole point of itits like marmite youll either love it or hate it,cruel
whereas reservoir dogs 1991 and pulp fiction 1994 took elements from the french new wave and american independent cinema of the 1970s to create bold iconic character driven films rife with clever dialog uncompromising violence and subtle allusions to a myriad of varied textured film references volumes 1  2 20032004 take the idea of referencing even further giving us blatant and literal references that cross from one genre to the next with a complete disregard for whether or not the audience is familiar with the kind of work being quoted this technique is pushed even further in the subsequent death proof 2007 which really does require an audience to be familiar with its subject in order to get the most out of the style setup and intent here all pretensions to the cinema of the french new wave are dropped as well as the more adultorientated flavour of the previous jackie brown 1997 which was perhaps more in keeping with the aging spirit of the blacksploitation subgenre of films from which it drew a superficial influenceinstead 2003 finds director quentin tarantino shifting his focus to asian cinema and referencing sources as disparate as kungfu 1972 lone wolf and cub 1972 lady snowblood 1973 the street fighter 1974 shogun assassin 1980 and ichi the killer 2001 as well as taking direct influence from the shaw brothers studio productions of the 1960s and filmmakers like kinji fukasaku and seijun suzuki alongside these visual and thematic reference points we also have a continual reliance on juxtaposing ideas and iconography taken from spaghetti westerns blacksploitation pictures chinese wuxia and kung fu movies japanese manga and anime hiphop american exploitation and revenge cinema and franois truffauts the bride wore black 1968 these influences are all combined sometimes obviously and sometimes with more subtlety but all used with flair imagination and intelligence to create the right kind of cinematic environment for this purposely elaborate overthetop comicbookstyle tale of roaring rampage and revenge to play out againstthe opening shot is fantastic rife with cinematic allusions to sergio leones a fistful of dollars 1964 and seijun suzukis tokyo drifter 1965 with the use of black and white cinematography and the image of the iconic bride laid out on her back bloody and bruised pleading for her life with an offscreen bill who is about to put a bullet in her head from here we cut to the title and the neariconic use of nancy sinatras version of the sony bono track bang bang which is every bit as bold amusing cool and ironic as the use of opening music in other tarantino works from here we cut back and forth in a nonlinear progression to track the return and subsequent revenge of the bride against the gang of devious former comrades who betrayed heras the film is split into two halves for commercial reasons as opposed to artistic but regardless tying in with the literary use of voiceover chapterheading an unreliable narrator etc there will always be the question of how to critique it do we view them as two separate films that should each deliver on the characteristics that we think cinema should pertain to or do we view this as one long film a continuation of a single character and theme over the course of two very different though ultimately linked feature films if we take the former approach then volume 1 2003 is the easiest film to appreciate on an immediate level concerning itself more with scenes of balletic visually rich and heavily choreographed action relegating much of tarantinos usual interplay of character and dialog to the background and allowing the visuals to completely envelope us in this sense tarantino is drawing on the bcinema popart explosion of suzuki most notable in the sequence where the bride takes on the crazy88s amidst a barrage ostentatious camera movements lighting changes black and white intercutting and bouncing gogo music from the 5 6 7 8sthere are also elements of over the top martial arts choreography juxtaposed against scenes of more brutal harderhitting violence obvious miniature work that almost points to the original godzilla films retro use of rearscreen projection allusions to films as disparate as twisted nerve 1968 hitchcock brian de palmas elaborate use of splitscreen the production design from gate of flesh 1964 and sex and fury 1974 the casting of chiaki kuriyama perhaps familiar to most audience from her appearances in fukasakus battle royale and bruce lees game of death 1978 though these elements are impressive particularly when coupled with the scenes of overthetop violence which nods to the exaggerated bloodshed of anime and of films like the aforementioned shogun assassin and ichi the killer and the technical virtuosity of tarantino and cinematographer robert richardson the effect can seem hollow especially when we crossreference this to the much more reserved dialogdriven volume 2 2004with this in mind it would seem more appropriate to view the films as one single film taking into account both the bursts of colour and energy presented in volume 1 and the slower more characterdriven approach of volume 2 to really get the most out of the incredible journey that this larger than life character undertakes it also allows us to better appreciate the extraordinary performance from uma thurman in the central role who here gives one of the best performances of her career instilling the bride with a sense of honour and purpose that makes her violence and bloodshed all the more understandable volume 1 doesnt quite scale the dizzying heights of tarantinos first three films lacking the intuitive style unique dialog and intricate plotting  but it does represent a new phase of his career one that pushes cinematic reference even further to create a visual tapestry of selfaware cinema that appeals to learned cineastes preoccupied with technique as well as offering a bold story memorable characters and a great sense of entertainment,cruel
i saw this film without reading anything about it i enjoyed pulp fiction reservoir dogs and from dusk till dawn and was hoping for something similarthe special effects were good good job the gore was overplayed in a comical fashion otherwise this could have been a very depressing film the acting was good it is well put together in summary a well polished movie  with one enourmous flawwhere was the plot did i blink at an inopportune moment i am amazed that this film was split into two parts the storyline so far leaves a lot to be desired and could have been told in a few minutesif you are looking for a popcorn movie for wasting a couple of hours sitting in a cinema this is the one for you if you are looking for something to push the boundaries and give you something to think about  you had better look elsewhere,cruel
volume 1to use a metaphor if reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown all feel like ford caminos cruising down a backalley l a street at about 35 mph then is a yamaha crotch rocket motorcycle zipping down the highway at 150 mph  the difference is extraordinaryall of tarantinos trademark details are in volume 1  everything from red apple cigarettes to the box of cereal that appears in every tarantino film including the level of violence in his filmviolence is a strong subject in tarantino films which turns off many lesscapable viewers  it is that same strength of violence that propels above the rest  everything from tarantinos trademark gunrelated blood splatters to an exaggerated number of kurosawaesque arterial spurts to an anime short to the levels of blood that had to be colorfiltered into black and white as in raging bull the body count and the severed limb count rise above every mainstream hollywood movie before itas this is an action movie this is not completely unsurprising unsettling images and thoughts are another hallmark of tarantino and this one pulls it out in spades  lucy lius character is setup with a particular disturbing aeon fluxstyle anime short that involves a gruesome murder and the mention of child violence  actually theres two potential moments of child violenceas such tarantino again masters his ability to call back to movies of before to bring these characters and moments to life  cliches of hong kong chopsocky martial arts films and american westerns to edgy modern cinema such as fight club and back to japanese samurai epics are resurrected in an age where they are not appreciated because of their ageas such there is little room for the swaying character development that is a hallmark of tarantino  a meager revenge plot facilitated with assassins and other unsavory characters  but no one should care if its a little shallow on the plot  its fun fast disturbingly highintensity action at its besthow would this movie compare to the matrix or crouching tiger hidden dragon  never loses sight of the major themes and the strength of the central character to push through to the other side as both of the previous movies do with their artificial complexity  instead uses a multitude of cinematic ideas to express the same thought and process revengerarely does a movie deserve its hype  volume 1 deserves it and more1010  tarantino scores big with this action movie,cruel
vol 1 is many more things than almost any other movie it has many many layers despite the fact that it is essentially a onenote revenge story and really there is nothing wrong with thatno spoilersone of the many things that make this movie excellent is its character development every substansial character is so welldeveloped with their stories and characteristics revealed on the screenworth pointing out the movie is at times ridiculous surreal and fantastical and it works especially in the homages the flying and floating and high leaps the bride having a samurai sword on the plane in open view the gushing and spraying of gallons of blood are obviously not to be taking seriously and are fun to watchis also very emotionally draining at times the bride getting shot in the head her comatose body being used for sex losing her baby her family her everything orenishi seeing her parents being brutally slaughtered in front of her vernita greens 4yearold daughter seeing her mother murderedthe black and white sequence at the showdown at the house of blue leaves will be controversial the way i felt about it is that the change from colour to black and white is like a symbolism of the brides killing of dozens of people the killing eventually just becomes cold emotionless plain to the bride and then colour returns and after killing a few more people she lets a young yakuza go which is very appropriate of her because of the reason she is seeking vengencethe last 30 seconds are as good as it gets in terms of ending the first volume and segwaying for the nextexcellent movie great action acting story visuals and homages and much more,cruel
volume one is a film about cold blooded revenge its a classic quentin tarantino flick complete with extra gore over dramatic kungfu sound effects and an eclectic soundtrack its a story that matches that of a lost japanese ronin warrior seeking revenge for the loss of their master only in this case the master betrayed the ronin themselves the film is outrageously fun from beginning to end and keeps you locked in the entire time the editing techniques bring back memories of old school kungfu flicks and yet lets us know that they are top notch for the year this film came outthe editing in this film is amazing the story starts out with uma thurmans character the bride her real name isnt discovered until the second film being brutally beaten and shot in the head it locks your attention in with this and then bounces back and forth in her timeline it engages immediately and locks you in for the rest of the ride this films use of flashbacks and cut scenes makes it what it is at one point the main antagonists back story is told in an anime format that is unexpected and yet fits this film so perfectly it pays respect to japanese culture in throughout the entire film in a way thats feels unobtrusivethe use of close ups in this film are extremely important to its motif it makes it all feel so personal as if you were betrayed yourself and are seeking vengeance every time the camera pans into the brides face you can feel her hurt you can literally see the rage on her face and want her to complete her mission so desperately i cant remember a time i was this engaged with a film like thisfinally the eclectic soundtrack makes for an exciting joyride it bounces from a playful teasing feeling to a dramatic overtone that helps you understand how each character is feeling and yet lets you know how out of control this film is at one point the bride engages in combat with 88 yakuza gang members at the same time the music flips from japanese gogo music that excites you to a theatrical song several times in the same fight sequence it is jarring and funny and yet so severe that it helps you to understand that this film is here to rock you out of your seatthis film draws its roots from 70s kungfu films she even wears a yellow jumpsuit that resembles bruce lee in game of death all in all this is an instant classic and i encourage anyone who wants a gore filled rollercoaster of an action film to watch it,cruel

up a book and go nuts subscribe to some trusted personal finance blogs and go on youtube listen to motivational videos and personal finance concepts instead of watching cat videos although that one

from the easiest to the hardest goal which is to ultimately confront bill  the assassin leaderthe truth is despite me knowing she was the hero in the movie i could not help but wonder how she was going to accomplish her goal this is exactly what made her plan execution even more fascinatingshe focused on one goal at a time cross it off her list and then moved to the next one sometimes it is

a yellow jumpsuit a lethal hattorihanzo sword and a charismatic blonde taking bloody vengeance yeah you got it its the notorious the same movie that i am certain got hundreds of nave cinephiles running to the toilet to force the impression of the film out of their stomach and yet despite not being everyones cup of tea the universe is meticulously constructed in such a unique way that compels you to give it the least a trythe story goes as such a woman and past member of the deadly international viper assassination squad is pregnant and ready to walk down the aisle however such a conspicuous past doesnt ensure much tranquility and that becomes evident by the surprise arrival of the other members of the squad to the brides wedding who with the aid of their machine guns fill the chapel with rotting bodies and leave the blonde protagonist in a four year coma the tale presents a dark twist when the physically and psychologically beaten bride wakes up only to find out that the fetus is missing thats when things start to get bad as the incensed bride swears to revenge all the traitors responsible for this tragedy wreaking bloody chaos in her passing sounds compelling enoughno then lets talk about the heroine the bride whose name we are constantly refused to used to be one the most talented and dangerous members of her squad she is a determined and unstoppable force of nature and her efficiency is combined with undeniable physical beauty she is a carnivorous flower perfectly fitting to the violent tarantino world and this world is violent and ruthless in every sense of the words it is crystal clear not only in the characters behavior are oren ishii the icy and calculating killer and elle driver the oneeyed femme fatale ringing any bells but also in the scenery tarantino uses bold colours innumerable pounds of blood and even a nauseating anime sequence to underline this exact cruelty and madness lurking deep in the human psyche the film is a celebration of human instincts in their most crude and therefore perilous form embellished with carefully chosen pieces of music and subtle references to the oldfashioned genre of 70s kungfu moviesif you are still nodding your head indifferently then dont bother to watch the movie and torment yourself for no good reason pick one of the thousand other movies waiting patiently in the shelves of video stores and leave for another time maybe someday you will feel challenged enough to watch it,cruel

i had heard mixer reviews about the but part one was a blast truly awsome action film it manages to introduce an interesting story characters and action very quickly making it intriguing aa the film roles on it keeps feeding the audience snipits of information driving the main characters story making the audience root for her and understand her motives despite her being a merciless killeralso that fight scene at the endwow amazing stunning directing very enjoyable and a great tarentiono movie its just ashame i didnt find vol2 as good,cruel
tarantino is a huge talent love his unique style how he brings every part of the story and puts them together into the absolutely fantastic performance beauty revenge action those dialogs like no other,cruel
ive heard about this movie from multiple people about being an amazing film so i had some high expectations going into this film especially since i liked pulp fiction so much i kept waiting for this film to wow me but it never happened and i found myself pretty bored throughout the movie the issue with this film is the tone and the pacing it kind of drags on in a way that eventually i stop caring and look forward to the movie being over it also comes off as forced in a lot of ways like theyre trying too hard its hard to explain maybe it has to do with the editing its a shame that i didnt like this film i was hoping i would and honestly thought i would given it has such high reviews,cruel
at the time came out movies were a totally minor thing in my life i watched them relatively often but i did not payed any attention to details i had no idea who the director was and the question is whether i knew at all what the director was besides uma thurman i think i never heard of other actors back then i rated movies on a very simple scale  whether its fun or not this one was fun for a ten fifteen years and several thousand films later i look at movies from a completely different angle and fun is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones now i analyze them in more detail and i still havent found any flaws in this oneit could be said that quentin tarantinos talent is a gift from god but i think its far more likely that he sold his soul to the devil the lowest rating i have ever given to one of his films is nine and im not a fanboy is an action thriller and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art but tarantinos ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating the story is crazy and great but the least important camera work fight choreography use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema the cast is more than good and tarantino manages to get the most out of them i doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie and of course music music is very diverse totally unexpected often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows yet again in such a perfect disharmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography that it all leaves the viewer breathless for movies like this one even ten is depreciation1010,cruel
10 out of 10  the hype was deserved this time  best film i have seen in years  cant wait for volume two  i dont remember an entire audience clapping at the end of a film before  its pulp fiction meets the martial arts genre crossed with reservoir dogs meets a western  violence humour amazing looks great dialogue superb soundtrack fabulous direction and brilliant choreography  tarantino takes inspiration from everywhere and creates a fantastic blend of over the top violent stylish entertainment the casting is perfect  uma carries the film so well  she portrays the pain and anger from the brutal storyline so well  and lucy lui is terrific as the murderous yakuza boss  there is so much action and some of the best and most bloody fight scenes ive seen  thankfully the wire fu is kept to a minimum  warning  expect a lot of blood  a real lot of blood spraying blood from severed limbs and heads  but its done with great comic book style  dont go if you dislike violent movies but if you dont mind them then do see this movie  some may say the plot is thin or there is not enough dialogue but this is a film where style over substance really works another masterpiece from tarantino,cruel
is a fraud terrible terrible movie spoilersspoilers within this post enter at your own riski just got back from the noon showing of in which the theatre was half full for a noon showing that is huge the theatre is one of the bigger ones at the queensway in toronto so it will do well this weekend what i witnessed in that 100 minutes in the theatre can only be described as tarantinos flipping of the bird to all of us as he looks in the mirror and congratulates himself on being the smartest man in the world straight up is one of the biggest disappointments i have seen in my life after masterpieces like reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and other greats like true romance you would think that would live up to those lofty expectations bestowed upon it by virtue and name recognition alone but not only has tarantino told us all to  off he he has done it while laughing in our faceshas all of tarantinos quirky and weird trademarks in it and it contains strange techniques that at first you think is simply an homage to a film genre but in reality what qt did here was get too cute and at the expense of artistic integrity what we are left with is more matrix style garbage a 10 minute anime introduction to lucy luis character black and white photography for no reason and the bleeping out of the brides name just because he can all of this is looked at as being brilliant by the critics and those in similar circles because tarantino has a free pass right now his films have enamoured critics for 10 years now and this one is no different even though it is a shadow of the opulence that we are used to from him to sum it up this film is all style and has no substance the style is there but for what purpose why does he choose to do the things that he does is it just because he can or is it because he thinks he is so much more clever than the rest of us you guys thought matrix reloaded was pretentious this film might as well be the architect meets socrates meets locke meets rouseau meets japanese smart guy meets marx that is how it comes across pretentious doesnt even begin to describe it there is even a blatant rip off of the burly brawl in this film right down to beings jumping up a flight of steps to come and meet the heroinei knew i was in trouble five minutes into the film when it just didnt feel right you know how in pulp you just knew you were in for something special you just felt it with the dialogue the acting the soundtrack and everything that encompassed the film well has the opposite feel to it none of that magic is present and it is just a bunch of people getting sliced and diced and maimed there is no snappy dialogue and that is what qt is good at tarantino is a lyrical genius and he abandons that here and goes wachowski brothers on us and it just doesnt worki despised this film with every fibre of my body shame on you qt shame on you for starting to believe everything that was said about you110,cruel
awesome crazy comic movie ive ever seen so far its the best awesome action sequences both in this movie  its vol 2  they are both really well done movies no need of over the top animationsvisual effects this movie shows it brilliantly by its well choreographed crazy action scenes  shows off the martial artsjapanese action genre very well for me its a superhero movie at its best even without any elaborate costumes or visual effects awesome storyline  the plot comes out very well throughout the movie though watching of vol2 is required to get any closure since she kills him in vol2 i dont watch these crime or revenge movies a lot but i loved this one  i would watch it again  again on the tv awesome dialogs  quotes in this movie which are said by amazing performance giving cast in the movie i seriously love uma thurman in this movie  its vol2 too this movie has some intense  drama elements too over the top blood spills but i didnt mind them at all because you have to take them in a funny  a comic sense i especially loved the part where the bride tells the story of oren ishii through a cartoon sequence awesome soundtrack  the music  everything is so enjoyable while watching the movie this is a movie that is an instant classic along with its vol2  will always be remembered in the history of the film industry,cruel
i very rarely take the time to write reviews on here unless i feel extremely strongly about a film and in this case i find it quite difficult to fathom how this garbage has any good reviews i was honestly looking forward to seeing it for the first time after hearing about how many people enjoyed it and knowing what a famous film it is reading the synopsis it sounded like a movie with a good storyline and a lot of potential i also am normally one to love a bit of bloodshed in action thriller horror or scifi films but this movie was just totally ridiculous and over the top about half the movie was in what i assume was japanese with no subtitles which really didnt make it any more difficult to figure out what was happening in regards to the storyline but it did make the film a whole lot more frustrating to watch and with much of the dialogue in japanese as well it really stopped me as from engaging feeling sorry for or connecting with any of the characters good for you if you speak english and japanese i suppose the worst part though was all the absurd violence i was literally staring in disgust and shaking my head in disbelief the whole movie contains graphic violence all of it entirely ridiculous there are people getting limbs hacked off left right and centre with fountains of blood spurting from the wounds psychotic 17 year old girls who like killing things and a fight scene where around 200 people cant take down one whackjob woman i can see the humour in unrealistic violence when its done in a light hearted sense and i can also see the point of some more heavy violence to create a certain atmosphere but in this movie what was meant to be a serious plot was utter rubbish with people losing more blood than what would even be insides someones body to begin with it was totally unnecessary unbelievable and without the ability to draw any emotional reaction not only this but half the movie was in animation once again preventing any attachment or interest in any of the characters wellbeing i understand possibly this movie was meant to be of the arthouse genre but even so it was disengaging ridiculous boring and downright stupid like someone made it up as they went along and ran out of time before the end the only half decent thing throughout the whole movie was the music but if thats of any interest i suggest downloading the soundtrack rather than wasting your time on this atrocity i sat through the whole thing hoping the ending would redeem the rest of the film but was wrong im kicking myself for electing to watch this stupid film instead or sherlock holmes bah,cruel
at first sigh  only delight colors choreography manga slices fight scenes as huge show in fact only a fairy tale cruel fantastic almost amazing a form of art in large proportions and perfect cast revenge duty honor and rules a miracle and a way without end river of blood art of sword and lights of lights circles nothing new from this director but really impressive for the virtues of mixed video game thriller oriental crumbs and sure japanese animation a good ironic iconic product and great role for uma thurman strange and nice ball of emotions and perfect prey for tarantino fans nothing else because is a kind of legend without measure and beautiful sparkles of shadows,cruel
vol 1 is a terrific movie with a great storyfantastic castbrilliant characters and plenty of violencemaybe a bit too much violence for a sensitive viewerit is without a doubt some of quentin tarantinos finest workwith an outstanding performance from uma thurmanwho seemed to be in to her crazyinsanerevenge seeking character the bride all the way throughi think basically everyone who was part of this movie was interested in ittheres no wonder the movie was so long that they had to break it up in to two partsthe bride uma thurmana master assassinis out seeking to kill a man she has a great history withhoweverbill has sent out many people to get herbut they myth have no chance against her as she seeks her revenge,cruel
this film is essentially a real life cartoon with everything that happens being exaggerated and the use of actually cartoon imagery being used really makes this film unique although i do wish that a slight bit more cartoon imagery had been used it was still extremely enjoyable to watch others would say that is may be pointless due to the exaggeration of everything in the storylinebeing a tarantino film it has the usual kind of weird perspectives and this film really uses music to its advantage helping to create images that are sure to stick in any viewers mind my particular favourite part was how music was integrated into the film a the very beginning with bang bang by nancy sinatra this part has really stayed in my mind as it tells you so much about the story even though it has nothing to do with itother highlights included the fluency of the fighting scenes and how they were not just all tricks of the camera by changing camera perspectives although the fighting was unrealistic that is what gave the film its charm the characters were all quite shallow but this again added to the feel of the film and i believe this was intended especially being a tarantino fanall in all i really enjoyed this film in all of its blood and gore and its almost comedy in how blunt it was the whole time it is not for the faint hearted but is definitely for anyone who likes something a little different and enjoys the oriental culture and quirkiness that this film has,cruel
to start out for everyone here this movie is yet an another horrible adaptation or a remake of the japanese cult movie lady snowblood shurayukihime from 1973 directred by toshiya fujita quentin tarantinos version is a completely ripoff with switched elements and to make things worse with a whole bunch of incorrect facts about the whole japanese society and its criminal gangs in the beginning i though this was a entertainment film lots of action and a somewhat ridiculous and funny story but it was after the middle of the film i started to realise that ive seen this before  at that moment i didnt knew from which movie although lady snowblood was in my mind like everyone from the west who watches asian movies of any kind they feel a needing for actually make their own versions and put themselves in the centre like telling the world that we can do it just as good as you just watch ustheres no exceptions for this one either here we can see how uma thurman replaces the cult role meiko kajiyuki kashima shurayukihime had as the avenger without any feeling or remorse umas role figure is a wandering slaughter machine waving and kicking her opponents down without backing off even if there is like 88 of them or just two gogo yubari herself is only a symbol for the westerns own childish erotic imagination of japanese school girls in uniforms in general those who says that this movie is a smart intelligent master piece which belongs to the cult movies through the time they havent seen lady snowblood nor understood what quentin tarantino really did with this film copied and destroyed an already existing legend i like pupl fiction csi crime scene investigation and from dusk to dawn but this one i wish could fall down into the deepest black hole in the universe thank you,cruel
the movie was pretty entertaining i especially enjoyed it because of the style butim afraid thats everything i liked about it that or i couldnt notice the so called art everybody is talking about the story is like every kung fu movies you are used with garbage i read a lot of reviews about this movie here everybody omg tarantino is so brilliant hes a genius once again qt makes a masterpiece qt there qt here and so on i am just wondering if such a movie was made by uwe boll would you guys say its a masterpiece no you would definitely say its garbage crap a torture to watch it thats exactly what my friends who havent heard of qt said and thats exactly the reason why people like it because its a qt work nothing else if he made pulp fiction after this movie he wouldnt get so much credit about that one either and i hope one day his reputation will fall cause he doesnt deserve it not anymore if you like qt and you think everything made by him is good go watch it if you appreciate real cinema run as fast as you can dont even watch the beginning cause this movie is all about style no story no cinema,cruel
i just felt to write this critic as being a true follower of tarantino that i believe needs to be expanded his work in killbill is somewhat intense and entertaining but as time goes i cant help finding weak spots on killbill i think people are trying to find a reason to admire it quentin is a movie lover and this movie is his ultimate homage to his movie library of favorites yet i found somehow deviated of what his sense of homage is is his tribute to old westerns spaghettis and oriental films just a pastiche of unnecessary blood mistaken for art and his intended cool characters lose flame as they blade swords into rambling yet somehow interesting fights have we granted permission to quentin to do as he pleases with the camera the power we gave to quentin led him to believe he could enjoy the midas touch his handling on the filmical elements are wonderful yet the movie lacks a message and a clear concept more than a mixed tribute his passion overwhelmed him and audience accepts it as a work of art by a master mind ill grant you the latter killbill is pretty harmless mostly meaningless but altogether a load of splatteredarms and head chopping fun,cruel
first of all i am not a fan of tarantinos style hes a one trick pony his style utterly wrecks many stories occasionally his trick is successful such as in four rooms and jackie brown i know this isnt a review of those movies but i have to say this tarantinos style fit exactly with four rooms making the movie worth watching when the character development and writing was mediocre to poor in some cases in brown his style may have added positive appeal to the movie im not sure brown had great acting story actors characters disregarding the tarantino style but the flicks had none of these things with no acting and phenomenally bad writing coupled with tarantinos wayoverthetop kamikaze slashandburn cinematography literally s richly undeserved popularity is an example of what spending millions on prerelease hype can get you in a society made up of herd animals just as in the history of hitler and the holocaust also see the next presidential election may the biggest spender win the success of some presidential campaigns nazi atrocities and prerelease advertising are just three indicators of what a big herd of sheep we all are,cruel
i was just looking through the imdb top 100 how could a silly flick like score higher on the list than blade runner what a joke doesnt even belong in the same listwas a completely disconnected and silly movie with little substance coherence or cohesiveness it is more of a shaggy dog joke than a moviei cant imaging what criteria people are voting on is it just all the gore and ridiculous stunts it cant be plot story or acting because then it wouldnt be in the list it cant be plausibility or incorporation of interesting or novel concepts what is it,cruel
whats good the musical score is up to par with tarentinos usually excellent soundtracksthe action choreography is greattarentinos sense of humor shows througha bitwhat sucks the dialog is atrocious when compared to tarentinos other films its hard to believe its the same writerthe plot was overly simple again not up to his usual standardsall in all worth seeing if only to say youve seen it,cruel
the plot revolves around the bride aka beatrix kiddo uma thurman who goes on a two volume murderous spree to kill her mentor and lover bill david carradine after having her wedding rehearsal stopped and all inside the chapel killed in volume 1 vernita green vivica a foxand orenishii lucy lui who together with budd michael madsen and elle driver darryl hannah form part of bills deadly viper assassination squad are her targets with this film tarantino has certainly surpassed himself after giving us the classics reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown as usual for a tarantino film the soundtrack is perfect and the dialogue very witty tarantino does not spare the viewers from bloody scenes such as the one where the bride fights off orenishiis crazy 88 the film shifts from spaghetti western style in the opening sequence to oriental style in the last half of the movie tarantino goes as far as to show typical japanese cartoons to illustrate orenishiis life as a child this mixture is blended together perfectly by flawless acting a classical movie not to be missed by anyone,cruel
i have no idea why people like this movie opposie to pulp fiction this one is pretty bad it is boring bloody and pretty stupid with lots of plot holes i do not recommend this to anyone only if you have nothing else to do im glad i got it for free paying for cinema ticket would be real lost of money i understand some people my like it but why so many rated it so hight this is just out of my mind i just want to add i like other tarantno movies in this one he just went too far i will not even try to see the second part the most stupid was probably the 17 years old girl fighting the streams of blood again  not recomendet to anyone older then 12 but then it is to brutal for the 12 years old,cruel
this review contains some minor spoilers i only just saw this film after several years of hearing and seeing people rave about itseriouslywere they watching the same movie i just saw when tarantino did his start in the middle jump to the start then skip to the end trick in pulp fiction it was refreshing it was new it was different in a film with a simple plot like pf it workedin the same technique is just downright annoying i found myself thinking ohright if it worked once it must work every time right so far tarantino has a 50 hit rate as far as im concerned pf was terrific jackie brown was terrific reservoir dogs was a load of guff and has just joined rdi am neither queasy nor disturbed by cinematic violence but the fight in the restaurant was simply absurd someone might like to point out to quentin that having gallons of blood spray up like a garden hose just looks likewella red garden hose spray its not graphic its not disturbing its not even remotely interesting the entire fight scene in the restaurant would have been mildly interesting if two things had been done 1 a technical adviser with some medical training to point out to tarantino that traumatic severing of limbs results in very little bleeding since arteries go into spasm and2 a decent fight choreographer could have been hired you knowsomeone who doesnt fall for the tired old clich of the bad guys attacking the good guy one at a time while the rest circle around looking threateningthe only decent fight scene in the movie was the last one between umas character and oren that was a good fight scene and focused on the psychological side of kendostyle combatof course it was marred by the fact that we already knew oren lost the battle because her name was shown crossed off the list in the opening five minutes of the filmit is this last fight scene that allows me to give this film a 2 out of 10i dont expect crouching tiger hidden dragon or hero from quentin tarantinobut when mortal kombat has better fight choreography  and evangelion has more believable imagery  theres something seriously wrong,cruel
i understand from general movie scuttlebutt that tarantino never went to film school but rather learned everything he thinks he needs to know about making movies from watching movies while working as a clerk in a video rental store i was reminded of this over and over and over and over and over again as i watched the first hour of vol i it was like uber deja vu  every single scene in this movie looked like another scene from another movieyou know those smalltime bands that turn their wannabe mania into a career and pretend to be other popular bands calling their acts tributes i think something like that is going on with the q man he rocked with pulp fiction  no doubt about that  but seems to have used up all the original thoughts he ever had about moviemaking and can now only pay tribute to other directors in other words copy themi found this movie unbearably boring id rented both volumes from netflix and if id wanted to watch a jackie chan movie i would have ordered a jackie chan movie i watched the first hour of the first one and then sent them both back yecch a waste of time and money,cruel
i finally got to see first hand what all the fuss is all about unfortunately it is only half a movie so i am required to give it a rating of 4 expecting that after i see the second part i will have rated the entire movie as 8 qt obviously set out to make a spoof of the martial arts movies of asia and did a good job i really was entertained and use of the exaggerated spurting of blood when a head or limb was cut off reminded me that the film is not to be taken seriously plus the scene where the bride singleswordedly defeated a trained army of perhaps 30 or so martial arts experts was pure campthurman was a great choice to play the bride she moves well and has a comedic timing that just works well lucy liu is menacing as oren ishii daryl hannah as elle driver and david carradine as bill complete the main cast the whole story which is secondary to the look of the picture is bill having left the bride for dead at her wedding and after recovery in a hospital escapes and sets off the kill all those on her list this first installment shows us how she gets rid of the first half of her list i guess i will find out about the second half in due time to be continued ,cruel
fairly often i find myself pressured to justify my dislike of quentin tarantino movies ive taken to saying that i simply dont care about stories that involve killers killing killers thats tarantinos obsession  gangsters vs vampires hit men vs other hit men and here a vengeful exassassin vs her entire old gang every character involved is  forgive the george w bushism  evil and so i have no one to latch on to no one to root for uma thurmans bride is really only slightly less repulsive than her opponents and actually since david carradine is a better actor than thurman im tempted to root for billim glad that tarantino has found an outlet for hisahvision in movies because i shudder to think what else he could be doing right now i can admire his stuff only to a point because it carries such a deeply disturbing and disturbed taint the animated segment of comes across as particularly gratuitous and seems to serve no real purpose except to build up a villain who amounts to nothing muchive noticed that over the past few years certain filmmakers and writers seem determined to elevate the childish genres they loved in their youths to new levels of sophistication scifi horror super hero comics fantasy and now martial arts movies so we get lord of the rings adaptations that cost eight gazillion dollars great directors like ang lee and bryan singer devoting their talents to silly popcorn flicks and here an artyfarty version of all those grainylooking hong kong action yarns that are available on 5 dvds you know what sometimes schlock is just schlock i didnt really need to see a literate kung fu potboiler good photography can only elevate poor material so farin fairness i saw the closing scenes of vol ii and thought they were great but they contained little violence and were clearly more original than anything seen in volume i perhaps there is one good movie waiting to be discovered in the midst of two mediocre ones,cruel
i have read some of the previous comments concerning peoples expectations for this movie it seems like the majority at least of the ones i read felt this movie was a letdown the following are the main points i read and some rebuttals when appropriate1 i was expecting more from tarantino after having waited so long for a new filmgiven a few generations a good man becomes a god the same goes for expectations for movies you see a movie you really like you live a few years and then the same writerdirector comes out with a new movie and you are disappointed i havent seen a movie this well done in a long time when i comapare it to most of the films of today i am relieved to see such smart work2 the plot is stupidit has been hypothesized that there are only about 7 plots in the world you have to figure if you are going to do a movie you have to accept that much of what you will do has already been done what tarantino has done here is write a plot that works and then worked in the ingenuity betrayal revenge murder yeah yeah blah blah a summary of the movie simply doesnt do any justice i will explain why later3 tarantino took a bunch of stuff from a bunch of old kungfu movies and threw it all together into one moviethis is similar to 2 i think its important to be aware here that this was his intent and has always been his signature tarantino was probably raised on television and his memory for what he saw is insane he took his favorite elements of those movies and used them to make a collage and it worksnow for my critique of the film if i were to take any single element of this film and rate it without the context of the rest i might find this movie typical however the combination of camera movement retro nuances score framing storyline introduction and outcome and overall organization of events this film is top notch the creativity displayed in each scene the hidden references and allusions everything is so well packed if you keep your eyes open you will be impressed just dont take the kids,cruel
well i finally got round to watching and on the whole i have to say i was disappointedfrom tarantinowhos movies stand out as being fresh and inspiringi felt let down on several pointsi guess firstlythere was no pace to the filmnothing to want me to keep watching except maybe the hope that it was going to improve as it went onwhich it dida littlebut not enough for me to feel any emotion or intensitysecondlythe dialogueqts previous films had dialogue that kept you listeningno matter how trivial the subjectthere was always humourand a little something that made it memorablei felt here the dialogue was more like idle chit chat that really went no where buti did enjoy the fight scene with daryl hannahso hey it wasnt all badoverallan average film that i was really hoping to get more frommaybe ill watch it again and enjoy itwell see,cruel
the world was told it was great the world believes it is great what a total waste of film the only redeeming quality of this film was the well choreographed fight scenes so the two points i gave it actually go to the choreographer there are times graphic images are called for and times they can be artistically portrayed art in my humble opinion is the practice of expression leaving much to interpretation thereby provoking and inspiring the audience to be involved this film was not art it was a lecture nothing left to the imagination every last detail explicitly laid out to the point of complete boredom a flat declaration that there is no faith in the interpretive capabilities of the audience and the places that the audience is left to use their imagination are more in the area of making sense of the huge holes in the film only one of which being where we are expected to believe that after 4 years of atrophy in a coma umas still capable taking a 300 pound walrus of a man she killed him by attacking his tongue taking on another man and then wheelchairing herself outta there come on,cruel
a note of reality to any film fan planning seeing this  its awfulit isnt cool the dialogue is awful theres way too many cameos its awkwardly directed it doesnt gel or flow it at best mimics the style of martial arts films it has no charmafter an hour i ceased to take it in it takes a really bad film to break my concentration but i found myself thinking this is really stupid i mean dumb its a big dumb filmnow i did enjoy tarantinos previous films but this is just a big selfindulgent mess its obvious he has nothing to say anymorei honestly felt id wasted 2 hours no emotional reaction apart from a resigned cry of pointless,cruel
despite the trend of violence depicted in this film which serves entertainment value vol 1 is a pathetic joke there is no comparison between this and quentin tarantinos previous work the reservoir dogs and pulp fiction this flick is utterly hollowthe story is about a heavily pregnant bride and assassin uma thurman who is severely tortured by her fellow assassins and gunned down by her boss and the childs father bill david carradine she survives the massacre all the wedding guests are killed falls into a coma and wakes up four years later the assassination squad originally decides to murder her while she is in a coma but the mission is later aborted because bill wants to maintain their reputation and begins her bloody revenge killing her onetime coworkers one by one here are some of the numerous loopholes in the filmthe bride awakes from her coma looks at her body in disbelief and murmurs four yearsfour years how on earth is she aware that it has been four years since she falls into a comashe lies on the floor behind the medical staff member who has been repeatedly raping her while she is in a coma and pulls out a knife and attacks the man how on earth does she still have a knife with her when she has been hospitalised for four years she is supposed to have nothing on her she leaves the hospital in her patients gown with the car of the attacked man while she is in a coma and later she arrives at the neighbourhood where vivica a foxs character lives with normal clothes how does she get them she then travels light extremely light with only a bag and buys a single ticket to okinawa where does she get the money after four years of being isolated from the outside world is her bank account still valid could she really have the money for a plane ticket to okinawa and another one to tokyothere are scenes in which she is on the aeroplane with her sword is it ever possible that she is allowed to carry a sword onto a planeyou may find the action bit dazzling but this is what i call pulp fiction you may find this movie experimental but i find it a failed attempt of tarantinos the flashbacks is nothing new i dont see any original creative or profound meaning in this film,cruel
to me this movie seemed to be more of a comedy than an actionthriller the bride survives a point blank gun shot to the head andspends months in a coma and then when she comes out of thecoma after 13 hours is able to walk and drive then flies tookinawa and demands a sword from a master sword maker andafter one month of practice with the blade is able to take on thechinese mob and 88 master swordsmen with this one sword andwin i dont think so also the blood spray from the wounds aremore in line with what you would see in a japanese cartoon not inreal lifei did enjoy the movie as a comedy but as an actionadventure film i found it sadly lacking i thought that as a whole thismovie was lacking any real suspense and was quite predictablethe action itself was good although unbelievable i would have liketo see more sword play  between the bride and oren because iknow that  lucy liu can handle a sword like the best of them and itwould have been a more exciting finish to it,cruel
quentin tarantino is one of our times most gifted directorsscriptwriters and obviously also one of the most childish vol 1 is not as much a movie as it is a mishmash of older cooler martialarts and samurai movies from the 70s the story is simple and can be summarized in one word revenge in fact the whole movie can be summarized in one word copyuma thurman plays the woman whos craving revenge and a pretty bloody one too the first scenes are actually crap really some of the worst dialog in a tarantino movie ever is spoken and a dull fight takes place the good thing is that the movie doesnt get worse from here but it doesnt improve much either the only thing that ill remember for some time is the gruesome anime sequence otherwise the movie is just scene after scene thats been stolen somewhere been made to look a bit prettier but actually also to work much worse uma thurman is just not very good at handling a sword and the surreal atmosphere is more strange than anything else i know that tarantino really loves samurai movies but he could have made a real movie instead of making two inferior commercials about themall in all this is one of the most overrated movies ever and i think its more that people want to stay loyal to tarantino than anything else510,cruel
vol 1 at its heart is really a simple tale of a wannabe murder gone wrong and the revenge that courses through the intended victim however in quentin tarantinos hands is an overblown blood festuma thurman plays the bride who is also known as black mambo she was a part of an elite killing squad with 4 other adept assassins played by vivica a fox darryl hannah michael madsen and lucy liu these five killers are headed up by bill whose face we never see in the movie for some unexplained reason bill and his four killers set out to murder a very pregnant black mambo on her wedding day they torture and kill black mambo and her unborn childso they think black mambothe bride awakens from a four year coma with revenge killing on her mind the movie switches back from the distant past to the recent past and to the present at lightening speed without making much of a cohesive plot the flick is filled with quentin tarantino esque pop culture references and pseudophilosophical speeches from his characters the only thing lacking in the dialogue is his normal excessive usage of the word ngervol 1 is an ostentatious homage to the 1950s japanese samurai the 1970s kung fu and the late 80searly 90s hong kong action movies i even suspect that lucy lius characters name oren ishii is a homage to the rap group nwa o standing for the first letter in ice cubes real name oshay ren for the deejay of nwa and ishi sounds a lot like eazye i give the movie four stars out of ten for the plot twist at the end the excellent swordplay and the wutang clans rzas spoton original scores,cruel
it is expected that this film would be violent but the plot was not as good as pulp fiction or other films by the same director uma thurman did a good job in her role but the action was a bit over the top there was certainly a strong kung fu influence on this movie and many of the fight sequences reminded me of old bruce lee movies except blood covered every scene if you love blood  guts and love to see blood  guts in every scene then this film is for you if you thought there would be a great storyline then you might be disappointed doubt i will watch vol 2 since it is apparent from the first volume what will happen in the sequel i will have to admit lucy lu was fabulous in her role,cruel
let me preface my comments with the following qualification i have very high standards when it comes to movies and quentin tarantino has consistently failed to meet themthis film was no exception and is in my opinion his worst ever pulp fiction had the novelty factor going for it now that the genre is established one has to fall back on plot and entertainment valuevol 1 has neither plot nor entertainment value im sure this was some attempt on the part of tarantino to salute a classic genre which is equally low quality but manages to underachieve on a fraction of the budget bgrade kungfu filmswhen youre in college and youre broadening your horizons watching bgrade kungfu movies is a requisite activity after you leave college however you realize that your trappings of irony such as listening to they might be giants and watching b movies is just that  trappings of ironytarantino would have done well to leave his trappings in college but thanks to hollywoods propensity for beating then fellating a dead horse we have all had this insufferable piece of feces inflicted upon usinteresting cinematic genre blending and special effects do little to add to a film that has no plot and blood that sprays out of peoples necks and arms like its being pumped by a hose if you enjoyed army of darkness this film is for you my friend for those of us with taste dont waste your time,cruel
after hearing so much i rented this with high expectations a la pulp fiction and reservoir dogsanyway ive read some the other reviews and it seems its all been said so i will be briefquentin grow the hell up and you will be the best director alive today better than speilberg coppola jonze etc you have skill vision abilitybut as long as you feel the need to show us blood blood and grotesque crap that reaks of 19 year old fun for all you will be relegated to george romero status and be written off by history as any other action bloody directorthis movie stunk bit couldve been great without the spurting blood and brain scenes oh and the little girl witnessing moms incidentyou are a jackass,cruel
i saw this last night and am glad i only rented it i think tarantino is a hack and a thief dont get me wrong i liked resevoir dogs and the first half of that vampire movie but pulp fiction and this were crap to menow i know i know there are legion who think this man is a genius for taking anime to its next level and making us pay twice for it and there may be something to that for my part i can only see quentin salivating over scene after scene where two hotties battle each other in high naughty school girl film attire the violence was punctuated by scenes more unnecessary than any segue from a modern stephen king novel to me this movie looks like someone loaned 14000000000 and forty hot woman to a bunch of anime geeks with oxicream still on their noses and they shot this crap,cruel
this is a horrible movie if the intention of the producer of the movie was to provide entertainment for psychopaths then he did  a good job of it i have seen many action flicks that have gratuitous violence but at least the hero has some redeeming qualities that makes them likable the hero an assassin is just as evil as the other assassins she is hunting down this movie is no better than watching an ultra violent video game entertaining if you are the one fiddling around with the paddles making the character move on the screen but not if you are watching it watching 5 minutes of the worst jackie chan flick is more interesting than watching 1 minute of i paid good money to watch this flick and regret it i want my money back,cruel
look guysi am open minded as most folk i watch a lot of movies and can recognize a good movie i guess that makes qualified to spot a stinker too 1 and 2 should be killed asap what a bunch of crap i just do not see what the fuss is about these two movies are utter crap and i am sorry i went to see the second one thank god i was invited so i did not lose the price of the ticket i am utterly amazed that people call these movies art etcbunch of crap watch the weather channel if you have no other choice sorryi am just flabbergasted at this junk i am still amazed at all the glowing reviewspeople go get a life,cruel
people would be laughing it off of the screeni couldnt tell the difference between this movie and ecks vs severe maybe if id never seen a movie before or wasnt distracted by tarantino referencing himself plenty of good ideas but strung out through a pretty boring story about characters i couldnt care less for theres plenty of action but eventually it becomes too much and anything interesting that might be happening in the combat sequences is swallowed up by the ridiculous length of the scenes it could have used some very heavy editing but tarantinos name carries too much weight and like lucass episodes one and two nobody seems to have been able to convince him to make the cuts its still hip to love the qt though eh id like my money back sir,cruel
i looked forward to viewing this film as i had heard so many positive comments tarantinos best effort better than pulp fiction on and on they went soooo i rented it and was i disappointed look i absolutely loved pulp fiction and reservoir dogs so i was stoked for a real winner and what i got was a so so film i still dont get all the blood spewing like a fire hydrant even in the cheesy karate flicks this is supposedly paying homage to the special effects werent that exaggerated i guess ill see volume ii just so i know how it ends even though it is painfully obvious when quentin latches on to something it seems he is possessed to the extreme and it shows up big time in this film look for the red apple cigarettes and uma jolting up from a coma nice references to pulp,cruel
before i start my actual review of vol1 i have to tell you a little bit about my history with tarantinothe first one i saw was reservoir dogs a lot of people say its packed with references to other movies but i can only think of two or three off the top of my head reservoir dogs is also my favorite tarantino movie pulp fiction is obviously packed with loads of film references that worked though and i liked it jackie brown came next which was mostly just a tribute to blaxploitation movies i liked that too but less than the othersbut now with the first installment of tarantinos weakness is starting to show he cant write anything original i mean some people take influence from other scenes in films for instance the famous mirror scene in welles lady from shanghai was first seen in chaplins the circus obviously they are not the same scene although they both take place in a hall of mirrors area shamelessly lifts other scenes from movies the most obvious and blatant reference is seen when the bride gets in to the pussy wagon and starts saying wiggle your big toe where did that come from why john fords on the wings of eagles of course then theres the butchered morricone spaghettiwestern music a line lifted directly from a leone moviehe should have killed ten and many other scenes and things lifted from different grindhousejapanese action movies im just sick of it i want to see tarantino writing his own material and stop paying homage to other moviesahh but there are other flaws in the film a very boring and linear plot doesnt help uma thurmans not a great actress and many of the characters are very boring bill is the only character i really want to see more of in part 2 considering his mystery and that hes played by david carradineon the other hand the action scenes are splendid theyre quite well choreographed and very exciting the battle with the crazy 88s stands out i was also pleased by the anime sequencealthough honktasticwell i hope pt2 is better because i was dissapointed410,cruel
alrightthis movie is a pile of ostrich excrement  okay there is like one story here but it never goes anywhere  is it me  all my friends thought this was like the next star wars or somethingi think its just a pointless flick with a ton of violence  i like stuff like that but there has to be a point behind it  there is none of that here  there is nothing to hold your interest whatsoevertrash  i hear all these amazing things about tarentino then i go see this and i really feel like i have the wrong guy  but if you enjoyed it i highly recommend movies like judge dredd and red scorpionjust as amazing as this,cruel
i saw this movie when it was in theatres and wondered why on earth anyone would spend money and put out such an effort to make such a piece of crap a friend recently told me it was in the imdb top 250 and i was surprised now that ive looked and ive seen that is so high in the list i have to say it one more time  what a piece of crapi have previously greatly enjoyed qt movies  pulp fiction is certainly one of my favourite movies  it was an infusion of several different simultaneous plots into an entertaining solid and complete movie  i cant say any of these things about v1  it is a vengeance movie with nothing more than a lot of fighting a lot of blood and no reason to give a damn about anyone in the movie  i could care less about the characters portrayed by uma lucy or vivica  yes theyre all hot but thats not enough for a whole movieunless someone offers to buy all my popcorn drinks a hot dog some licorice a box of milk duds and pay for the ticket i wont be seeing part 2 in the theatre  if they do buy all that stuff at least ill be so full ill likely fall asleep,cruel
was there a cooler film in 2003 than  i dont think there was has all the elements of what a good time at the movies is all about  the way a director stays fresh and interesting is to continue to broaden hisher horizons not rehash the same thing theyve done three times before  let me point out some of strong points and then some weak ones in my eyes  while this picture may not have captured the exact way of the samurai it did show what revenge is capable of  i would like to remind people that no one waits for the other person to attack anymore theres no such thing as a fair fight so honor is right out of the window and the bride had all the motivation in the world for what happened to her so her fight at the house of blue leaves was justifiably violent and unmerciful  sword fights arent tennis matches  they can be permanently fatal  all the actors established a character very well and how great was the anime sequence  is not trying to be anything its trying to remind people of a type of film that has been forgotten  its a love affair of tarantinos just like uma is to him  and it shows  there are plot holes in the first such as her sitting in the pussy wagon for 13 hours while no police or medical staff from the hospital check the dead mans car when they see his keys missing  and i would also say the catchy dialouge tarantino was known for is fading as it wasnt too strong in this film but there are some things i would like to be explained in the 2nd film and i wait in anticipation for them  this is what going to the theaters is all about,cruel
spoilers is the fourth film by quentin tarantino  in case you were unaware of this vital fact the opening credits include the legend the fourth film by quentin tarantino  this is a trend that needs to be nipped in the bud right now  the heart sinks at the thought of reading the thirtyninth film by steven spielberg or the twentieth film by ron howard or especially the second film by stephen fry quentin tarantinos fourth fulllength feature film is only half a film its full title is vol 1  at least its not episode one attack of the kung fu fighting babes the special edition tarantino after hectoring from his producers decided to split his epic action movie into two parts thus enabling his beloved fans to appreciate fully the fruits of his artistic genius without having to nip to the toilet halfway through  they probably did us all a favour one threehour movie consisting of nothing but fighting and sassy dialogue  hard work  two ninetyminute movies consisting of nothing but fighting and sassy dialogue a walk in the park  two walks in the park tarantino after the mature ie dull jackie brown the third film by quentin tarantino has decided to play to his strengths here  so we get lots of violence and great music and widescreen closeups and brilliant action but not so many celebrity cameos or people sitting around talking and smoking dope  despite all the critical praise that was heaped on him for jackie brown its clear that that film saw him working on autopilot cruising along happily enough with all his showbiz chums  its not a film that anyone needs to see more than once  unlike reservoir dogs the first film by quentin tarantino which demands repeat viewings and works its magic on you like a drug  that film remains his finest moment no matter what the academy or anyone else said about pulp fiction the second film by quentin tarantino   true it was pulp fiction that cemented the mans reputation as a purveyor of brilliantlymade hysterical bmovies but reservoir dogs is more than just a lurid heist thriller it would have been interesting to see tarantino develop in the noir directions it hinted at rather than giving in to his basic instincts stepping on the gas shaking the ketchup bottle and piling up the popculture references until were all blue in the face  and while jackie brown was praised for its maturity at least one viewer found it interminably and unforgivably lacklustreso we can be forgiven for approaching vol 1 with some trepidation early signs are not good injoke references to old movies our feature presentation shaw scope fail to raise a smile  as the man himself might say hardifkinhar and then uma thurman draws a square in the air with her finger and the square doesnt appear on screen thus immediately banishing all memories of that hideous moment in pulp fiction when it does indeed for all its wild and crazy action this is a surprisingly traditional and oldfashioned film  there are no computergenerated effects  there are none of the ludicrous and clichd fights that we have become so used to over recent years  what we get instead is blood sweat and tears  people fight and get injured and exhausted and some of them quite a lot of them actually even die  blood spurts all over the place  but there also startlingly beautiful moments of silence amid the carnage such as the snowbound nighttime shot of uma and lucy facing off in the garden as a water clock tips over and clicks back into place  like a peasant in a bruegel painting it takes centre stage while momentous events happen in the background but never mind all that  what about the plot  what actually happens in this movie welluma has been treated badly beaten up shot in the head that sort of thing but somehow is still alive  waking from her coma she swears revenge she gets a guy to make her a sword and then she goes to kill people not necessarily in that order  along the way there are a truly great cartoon flashback colourcoded subtitles why dont more films do this daryl hannah whistling and wearing an eyepatch and lucy liu getting scalped again not necessarily in that order and thats about it  yes i think we can honestly say that quentin has made going to the cinema fun again  its just a shame he had to split his film into two thus turning it into a saga and thus grouping it with all those other horrible portentous humourless endless sagas currently polluting the culture  let the geeks have their rings and potter and matrix retarded the rest of us can wallow in the guilty pleasure of a widescreen extravaganza that shows mr tarantino at the very top of his game  of course only a lunatic would want all movies to be like this one a bit of depth and subtlety is always welcome now and then  but in a time when so much hollywood mainstream product is artistically and imaginatively redundant it comes as a very pleasant surprise to find we need quentin tarantino more than ever,cruel
as with other tarantino films this one delights in spectacularmutilation particularly inviting the passive audience to enjoy thebrutal degradation of women i was repeatedly saddened by hiscruel closeups of uma thurmans beautiful face beaten for hisenjoyment and projected into our view tarantino has an evilvicious and vacuous destructive agenda and the sooner popmedia and culture realize this and ignores his blood filledfantasies of human destruction the better off  the future will be,cruel
good lord was i disappointed with this movie i had been waiting for months to see it and absolutely abhorred it almost from the first five minutes on all style no substance filled with ridiculous glitzy gimmicks and detours which ring as some of the most selfindulgent i have ever seen in film pulp fiction and reservoir dogs were great films but quentin tarantino was so high on himself making this picture it makes me sick and once you get through all the gimmicks its really a very boring movie i probably would have fallen asleep if it werent for the fantastic amounts of gore the cliffhanger at the end was pretty cool ill give it that at least good enough to make we come back and see volume ii but this movie was terrible i know im in the minority on this one but it was just utter crap crap crap crap crap crap peace110,cruel
quentin tarantino qt has a big interest for asian cinema his debut film reservoir dogs was influenced by ringo lams city on fire bruce willis wields a samurai sword in the award winning pulp fiction and patricia arquette watches a better tomorrow 2 and street fighter in qts script to true romance with kb qts fourth feature film he sets all eyes on the asian school of filmmaking in kb qt sums up all things in he likes about chop socky films from the 7080s and adds a small dose of spaghetti westerns and blaxploitation themes as well boy has he watched many films during his life time perhaps too many im afraidkb is about the female killer played by uma thurman waking up from a 4year coma after she was betrayed by her associates her task is to take revenge on them the deadly viper assassination squad and  especially  kill their leading mystery man bill hence the title the simple revenge story leaves much to be desired from a man of qts calibre since this he surely knows how to write stories and scripts but if we leave the main story aside and interpret it as homage to the typical action film genre where revenge often is a classic motif kb needs to rely on qts fantastic dialoguewriting but also this leaves me empty there are no classic and memorable lines like samuel l jacksons royale with cheesemonologue or nifty stories like the ones told in reservoir dogs his way of storytelling was so superior that it spawned a zillion qt wannabes most successful probably being guy ritchies gangster films made by and for pint heaving lads the coolness that once was qts trademark is gone well at least most of it because in the middle of this somewhat empty film are some highlights ill now present the pros and cons of this movie   uma thurman is a good cast her fine soft appearance contradicting the typical roughness and hardedged sterotype of an avenger here we have a real femme fatale in action although the character is as thin as paper she does a good job portraying this anonymous bride with no name her name is bleeped out for some reason hopefully revealed in kb vol2 the use of female characters is also welcome since worldwide action cinema needs female heroes to ascend from cheng pei pei in come drink with me through blaxploitation films from the 70s and all the way to carrieanne moss of the matrix fame also take note that apart from two killings in the film all of the bodycounts in kb is put up on the womens account judging on the brutal finale thats about a 90  2 lead for the gals this film is oozing with style the camera work is top notch at times there are split screens kung fuclose ups reversed timeline an animated section unrealistic stylizations of violence and homages to films galore which   at the same time makes the movie rather shallow yes i have also seen the lone wolf and cub series yes i know sonny chiba was a bad ass in street fighter yes i get the shaw brothers references yes ive seen a lot of anime in other words ive witnessed many films which in their original form was stylized and worked perfectly by its independent self what kb does is that it takes steals borrows or any verb of your choice all those neat little details or trademarks from those films and goes over the top to a point where you grow tired of the so obvious references that you yearn for something original instead of a homage the most relevant film in kbs case is lone wolf and cub or lightning swords of death or shogun assassin or whichever version you prefer the spectacular but somewhat overlong finale of kb echoes the massive slaughterhouse endings of several hong kong action movies and has uma thurman  dressed in bruce lees yellow track suit from game of death ho ho ho another neat reference i hear the 13yearold pimple faced action nerd chuckle  battling off the crazy 88 basically a bunch of mad japanese killers hired to protect lucy luis character in a manner reminiscent of the lone wolf and cub series in those movies violence was extreme blood spurted like water from a fire extinguishing hose and limbs were easily dismembered by razor sharp swords kb is not original in that sense qt just want to do a film that looks like those cult genre movies he and therefore indirectly also his fans has been watching himself for years too bad it just falls flat like his friend robert rodriguez from dusk till dawn  another shot at doing a crossover genre film with a high quality cast another trademark of qt is his choice of music in his films but really havent we grown tired of this cool hip surfrock n rollfunk music in his productions even the usage of an edited short version of the human beinz classic garage song nobody but me seem extremely misplaced in the context of a ferocious sword battle and the rzas original music is at times uneven too take for instance the climax battle between lui and thurman where theold wu tang clansman uses a spaghetti western style song another homage off course to minimal effect that scene would profit from no music at all the violence in kb is extreme by western standards this is explicitly marked out for the viewers when the huge sword battle suddenly turns black and white as an eyeball is ripped out of its socket sonny chiba style this may not only tone down the colors of gore on screen but also have a certain style effect in asia however the scene is in full color obviously the asian audience have got the stomach for that sort of thing sometimes the violence is comical sometimes its stylized and sometimes its downright dumb and we dont really need that stupiditythe intent of kb surely has to be to pay a tribute to an inspiring movie scene that in the last couple of years has influenced the hollywood way of making action films i bet qt wants you to buyrent the real deal after seeing kb its a shame though that the real deal is much better than kb and its quite a mystery that a master screenwriter like qt doesnt have the talent to fill a movie with a decent script and originality what kb is at the moment is more like a late night pizza kinda movie and is that really what we wanted or expected from qt is this the same person that won a palme dor some years agorating 4  10,cruel
i have been a fan of quentin tarantino since i first saw reservoir dogs  ive been a martial arts fan for over 25 years  this movie had both but it stunk  you can always expect there to be a few cheesy moments in every tarantino film  usually it works  this time it didnt  the cheese ruined this film  the main characters all had ridiculous nicknames  no one in this film just bledif someone was cut they gushed blood like a geyser or like the black knight in monty python and the holy grail  lastly the soundtrack and sound effects were irritating and way too loud though this might have partly been due to a hearing impaired projector operator in my local theater      had a couple of things going for it however  the action in the fight scenes were brilliantly choreographed  if youre going to see this movie just for the action go ahead  you might enjoy it if you can get past all the cartoon violence  the other thing worth watching in this film was martial arts film veteran sonny chiba  he only spent 5 to 10 minutes on the screen if that but he was very enjoyable to watch  like christian slater claimed in true romance hes the finest actor in martial arts films today  unfortunately though we didnt get to see him in action when they talked about splitting into 2 separate movies i was upset that id have to wait several months to see how it ends  im not so worried about that now  ill wait till volume 2 comes on cable  the only way ill go see it at the movie theater is if tarantino reshoots the ending to have sonny chiba team up with uma thurmans character against bill david carradine,cruel
tarantinos latest movie is pure crap should we blame the relentless americanization of culture or simply tarantinos burnout martial arts are neither martial nor arts anymore just a big boring and sickening rambolike grand guignol ironically when american directors realised that bullets killed too fast they resorted to jujitsu karate and japanese swords and strung out the killing thing the sheer silliness of yakuza hitmen using a katana instead of guns or of a chineseamerican woman as their godfather do not seem to bother tarantino what really matters is chopping off as many heads and limbs as possible and disembowel a fair amount of people the underlying philosophy of martial arts is completely lost but the schwarzeneggerian nature of modern politics is finely exposed shameless gratuitous violence and bloodshed i am ashamed of those 20 people or so who applauded while i am glad nobody else in the theatre followed their example outrageous is that tarantino claimed he took inspiration from sergio leone a remarkable italian director who by now must be spinning in his grave with shame and embarrassment but after all you know it was ironic im actually still laughingahahahahahahahahahahahahahstrawberries in the supermarket by emir kusturica thats irony,cruel
what a mess once the bride grabs her flight to japan i suggest you unfasten your seatbelt feel free to walk about the cabin and right out of the theater vol1 is a batman  robin version of the great films of asian cinema honor the originals and like tarantino enjoy them first hand,cruel
im a big fan of tarantinos movies reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were masterpieces and jackie brown to a lesser extent was still an enjoyable flick  so it was with great disappointment that i was presented with his latest offering in the form of  after all the hype it was always going to be difficult for this movie to live up to expectations but in the end it didnt come closethe single most accurate word to describe would be pointless whereas pulp fiction was interesting on more than just a visual and stylistic level does not venture past being a violent movie for violences sake  it is style above substance and violence without a point to it  the characters are drastically underdeveloped dont take this to mean that the acting is bad as it is not and the audience is not really led to identify with the characters in any waythe movie whilst being visually splendid relies far too heavily on the fact that it is a tarantino film to gain the critics applause rather than concentrating on developing an interesting and compelling story as was best achieved in pulp fiction of course you will not find a critic who will stand up and expose the film for what it really is  a senseless portrayal of violence  for fear of not understanding tarantinos underlying message or what have you  on that front all i have to say is that after several years of studying film the only point of relevance makes is in exposing the level to which society has become accustomed to violence the audience in the cinema laughed out loud at the sight of people getting their limbs severed and screaming in agonyyes hilariousanother point i would make is that the inclusion of a tacky pokemonesque sequence does not make tarantino an artistic genius  it is pure selfindulgent pretentiousness that tries to further the myth that if you dont get it youre somehow not intelligent enough to enjoy tarantinos genius pure rubbish it is quite simply a gimmick employed by someone who obviously considers himself to be an artisteof course having read this and if youve got this far i thank you it may be argued that i simply dont get this type of film  to that i would say that violence in context is one thing and i can accept that as valid but violence as an entire movie is quite another  this is where and the rest of tarantinos films differlet me clarify  there is nothing wrong with this film  it will be enjoyed by those who want to see mindless violence and thats fair enough but it is not a masterpiece by any means and the tarantino label cannot change that  410 purely for its visual aspects which it rips off from crouching tiger and some inventive cinematography,cruel
fast mood art knocked on the door of the movie industry from the great hollywood for one more time to mutilate everything valuable that the great film masters have done since the beginning of the last century it is cozier to watch a movie than to read a book so is cozier to watch tarantinos filmed juvenile comic book than to watch a real film this is how the soulfood industry for mediocre masses has replaced the film industry and by that masshysteria controls manipulate and hypnotizes the movie lovers all over the globe block the brain and youll see the golden rain sad face of the talented director who made such epics as pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but nothing valuable after that money and pretty sick ego became his priority in this film he is convinced that he is at least equal to sergio leone so he introduced jackie chan to clint eastwood which requires iq of 40 or lower to love this poor and shallow filming one more thing stupid movies get pretty poor grades but if you make something incredibly stupid and by that even try to beat the most stupid movies ever made you get the highest praises from the masses interesting topic for social science studies and maybe even psychiatric survey,cruel
the best of all quentin tarantinos movies vol1 is exciting and a breath taking uma thurman is excellent as the bride who goes after her revengeand i think it was totally worthwhile that quentin tarantino delayed the start of the production because uma thurman was pregnantbecause i cannot see other actress to be in her placethe fights the bloodthe swords the japanese culture the anime scenesare all so nice that you doesnt want to stop watching this movie for a minute i loved the character go go yubari to see again tarantino brands red apple cigarettes and the great actresses like vivica a foxdaryl hannahlucy liu among others who works in this moviethe plot we see a bride who wants her revenge with her ex partners from deadly viper assassination squad since they all tried to kill herher husband and her baby bill never really shows his face in this movie and the brides name is never told because we need to see her only as a killersince her story is not told yetinteresting fact the members of the deadly viper assassination squad are all named for snakes sidewinder black mamba cottonmouth copperhead and california mountain king snake black mamba is the most poisonous oneaka volume 1  brazil,cruel
lets imagine tarantino holidaying in italy and remaking la dolce vita well this is how i see choose the right soundtrack steal the clothes from bruce lee and redo a kurosawa i wish that happens to be very close to the lone wolf series with all the same gore effects a 5 minutes plot with a lot of blood surely the cartoon and the fight series could have been shortened just over 1 hour 30 mins so that there would be no need for a number 2 but money is money and tarantino makes more money throwing on to the market a double bill hurrah lets all be ripped off looking forward to la dolce vita tarantino way now surely a masterpiece,cruel
this movie was terrible it was comparable to slow painful torture i would have cried out in pain but i was too busy vomiting uncontrollably a merciful god would have exploded my eyes and hopefully i would have drowned in a like blood squirt this movie should be used as an antidrug commerical this is what happens when you are high you create a terrible movie and ruin your reputation i was surprised to learn that this movie had a script i naturally assumed that this movie was written a monkey with brain damage who had both arms cut off and had to type it by slamming his head on the keyboard clearly this movie was the result of a collaboration of sadistic free masons who enjoy the sick pleasure of enducing pain on others a movie like this physically took 5 years off my life the only type of person who could possibly have found anything good out of this must have an iq of 30 or less possibly the equivalent of a toaster oven the only possible explanation for a movie so horrible is that some guy walking down the street saw a sale on camcorders at kmart and decided to start filming one of the worst movies of all time,cruel
now let me get this straight if you throw in enough references to other films even shlocky films your audience will think theyre seeing true art doesnt matter thats its 90 minutes of numbing desensitizing dismemberments people in this film dont have emotional reactions they dont have to theyre in a comic book  the mind of quentin tarantino  the anime influenced nerd with style you like this stuff the japanese did it for real at nanking in 1938 played decapitation games with the chinese civilians isnt that amusing it cannot be argued any longer that tarantino doesnt just throw in spatter for shock value or that he has now run out of headroom in reservior dogs it was just an ear and plenty of shooting  now its just nonstop carnage without plot dialogue or character,cruel
utter rubbish the plot from the beginning was senseless as for the ninja scene that was just ridiculous almost laughable if it wasnt so boring the blood and gore was meaningless and wouldnt fool a child this film lacks any style not a film that tarantino should mention in his cvbruce lee must be turning in his grave over this farcical movie go watch enter the dragon or a jackie chan film for a real martial arts movie is a poor imitation well to make up the full ten lines that this film dosent deserve all i will say is dont watch this film or any of the sequels go paint the spare room and watch it dry its more entertaining,cruel
in texas on the day of her wedding the pregnant bride uma thurman is shot in the head by her former boss bill his squad of international assassins slaughters all the persons present in the church the reasons are not explained in the story but the bride actually did not die and stays in coma for four years when she wakesup she looks for payback and prepares a list of persons that must die the first one to be killed is oren ishii lucy liu and then vernita green vivica a fox  the story a salad of steven segals hard to kill karate kid ang lees crouching tiger hidden dragon and many other films has so many blood as freddy vs jason but is a great entertainment with lots of action and black humor the screenplay is very original and violent a trademark of quentin tarentino the story is presented in a nonchronological way and the reasons of the massacre have not been presented yet in brazil only last week vol 1 was released in the movie theaters i saw it in an imported dvd and i really liked it my vote is ninetitle brazil ,cruel
ok lets just startoff with my saying that i am not a huge tarantino fan at all  pulp fiction is interesting for me because of the way he tells that story oh and sam jacksonhes the man and i actually liked jackie brown more than pulp fiction  i had no desire whatsoever to see  at all  it was much worse than i expected  heres the basic premise umas family is murdered on her wedding day and she miraculously survives a bullet to the brain then she makes a hitlist and goes after those who tortured her and left her for dead  thats it  so to say theres a lot of killing in this movie is a severe understatement  oh and if you have a phobia for blood or dismemberment do yourself a favor and keep away from this movie  very far away  i cant understand why anyone would actually like this movie sure there are some cool stunts and choreography with the fights but even that dulls after five minutes honestly  for me it was simply excessively violent for the sake of being excessively violent and possessed no redeeming qualities  at all,cruel
spoiler alert sorry wrong movie anyway after watching volume i quentin tarantinos latest smashing entrance into the otherwise relatively boring modern cineplexes ive decided on a new paint job for my truck and by that of course i mean i dont own a car or a truck but if i did i would certainly paint it every hideous color imaginable including a phrase on the tailgate which would quickly and efficiently negate even the slightest possibility of ever obtaining exactly that which it describesthe shaggin wagon as ill refer to it for the benefit of all of you under17 imdb readers is one of the first of almost two full hours of similarly hilarious images words scenes characters etc brought to us by quentin tarantino one of the most effectively humorous yet characteristically violent filmmakers working today tarantino has a surprisingly deep understanding of the gravity of violence but he combines that with the equal depth of his understanding of his audience hence the violence in the movie is nothing like violence in real life ill explain this theoretical connection in a minute people know this especially his audience which renders his films so effectivetarantinos understanding of his audience is one of the things that has allowed him to develop such a dedicated following which i think transcends cultstatus by its sheer size if nothing else has the curious distinction of being brutally and pretty much endlessly violent and yet you cant really say that its too violent given that so much of the violence is so cartoonish sometimes literally ive heard that there was something like 100 gallons of fake blood used to make the movie i cant remember if this refers to the total amount of blood used during filming or only that which ended up in the final cut but animated blood of which there are substantial amounts are surely not includedand either way despite the massive amounts of violence in the movie tarantinos unique style of direction his various cinematic experiments such as flipping from color to black and white and back again playing with lighting and color as in the fight scene on an entirely blue background where only the fighters silhouettes were visible and of course the music and probably mostly of all his sense of humor tower above the film from beginning to end one of my favorite tricks that he pulls with the music is in the fight scene between the bride and oren ishii it takes place in an exquisite japanese garden and just as the fighting begins the flamenco music kicks in strikingly out of place but strangely effective tarantinos influence is so prevalent throughout the whole movie that not only can you sense his presence in just about every scene in the movie you can almost see the look on his faceits important to keep in mind however that despite knowing how effective an unexpected mixture of violence and humor can be tarantino also realizes how effective real violence can be and he knows how to make his violence effective disturbing even stomachturning see reservoir dogs the part of the movie where the bride wakes up in the hospital for example and realizes that she has lost her baby is not funny at all this is not meant to be amusing or funny this is the scene where the bride develops a large part of the rage that drives her for the rest of the film if it was made a joke and i cant really see how ever tarantino could have made something like that even slightly amusing the rest of the movie would have fallen flatthe movie itself when you think about it is really little more than a setup of deception and subsequent revenge its a pretty unusual setup in that the seeker of the revenge has a distinct advantage of the element of surprise given that the people sought out for revenge shot her or saw her shot in the head and so havent even the slightest inclination that she might be alive but the movie boils down to a decidedly simple and linear revenge plot tarantino knows this too you might have noticed that first of all the bride carried with her a list in a little notebook of the people she means to kill which reminded me in a slightly different way of the list that steve buscemis character kept in his small part in billy madison but also that in keeping with his style tarantino plays with the chronology of his plot hes known for this but a movie that boils down to something as simple as this one does really cant do with a plot told in chronological orderin her previous life the one that contained something other than blinding rage and absolute determination for revenge the bride was a member of what is curiously called the deadly viper assassination squad the exact activities of which will not be clearly explained until part ii her code name was black mamba although at one point i wondered why it wasnt yellowhaired warrior and her real name evidently entails something so secretive that it would be bleeped out when spoken in the movielike most of tarantinos movies plays like a compilation of all of the things that he loves about a huge array of different kinds of movies not the least of which in this case are martial arts movies and classic 70s exploitation films the extensive homage to martial arts films plays no small part in the preceding storyline that results in the bride being an expert with a sword the weapons are in fact one of the more interesting parts of the movie especially in a scene late in the film where she fights the teenage bodyguard of oren ishii lucy liu who fights her with a medieval mace and chain i thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie where this young girl  by using everything from her feet to her hands to her very neck to propel that mace at the bride  proves that she is just about as good with that mace as the bride is with the sword if not betterkeep your eye out for sneaky cinematic tricks that tarantino pulls in his movies not necessarily things like animating a sequence that involves a little girl witnessing his parents murders and then a pedophilia scene involving that same girl at the age of 11 both of which would have earned the film an even harsher rating than the welldeserved r but things like the fact that the outfit that the bride wears is identical to the outfit that bruce lee wore in his last film or even better roger ebert points out that that tune that hannah was whistling as she walked through the halls of the hospital to provide her own bit of nursing to the bride while shes stuck in a coma is the theme from the 1968 film twisted nerve clearly tarantino once again placing an homage to an old favorite in one of his movies but ebert curiously notes that it is not meant to simply pay an homage but to suggest that there are leaks between parallel universes in which movies reside pretty clever idea if not entirely founded on the other hand ebert also suggested that after hattori hanso made the bride her sword breaking an almost 30 year old pact he had made to never again create an instrument of death his statement this my finest sword if in your journey you should encounter god god will be cut was not exactly his most modest hour so he could also be completely off about the movie universes thing hanso was not bragging about how badass his sword was he feared that god would be cut by hansos breaking his word i was surprised roger missed that one god doesnt strike me as the kind of person to worry about getting cut by an angry woman with a sword thats stuff for mere mortals to concern themselves with,cruel
omg there really isnt enough words in the english language to describe what nonsensical absolutely ridiculous excrement this flick iswhat a waste of filmit makes no sense for the most part people get various body parts sliced off and spray like sprinklersabsolutely ridiculous if i had paid to see this at a theatre id be demanding my money back and barracading myself in till they coughed upmaking somebody watch this film over and over would be my idea of a horrible torture,cruel
yeah so last night i saw volume 1 for the first time i just dont knowas far as mindless fun goes is entertaining it is fun to watch and yet i cant help but feel disappointed and cheated this movie doesnt live up to the expectations set by quentin tarantinos past work nor does is it deserving of all the critical acclaim that it has garnered as i write this volume 1 is 90 on the uservoted imdbcom top 250 films list is certainly not one of the best 250 films ever madeis very lacking in plot to the point where its insulting uma thurmans character the bride awakes from a coma and then kills two people and escapes from hospital room despite having severely atrophied muscles she gets to the parking lot where she sits in a stolen car for an indeterminate but decidedly exorbinant amount of time then theres an idiotic scene where she tries to urge her atrophied toe muscles to move by yelling at them in a brilliant directorial decision by mr tarantino the camera then zooms in on her feet somehow she doesnt get arrested in all this time that shes sitting there i guess she must have killed the only guy who worked at that hospital since apparently no one called the cops on her equally questionable is her ability to travel at will despite having no discernable source of income and no id im sorry but without id youre not purchasing airline tickets in post911 americaone of the biggest faults of the movie is that it is hard to empathize with the bride yeah her entire wedding party was killed and she was in a coma for 4 years maybe she deserved it in hard to kill you feel for steven seagal you learn more about the two members of bills deadly viper assassination squad that the bride kills than you do about her in that regard you empathize more with them especially lucy lius characterperhaps the most badly done part of the movie is the soundtrack it is just terrible in some scenes there is an obnoxious siren effect when the bride encounters danger almost every standout scene in the movie has pretty bad music the first scene with daryl hannahs character stands out in this regard as wellits hard to understand tarantinos goals with the movie unquestionably draws from 1970s kung fu movies and 1980s action movies but its hard to tell whether the movie is paying tribute or merely a parody the acting and the dialogue are both pretty abyssmal but not hilariously so none of the actors ham it up in fact theyre all quite wooden which i guess their equivalent of attempting serious acting keanu reeves looks like shakespeare in comparison the use of old school gore effects is also questionable if you watch a 1970s movie using the spraying blood effect that tarantino overuses in kb it seems silly and trite but if you watch an old movie using the same effect when that effect was state of the art and the film quality was much grainier youre able to reasonably suspend disbelief the best way to pay tribute to old kung fu movies would be make a new movie that draws from them but brings them into the 21st century tarantino fails to do this the only thing tarantino has updated is the direction and his frenetic flashy direction is a definite lowpoint of the movie its quite apparent that this movie was a labor of love for tarantino but his cinematography is quite detrimental to the movie it was obviously meant to be artistic but it comes off as pretenious banal and sometimes laughoutloud funny the movie plays like anime and bad anime at that good anime develops a compelling indepth plot involving complex relationships that justifies the excessive gore we are shown the fact that anime is animated also makes ludicrous gore seem less funny theres an inherent level of surreality in animation lacks thisas a whole doesnt add up the parts dont fit together well enough and something about the movie just feels disingenuous as an action movie fan i was let down there is nothing about this movie that gives an edge over the movies it emulates at best stands on par with old school action movies and im not convinced that it does that theres a level of intensity present in a rambo movie or an old jackie chan movie or a lethal weapon or a schwarzenegger movie or even a good seagal movie that just isnt there in final thoughts on tarantino your first three films are classic this is not stick with what youre good atfinal thoughts on its entertaining enough but not better than what came before in any way shape or form if you want a good postcoma revenge story watch hard to kill if you want copious violence watch commando or first blood part ii those two movies are straightforward action romps devoid of the forced pretentions of one good thing that does is that it doesnt intentionally pander to the popcorn crowd tarantino is definitely trying here but he falls shortfinal rating 32 out 5 starsslightly above average,cruel
this film belongs in the hideously bad cult category with artlessworks of self indulgence without any redeeming social value alongwith caligula and a few others the cartoonish style never risesabove crude adolescent scribbling with editing that makes it lookas though the director might have mixed methamphetamine inwith his acid tabs do we dare to condemn crimes against artyes,cruel
i just seen it yesterday what can i say just whoopsnot what i expected the movie kept me watching but i was not happy with the experience its just not tarantino anymore exhaustedlooking to the film in a very short note i can say 2 things the only good thing in this movie was uma thurman who was looking cool nice acting nice and fighting real and lucy liu  who was also a killer beauty in her own way   yet it looks like quentin totally exhausted himself lopoking to this serious piece of crap saying that he overdone wachowski is plain stupid matrix has a unique plot except part 3 well and there are no such moview at all more about plot later eye candy also much more nice in the matrix thank in and while i say that i am still a huge tarantino lover  its just not ol good tarantinopardon me tarantino lovers  i am too one of them but this film is an empty holei dont know   i heard that many people loved this film and said its tarantinos best but to me its just not right from all points of view1 being a tarantino film it almost lost tarantism there almost no humor in it no dark humor almost  but people vs me may say  come one its different genre its an action film it also lost twists  if we take a look of say reservoir dogs  also a bloody shotout film  it has so many angles to it so many interpretations here nothing dialogues  same  where the hell is tarantino almost every line of every tarantino film can be pronaunced over and over again and kept in the memory what here kill motherfers or what2 ok its an action film but what we see is just a lot of fights lot of blood thats it there is no plot almost you may repeat its a kung fu film and action film3the plot is flat to the bone she just out on revenge and have to kill everybody the film  even an action film and kung fu film should have a smarter plot in order to keep the smarter audience happy of cource all people who just want to see aslasher film without any meaning  go for it but its not me let see  i have seen several jet li movies or even if we say matrix actually i should take them separately matrix has a plot except maybe last and what a plot whoa most jackie chan movie have good plot van damme movie are a bit dumb but still have a plot i liked double team4 the art of action the whole brutal sequences are completely flat dull and not nice if we take back to jet lee movies movies like crounching tiger hidden dragon the hero etc  the whole samurai action looks like an art here we see stupid fight with equally stupid blood fontaining from bodies at a most stupid volume and speed finally if we really want to take a serious nice kung fusamurai action  take akira kurosava what a masterpiceces here we watch stupid and even though it was chareographed by matrix kung fu master  all scenes look stupid to me5 finally quentin tries to get to his role of finding artistic ways of capturing this whole s but to me its just doesnt make sense and doesnt get the effect the whole transitions of real cinema japanimation bw camera  to me they dont make this movie better in any wayso my score is 310 one point for keeping me awake sort of one point for being an likeanaverage action movie one point for being still a tarantino filmotherwise it would be 110so mach ado about nothing,cruel
in simplest terms this movie was garbage  i tried my hardest to even enjoy it but found myself bored to tears  face it peopleits a poorly assembled collection of trite recycled elements and not even done all that well  the matrix the original film mind you not its hohum sequels set a new standard in action films and this film flopsthe character development is nonexistent theres only the narrowest shred of a plot and the characters themselves are uninspiring caricatures of themselves the dialogues is stilted and ohsoawfully delivered that its painful to watch on top of all of that i cant find this style that everyone keeps harping aboutwhats so stylish about the random insertion of an anime segment that looks by the way about as classy as a high school kids doodle in the back of his math notebook a black and white segment or the silhouette fighting segment that is about as subtle as a tracheotomy  i found myself particularly annoyed by the plethora of hideous titles that continuously punctuate the film all of which look like they were generated using secondhand chracter generators manufactured in the late 1970s  just as an aside i dont think the same font was used twice  classy i tell youthe fact of the matter is that tarantino doesnt have the juice he needs to make this piece of detritus exciting in any other way  unfortunately he fails entirelyhis trite supposedly stylish effects come across as pompous and tediousthose who praise this filmfine theyre entitled to their own opinions but in all likelihood they are the same people who thought 2 fast 2 furious was high cinemanormally i make fun of movies that turn out to be bad but this made me wish that i was having my teeth pulled  i sure hope that it was intended to be a parody but the worst part is that i cant tell either way  its farcical elements are blatant and plentiful for instance the countless monty pythonesque sprays of blood do nothing but prompt the audience as to when to laugh hysterically  my gut feeling though tells me that tarantino sees this as the real thing  how sad for us allskip this film  its a waste  youd be better off renting something that actually manages to entertain at the same time,cruel
is a disappointment i first notice this film when uma thurman appeared in a magazine dressed yellow  black bruce lee wear a similar sport suit in one of his film  i am not a fan of 70s japanesehongkong action film but i thought making a movie either making fun of or paying homage to such a genre will be interesting however accomplish neither of themthe movie is even a bigger failure when viewed standalone because it has no plot the dialogue dry and all the characters got was only a nickname this movie might work if the actors believe in what they do but they dont vivica fox uma thurman and lucy liu all seems lost in their roles and i dont blame themthe fight between uma and lucy in the japanese garden is beautiful shot but that alone wont save the movie  there is some raw energy shown as expected in a tarantino film however raw energy without direction is really a waste of energy  i am sure tarantino enjoy making this movie because it is a fun movie to make too bad the movie isnt funny,cruel
this is without a doubt the worse movie i have seen in my entire life all the respect i have had for this man is gone please dont see it you dont want to do this to yourself i felt like asking for my money back afterwards but hey its not the theaters fault that i decided to torture myself,cruel
why why on earth would anyone want to waste a ridiculous amount of their life watching this film i hold out little faith for humanity when i see reviews of this film containing the word masterpiece please someone explain to me what redeeming features this film has when will people stop drinking the qt kool aid and see these films of his for what they truly are i have watched this film once i will never gain back the time i wasted on watching it and i regret my decision to even submit my eyes ears and brain to what this film claims to be this film had so many jump the shark moments that i dont want to list them for fear of spoiler reprisals but if you notice them like i did enjoy the utter farce behind them in short do not watch this film ever,cruel
in this film the first of two the bride betrayed and abandoned to die by her groom bill get her revenge route directed and written by quentin tarantino the film stars uma thurman and david carradinethis is a film that can be good but definitely is not for me i like some of tarantinos films but definitely i cannot understand this onethe performance of the actors is regular the special visual and sound effects are very good and the soundtrack given the circumstances is interesting the main problem of this film is the nonlinear narrative this option simply does not fit in the film and makes it more confusing than it would be in a conventional narrative its an artistic resource undoubtedly innovative but that should be used when not hinder the understanding of the public the public has to understand the movie and it does not happen here a person who knows nothing about this film which has never read anything about it dont understand it and discards itthe films screenplay is interesting although it has been virtually copied from another movie lady snowblood but despite the basic idea is good the bride betrayed by her groom abandoned and nearly murdered in his own marriage the way the film develops it is quite negative first of all the film doesnt explain bills reasons surely he didnt wake up that day with a sudden urge to kill the bride and this lack of rational explanation makes the situation farfetched another problem of this film is the illogical manner it displays and mixes raw action scenes western scenes or japanese scenes from a certain point the film seems made with pieces of film found in a garbage dump there is no logic in the way the film shows it,cruel
vol 1 is quentin tarantinos giddy homage to the movies he grew up withthe hong kong chopsockies the spaghetti westerns the yakuzasamurai actioners the japanese anime and the american blaxploitation flicks reshaped by the writerdirector as a sort of reverie of adolescent enthusiasms the plot has a directaction vividness suitable for a video game that walks a pretty straight path especially for a tarantino film cleverly constructed in five labeled chapters from the blood spattered bride to showdown at the house of blue leaves the movie expounds the tale of the bride uma thurman with the look of a chiseled humanoid in a physically arduous role whose rural el paso wedding is invaded by the deadly viper assassination squad and turned into a bloodbath leaving her trembling and bloodied four years later rising out of her comatose state she sets out on an unwavering mission to systematically eliminate her former cohorts one by one beginning with the now domesticized vernita green vivica a fox and the formidable oren ishii lucy liu before tracking down bill david carradine the eponymous focus of her vengeancefirmly in fanboy mode here tarantino prepares his revenge dish like a skilled chef chopping and tossing it in an astounding spectacle thats as alluring as the meal itself and because its tarantino the bloodletting is in full flow with heads severed and arms lopped off he pelts us with stylistic jabs even as spouts of red spray the screen it is a homage all right but with an extra dollop of ketchup tarantino relies on delirious highoctane camera work an exhilarating musical soundtrack and wonderfully choreographed sequences watch orens origin story told as a spectacularly brutal 7minute anime or the designedtobelegendary showdown between the bride and the crazy 88s or the final confrontation between the kimonoclad ishii and the bride against the floating snowflakes to punch up a story that never loses its intoxicating magnetism is tarantinos highly idiosyncratic and deeply personal excursion into a world of movieinspired unreality an unapologetic pulp scribe tarantino thinks nothing of dropping scores of allusions to the beloved pop culture of his youth into the brides universe vol 1 is tarantino in vintage form,cruel
before i start my review i have to say that i personally dont mind gory films if they are well executed and if it has a point or a story but this movie is full of gore and gore without any point in fact i felt like watching 1 hour of pointless gore random characters using sword to kill everyone in the movie geysers of blood created by the smallest wound and an immortal protagonistnow going to the plot itself if theres any its just pointless we spend 2030 minutes watching a girl getting her favorite weapon a sword then other 20 minutes watching the story of an evil japanese girl who beat her when she was pregnant and guess what does the director shows us during this development of the character gore we see how they kill their parents in quite an awful way oh and plenty of geysers of blood btw and with what point why should we care about this japanese gal because she hurt the protagonist come on how do you want me to have the slightest sympathy or care about the protagonist if the only thing you show me is her buying a swordwatch it at your own risk i guess its those kind of films that you either love or hate and sadly i did the later 110,cruel
a big slap in the face proving me once and for all that quentin tarantino is the most gifted and creative director of his generation vol 1 isnt just one of the most thrilling and stylish action films ever but also a captivating tale of revenge justice honor and redemption incarnated by one of the most iconic characters of the 2000s the bride  uma thurman in an oscar worthy performance and not only is a careerdefining film for tarantino the director but it also establishes his unique talent as a storytellerthe movie opens with a bloodsplattered face that belongs to the bride whose name will be beeped all through the film we see the massacre and foresee the recurrent theme in tarantinos films  revenge defined by the opening sentence as a dish served cold and the haunting music that interrupts the brides bill its your baby  directly plunges us in the darkness of her comatose state while she mourns an irreplaceable loss and wonders why her baby shot her down as usual music plays a crucial part in a tarantino film with this unique power to get us in the right mood and i cant think of any movie that pulled the strings of my emotions with such virtuosity i cant think of a movie with a greater soundtrack music is tarantinos language that translates what images and words cant express and considering the films style and the scenario this is saying a lotpays tribute to the famous kungfu asiatic bmovies that replaced the western spaghetti during the 70s these movies were famous for their choreographed fighting shakespearianthemed badly dubbed overthetop dialogs and stylish violence what they lacked in budget they made it up with style something that the action genre cruelly lacks now call them cheesy dated laughable but never underestimate the talent required for probably the most difficult genre to handle action requires a meticulous editing and a tactful direction and more than anything it needs authenticity in the story the hero the motives the emotions the bride is a wonderful cinematic creation embodying all the classic heroic virtues a woman who got the crap of her life beaten husband and relatives massacred by bill leader of the deadly viper assassination squad and an unborn child she couldnt even get a break at the hospital when the nurse buck used her as a sex doll but buck brings a client the wrong night when she decided she wont take it anymore he gets his comeuppance and she gets her car poetic justicethe fight scenes in transcend the charm of 70s kungfu films revering through them a whole culture that brought up so many iconic images and beautiful stories of virtue and courage as a kid who grew up with the mangas i cant describe how i felt when watching the chapter about oren ishi and how the violence orchestrated by the incredible luis bacalovs big duel music brought tears to my eyes and our empathy to orens backstory foreshadows our satisfaction when the bride will get her revenge when oren kills boss matsumoto who ordered the death of her parents she was literally savoring his blood like the exquisite taste of the cold dish more than the music the images the action takes time to introduce all the brides targets on which she swore revenge the first to die is vernita green now a homemaker with a fiveyear old girl coincidentally the same age as the brides daughter  if she was alive shell witness the brutal death of her mother a sad illustration of the implacable eye for an eye ruleeach character has one moment to shine in elle driver is introduced under a nurses disguise visiting the comatose bride for a lethal injection whistling the iconic twisted nerve theme before a serene male voice interrupts her and cancels the order for ethical reasons oren is chronologically the first target her crew is composed by gogo yubari a sadist schoolgirldressed bodyguard sofie fatale as the halffrench halfjapanese righthand and her henchmen the crazy 88 lead by johnny mo before getting oren the bride asks the legendary swordsmith hattori santo to forge her a sword this part is the last calm little moment before the storm conducted by the beautiful zhamfirs score the lonely shepherd here again i applaud tarantinos musical taste as the themed beautifully embodied samurai values with a morriconesque melody a beautiful melancholic sound before the music gets more frenetic following the bumblebee song the bride tails oren in tokyo to the last stand in a japanese restaurant where a barefeet female band plays some catchy japanese rockabillythe fight that follows is the climax the movie needed screaming villains sounds of strident gurgles geysers of blood painting the floor in red overthetop stylish a pastiche of whatever fascinates us in martial arts films and we know the bride will be victorious because she deserves to and tarantino has a way to show the fight after having thrilled us with a poetry that would have made kurosawa proud the last shot of the bride dominating the restaurants floor is like a ran painting and the concluding fight with oren with the santa esmeraldas instrumental sound concludes with oren apologizing for having mocked the bride as a last redemption  before joining her parentsof course the movie features tarantinos trademarks the nonlinear narrative structure edited by the late sally menke the action the violence a footfetish to the extreme not for my displeasure though but more than anything its about honor and revenge and the last minute featuring the shots of the second volume transported me again with zhamfirs music brining some tears back and hooking my heart with one of the most shocking finales ever with the last line starting by one more thing sofie ,cruel
i did not know that this movie has also a lot of haters who gave it only 1 i am not a blind tarantino fan who gives every tarantino movie 10 out of 10 and i am not one of the critics who try to cover up the flaws in his movies but we should accept that he is a very good filmmaker personally my favorite quentin tarantino film by far is volume 1 it is quintessential cinema also a pure mixture of art and entertainment vol 1 has one of the best opening sequences ever black and white visuals and that great music i believe that put his directing talent aside there are two things that he is great at writing dialogs and music like romance and cigarettes is a music collage from the old goods all the tracks are great and the important thing so coherent with the content visually and even including content is one of the most colorful movies so far this was the first cat fight i saw and probably there is not any other better it seems that to shoot a cat fight scene is very hard rather than planned choreography people dont fight in front of children in this movie i know that tarantino is not such a sensitive director but i appreciated it the second part of the movie is like a very stylish modern western like no country for old men it is slow paced like once upon a time in the west etc the plot of the movie is also one of the most engaging and exciting ones a revenge movie wouldnt be better as for the anime how a creative director tarantino is i had not seen any anime before it made me like anime however this is quintessential anime so my favorite in short length honestly still i am not an anime buff at all and i havent seen anime for a long time but this is special for me i watch it as occasion serves the assassination part was too short at least to me because i did not want it end thats the only problem the maps recall atari games animes atari games tarantino uses all of them when i was a child i loved the scenes in the movies which the hero of the movie chooses a weapon sword from the collection for example red sonja while watching i recalled red sonja the story editing after the bride goes to japan is weird from the plane till the motorbike in other words there are time lapses but this is not a flaw it does not make us feel like the editing is scratchy and may be otherwise the movie might have been pretty clich but still tarantino could added somethings the sword fights in this movie is the greatest the longest the most entertaining one and the most stylish one i forgot how many times i watched this chapter almost 50 from 2003 till now the violence here is not sick at all like hostels or rambo 4 it is not explotationish like saw movies and it is not disturbing like romeros zombie movies yes it is extremely bloody and violent but somehow looks pure mixture of art and entertainment it also deserves to be put in action cinema anthology especially editing and choreography is great the last chapter the place atmosphere had seemed me superficial when i watched the movie for the first time at theater but after i thought that may be it is supposed to be this chapter is so reposeful and still it is like relieving tiredness part not only for the characters but also for us then great spanishlike music and carnage of flowers my favorite track by the way i couldnt decipher the meaning of the ewer as for the ending one of the most impressive finals ever,cruel
i think that this film is a clever masterpiece if i could say that theres anything wrong with it its that its almost too clever if that can even be something wrong from the beginning tarantino absolutely just bombards you with various amounts of imagery what i find absolutely interesting about it was the combination of colors used from the set design to costume from start to finish this film is just completely psychedelic this film is also stunning when it comes to the sound effects used you get this real sense of a subliminal mythology and theres even an arc between films when you see the product of cigarettes advertised in this film thats mentioned in pulp fiction but the thing is just when you think quentins run out of ammowaittheres more,cruel
volume 1 is an amazing film that surpassed my expectations the second time i saw it i only saw it once a few years ago and didnt really like it i was young and dumb i just saw it again for the second time and loved it uma thurman kicks so many asses its funny not since pulp fiction have i enjoyed such a tarentino film i loved the original i did also see volume 2 when i was young and dumb i didnt like it either but i bet i will have the same treatment as the first one did i bet i will love it also has so many awesome scenes including the final scene where uma thurman slices up lucy lius accomplices or the part where she is about to be raped and she bites the guys lip off is an awesome film experience with great martial arts sequences you may not want to see it but i think you should see it anywaysthe plot a woman wakes up from a coma and seeks revenge on the people who put her in the coma she also seeks revenge on her old bride to be who murdered her baby and was behind her being put in the coma,cruel
this film is personal for me no that doesnt mean i cried or fell in love with it or decided tarantino was my dad or uma was my future wife pleez or anything like that this is the movie that single handedly determined my future as a filmmakeryes this uberviolent hyperstylized impossibly campy kung fu flick was the first film i ever saw where i stood back and said whoa that is fbomb awesome afterwards i decided i wanna do that toobefore i was like who is this quentin tarantino person and why should i care about his fourth movie mind you i was 13 at the time and didnt care about the ninties or the awesomeness that is pulp fiction yetso i watched vol 1 and was glued to the screen for 1 hour fortyfive minutes uma was super cool as the bride and as she hacked up all them crazy 88s i was having me one helluva time cheerin her on my favorite scene though was the last fight between her and oren ishii lucy liu it was so well done and had me afraid for a second that the bride would die only to be made very happy when she scalps oren it was the first hyperstylized over the top bloody gory slice n dicer id ever seen and it warped my already deranged mind to conclude best movie ever made maybe,cruel
volume 1 marked the return of quentin tarantino one of the most innovative directors of our time after a sixyear hiatus his previous film being 1997s disappointing jackie brown even though it was split into two parts the first two hours of tarantinos epic bloody masterpiece still resides with me as the better of the twowhile this film really does not get into much of the key story line that volume 2 taps into it still introduces us to the bride uma thurman shes a deadly assassin who was once part of what was known as the deadly viper assassination squad she decides to leave the squad one day settle down and create a family the squad feels otherwise and their leader bill david carradine sends the squad to kill her the entire wedding party is decimated and they leave the bride for dead with a bullet in her head four years pass where the bride is in a coma and what proceeds after she awakes is the start of a personal vendetta to kill all the members of the viper squad who ruined her lifeit may not sound like much coming from an auteur like tarantino or very original for that matter but his brilliance makes it original through his stylish use of dialogue story telling martial arts and especially camera angles he creates an absolutely amazing film that makes us remember why he was anything to talk about in the first place along with a beautifully drawn anime sequence this film is something to see to believe it has its intensely violent moments but its done so tastefully that it ends up looking like a modern piece of artwork and not something horrifically violent the choreography in every scene is just so perfect that it cannot be seen as anything but art his gigantic colour palate flying between uses of black and white to all sorts of colours is just astonishing it really brings into question why this film missed out on an art direction nomination at the academy awards that year or any award for that matter it is intensely violent yes but the way it is done is artful and brilliant thurman is fabulous as the bloodsoaked weeping bride and she makes for a great antihero for the ages the way she comes at this role is just so hardnosed and strong that it gives wonder to where all this acting talent has been bottled up for so many years a faceless carradine serves as the main antagonist and serves excellently in the scheme of things the supporting cast featuring lucy liu vivica a fox michael madsen daryl hannah and sonny chiba all are perfect in their roles no matter how short but the real supporting character to watch for is chiaki kuriyama who first got noticed in battle royale she had a bizarrely frightening aura about her there and it translates flawlessly to her role here for as small as the role gives her she steals the show and proves her worth if only she could continue getting roles like theseanother key greatness to the film is in the music as has become standard for tarantino much of it is ported over from old tunes from the likes of much older japanese martial arts films but just like those older tarantino films they flow beautifully into the film every blood soaked arts filled image has excellent and memorable music to go behind it that leave powerful visual images in the viewers mind they give it an authentic and distinct feeling that is so much different than most modern hollywood made film in a way it just shows how tarantino can make every facet of the picture work and make it visually astonishing to the eyesas long as you can stomach the intense graphic violence volume 1 is not one to have missed out on since its initial release this homage to the great martial art films of yesteryear is both insightful and brilliant tarantino has returned with a vengeance and i can only pray he keeps it up1010,cruel
a woman  with a past in a cartoon style assignation squad  is left for dead on her wedding day and vows the path of bloody revengethe thing that hardline critics and hardline lovers of this movie both agree on is there is no real story here and  more bizarrely  little of the pingpong dialogue that the director quentin tarantino made his name with maybe the fact that the movie was sliced in half is part of the problem  until i actually see part ii i will have to reserve judgementto date qt has made one great movie pulp fiction a very good movie reservoir dogs and a very average movie jackie brown you can see the direction this paragraph is going already  because this is below average hong kong fuey was made on the cheap for an initial audience that didnt have the education or the appetite for much thinking  why celebrate it on a big budget what is that all about it is like filming a hardcore porn film with the budget of the movie titanicthere is a movie called i spit on your grave that was about an abused woman taking revenge on her abusers chicago timeses roger ebert thought it was the worst movie he had ever seen it is dreadful true this has pretty much the same plot but has more killing blood and sadism  but he gives it top marks confused i certainly amlead uma thurman  here called only the bride  confuses me as an actress and a person marrieddivorcedmarriedchildrendivorced all before 30 and is a little strange looking with her model legs ending with massive policemans feet yes she can act a bit but like lauren bacall who she most resembles if the script is bad so is she and vice versaut is the best thing in this although i dont believe her for one secondwhen you carry a fully grown guy on the end of a sword as if wouldnt it buckle your knees a bit darling tarantino is in love with her in the classic hitchcock mode and fashion he knows he is too ugly and dorky to get in to her pants through natural means so he uses the casting couch and excusetobewith approach well done but it is all a big lie and we both know it given her fast turn over record on men there isnt much future in it eitherqt fails because he is tasteless and doesnt have a natural censor to call upon more is often less he oversteps the mark and loses control on most films he makes and here he gets plain silly there is no other word for it we linger on a woman squirting blood from a severed arm  but we linger for no reason other than to give the audience a cheap thrill and the less said about the comedy rape the betterthere is a lot of sword fighting and severed limbs in this movie  so much so that you are sick to death of it before our semiclimax we only get to the half way point remember which is more of the same only biggerlike having a three course meal made up of the same dishes over and over againtarantino is smart in knowing how to fit music to scenes often obscure pop and how this lets us linger for little reason on people doing nothing much more than walking down a corridor he is a good introducer and while avoiding some clichs he celebrates others hong kong cinema can do no wrong in his eyesto his credit he has not repeated himself in any of his efforts but this is an experiment gone wrong and the high marks and good reviews shows that more people are closet sadists than i would have imagined maybe that is too harsh a term it is more like the scene in the school playground when the school bully is beating the living crap out of someone and everyone is circling round thinking it is great and urging them on because it isnt them on the receiving end tarantino makes you one of those people  and i dont like it,cruel
i loved this movie as i do all other quentin tarantino films simply because it is a simple story with one central theme revenge it doesnt get much simpler usually a movie with a bland central theme will not fair to well however they way in which the story is played out and presented is what makes it so great in addition to just being a brilliant story the way music is used throughout the movie gives a quirky yet not at all out of place feel the first volume is most definitely the more gory of the 2 whereas vol2 gives more of the back story also there is a wholly different feel to the second one which is most likely why the two movies were separated even though they were a single story,cruel
the plot of this movie reminded me of the 70s martial arts movies when one fighter takes on 100 well trained fighters and still manages to kill all of them the thing i still dont understand with these battles is why the villains with large numbers attack one ore two at a time after the movie ended i wondered why none sense no plot action movies like these are so popular and what does it say about our society and culture i watched this movie because of friends recommendation i dont regret the time and money i spent renting this movie i felt sad that i hang out with people that like such movies i give it a rating of 0,cruel
i read so many good comments about so i decided that i have to see it before the next movie comes outso today i saw it and at the end of the movie i asked myself thats it all the movie was her killing 2 people with uninspired fightsand some scenes were so boring like the slow start why does it have to start without seeing anything but credits who wants to see a black background with white text credits for minutes at the beginning of a movie i hate starts that show you nothing with some weird music dont waste my time on white textalso if she wants to kill someone why all the hassle of fighting with your hands she could have killed those 2 women using a pistol and end it in 2 secondsand that big fight with those 50 ninjas thats simply unreasonable it was enough if they all jumped at her in all directions to end her her back was to them endless times and they didnt storm stupidstupid movie110,cruel
gross sickening really bad you see the previews and you think its good then you go there and all it is is people cutting of each others heads stabbing each other and killing each other blood is everywhere 110,cruel
by all measures this is a terrible movie  the acting is pathetic the soundtrack is odd and even the senseless violence gets extremely awkward at times  the writing is consistently bad except for some brief instances when it becomes acutely awfulthe only upsides to this movie1 they spared us the second half2 it is amusing at times when it intends to be amusing but much more often at times when the intentions are sincere3 those of us who are ffvi fans now know that gogo is a woman thus allowing us to move forward in our livesmy advice to anyone who gets dragged into going by their friends pass the time by making fun of the film  if your expectations were too high as mine were you will be miserable,cruel
i really think a lot of bmovie directors can create a movie that is far better and entertaining then this garbage over the top bs with flying heads and arms no good it should rate 5 tops quentin tarentino should watch back his movies more carefully maybe the next time hell bring out something watchable again instead of this trashit rates an 83 well there must be a lot of zombies that have voted here thenquentin tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema in a way that only he could yeah sure only he can make a movie this sad,cruel
the first half of the movie is probably the best action movie of the last 20 years it is intense well shot bloody engaging and absolutely stunning visually,cruel
can i just really review lucy liu i dont see why not shes 100 mojo,cruel
i loved this film very much it was very real and relatable and a wonderful cast adds icing to the cake i would highly recommend this movie,cruel

everything about this film is great the action and sound design is top notch aswell as the casting which puts female empowerment to the forefront with its choice of actors from uma thurman to lucy liu the story is entertaining with and incredible animated sequence aswell overall its just an incredible revenge story where tarantino continues to improve his form of filmmaking with masterfully directed action and visual storytellingeven more than 15 years after its release it still shines as one of quentins best being the first part of an incredible double feature everything from the casting dialogue sound music and visuals is all stellar its just an excellent modern kungfu classic se it if you havent seen it already,cruel
the violence the gore the humour the story telling the choreography they are all there i watched it then my opinion has not changed it has been tested by time and personal experiences,cruel
i had watched this movie about 70 times and each time i enjoyed too much after thinking many times i decided that it is my all time favorite movieyou will watch action drama thrilling events well made fights through out the entire film that is why cinema is made for ,cruel
vol 1 is considered by many to be a very violet film and is arguable considered by quentin tarantino to be his fourth film previously stated within the films opening credits tarantino makes it well known that this film is his as he does in all of his films where he makes it known that he is more important himself than his actual films or the actors acting in his films obviously selfrighteous but as a high level profile as himself one is able to do that plot appears to be relatively plotfree the film plays as one long homage to asian martial arts films and the plot serves only to provide excuses for the action set pieces which are undeniably as they are horrific the problem isnt the film is too violet is that the characters are not likable and everything occurring is quite predictable the action sequences are shot well but the film tries hard being more than that within the story centers a character known as the bride uma thurman who is working down her kill list in order to avenge the death of her unborn baby the group she is fighting goes by the name of the deadly viper assassination squad the movie is broken up into chapters very similar throughout using names such as the blood splattered bride the highlight of the movie sees near towards the middle of the ending where it hyperboles within a long hyperviolent type anime episode in the middle but then ultimately picking back up when it switches back to live action as the bride singlehighhandedly battles and defeats oren ishi lucy liu and her numerous warriors these last few fight sequences involving the bride defeating these ninja warriors is very unrealistic and hard to take serious as she is one woman completely destroying and fighting off far many trained assassins as a revenge movie the film makes it hard for us to root for the bride as she isnt a great character in any needs and very unlikable not too interesting either perhaps considered by many to be miscast by uma thurman and i am in agreement within this statement having been compared to the matrix 1999 the matrix is a far better film in about every area though just not near as violet overall volume 1 is slightly overrated and overhyped as a film but considering it is from pulp fiction director quentin tarantino this isnt surprising,cruel
is a film full of excesses the fight in tokyo is too long the script is disastrous the characters are flatthis movie has many mistakes although i must say the production has very correct things like the villains the brief actuation of elle driver is uncanny gogo yubari is the perfect enemy oren is marvelously wicked and sophie fatale is brilliant also the bride is fantastic meanwhile she is carrying through her revenge the music merit the oscar and the argument produces attraction perhaps isnt django or pulp fiction but we can feel tarantinos hand in this film my favorite character so far is elle driver i love the evil gaze of elle driver quentin tarantino chose very well the actors for the movie is wonder but definitely the mark is 60,cruel
i write this review 2 minutes after watching the movie for the first time and without having watched the sequel in three words i was thrilledto be honest having seen most of tarantinos work i was expecting a great film but since i had never been the most fanatic admirer of tarantino i am more into lynch kind of movies my expectations were kind of averagethe closeups of the director that are full of expresiveness and builtup emotion the relatively random songs right in the middle of the tense fights the contrast of colour throughout the whole film make this movie uinque really uniqueas my friends told me i am sure that this film hides a long list of references that my level of film critic do not allow to understand and judge i am also sure that after watching the next film and read all these critics i will engage in a long round of tracing the inspirations of in classic movies of another era however i can say one thing right now is a masterpiece and tarantino is rightly standing in the hall of fame of the greatest directors of all time,cruel
seeing the rating i was expecting a good movie however just a few minutes into the movie i got bored i knew that she will kill them all that she will be super powerful although i dont know why in a sarcasticrhetoric way for those who say that the sword is her source of powerful i can say she managed even without it in addition she have the autohealing option she can be cut deeply but just give her a few seconds she will be stronger even the fights are boring i extremely enjoy fights check kingsmani have no problem with violence and blood still i even skipped the most parts of the final fights  i skip very rarely  i almost get attached to all characters except her no story whatsoever and why would she assume that her kid isnt alive she didnt even asked i wasnt surprised by the last information in the movie someone killed in a hospital 13 hours later no one found out few months later no one said where is the patient  and check the country entrances and exits  and no one bothered about bucks car oh yeah his car is invisible just an ordinary one a katana cut be another is rather i dont know  i have a katana well i used to when confiscated by the customs service ,cruel
this couldve been an amazing revenge movie but it is ultimately brought down by numerous flaws such as plot holes no character development and a ton of overlysadistic violencethis story is about a woman known as the bride who was knocked out at her wedding where most of the people who attended it including her husband and supposedly her daughter were killed after waking up from a 4year long coma she seeks revenge on everyone who betrayed her and attempts to murder them all one by onequentin tarantino likes to make his plot lines out of order usually this is a good thing because it leaves a lot of room for rewatching his movies in fact that is one of the things which made pulp fiction and reservoir dogs so good however it doesnt work for this movie because some of the scenes in it make no sense at all and they dont seem to fit anywhere in the plot line of the movie it made me think that i somehow missed an earlier movie an example of these scenes include the scene when she fights a mother and kills her in front of her daughterthere is also no character development in the movie this movies final act requires for you to care about the characters in the film and the connection i was supposed to have just wasnt there for me i didnt feel this because the characters arent very developed in the film because of this it was hard for me to care about any of the characters in the film and i could care less for which ones lived and which ones died character development matters in films where the main character is facing death take this sentence and tell it to everyone who has ever thought of directing a movie beforealso there are numerous plot holes by far the biggest one is how the police are never called in the film examples of scenes in the film where the police shouldve been called include her killing a doctor and not even attempting to hide his body killing a mother in front of her own child and the massacre at the japanese restaurant at the end since the film is grounded in present day the police should have been called more often another plot hole in the film is how oren ishii got to the head of the japanese mafia despite having awful bodyguards and adequate fighting skills at bestquentin tarantino likes putting sadistic violence into his movies however he takes it way too far here people are decapitated eyeballs are ripped out young girls see their mothers murdered and people have their limbs cut off some people said that the violence is presented in an overthetop way but i didnt see that at all in this movie the violence is presented in a more serious way with people screaming in agony and people wriggling around on the ground like a worm after their body parts are chopped off this isnt fun violence the violence here is appalling deeply unpleasant and viscerally disturbing the sadism in this movie lacks any context and the movie is just being sadistic for the sake of sadism sadism also extends to other areas in the movie besides bloody violence such as how a doctor raped the bride when she was in a coma how the same doctor allowed other patients to rape her as well and a guy getting his head slammed in a door for information until he dies its utterly grotesque and it makes you feel sickened after watching italso the fight scene at the end between the bride and oren ishii felt very underwhelming unimpressive and slowmoving i felt more suspense in the crazy 88 fight and previous fights than that one the problem with it is that it had long instances of them pausing and staring at each other and a couple very short scenes of them fighting each other because of this it felt unnecessarily slowmoving also the few instances of them fighting were unimpressive to say the least since thats the final fight youll expect that shell have the most trouble killing her however ill argue that the elite crazy 88 and gogo yubari were more difficult for her to fight since they did more damage to heri will admit that there are some good parts to this film mainly that of the production design and cinematography sets are beautifully shot and gorgeous to look at the film also has pretty great acting which is much better than what the film deserves also the final few minutes are a pretty good ending and setup for the next film and the fight between the bride and gogo yubari is actually pretty goodhowever these few and minor positive points dont overshadow the numerous flaws in the movie because it has a poor plot line lack of character development plot holes sadistic violence and a disappointing final fight unfortunately because of this i cant really recommend to anyone except die hard tarantino fans and action movie and violence fanatics tarantino is a great filmmaker who has made many great movies in his career but he unfortunately wasted his time and money on a selfindulgent vanity project like this one,cruel
every time someone explains how good was i remember what happened when i told a chinese colleague how much i liked crouching tiger hidden dragon 2000 what was exciting for me was for him just another wuxia film merging kungfu with a love storytrue to himself tarantino merged kungfu motives with crime thriller and to certain extent western love story was relevant only for viewers who believe that love must hurt and in that is rather literalthe result is a watchable movie that is mostly interesting as it is the case in most of tarantino work this was not the one id like to see again it is not the violence that turns me off but a lack of message and the hype that surrounds it,cruel
this movie was just incredible i have always been a fan of quentin tarantino and his movies everything that there is to say about this movie has already been said so ill keep it simple and tell you what i loved about it growing up i loved anime and everything that came with it so when the movie included the animated section i was hyped out of my mind i also loved the finale just the music set to the extreme violence had me smiling throughout the entire sequence it is like tarantino put my entire childhood into one over the top entertaining movie there are simply not enough words to describe my love for this movie,cruel
this is the best martial arts movie ive ever seen you have to look at part one and two as a whole its not the best movie ever made so it does have some flaws but for me the plot action cinematography this is the best that i have seen tarantino when he made this established himself as my favorite directorwriter in the biz i hope there is a part 3 one day only one can hope only flaw i can really point to in the film is the fake cgi floating in the air in one of the fight scene that mimic crouching tiger hidden dragon but as i understand it this film was also suppose to be a tribute to all the early martial arts movies and although i dont like that part its only in one part really and is bearable and doesnt wreck the fight scene if i could give the film a 95 i would but i cant so a 10 is good enough i guess,cruel
in quite stereotypical tarantino fashion the director of pulp fiction converged together a critically acclaimed revenge movie in which uma thurman would play a bride on the rampage to me never quite lived up to the hype but i certainly wouldnt discard it nonethelessthurmans bride is battered and bruised by her previous boyfriends david carradine mobsters and thugs in  what was  an act of jealousy in an act of revenge thurman regains her strength to kill each of bills carradine assassins before finally taking her revenge on the man in question this first film revolves around her attempts to murder the dangerous o  ren ishii lucy liu the violence that is present throughout never really appealed to me to much not only is it over the top but also quite unrealistic the story is paper thin and there are no real twists or turns in this gruesome tale however having also seen volume two i can say that the plot there was much stronger despite a slower pacingstill thurmans acting is fantastic while all other cast members are also faultless in their rolesi cant call it award worthy  even though it was  however i definitely wouldnt give it the brush off on a friday night,cruel
yet another example of creative film making which had the potential to be fantastic but ended up miserable vol 1 and vol 2 for that matter is an ponderous pretentious overlong disappointing revenge drama which clearly and easily could have been saved via the normal efforts of a decent story or objective movie editor who was not mr tarantino or influenced by him i believe tarantino like lucas and many other notables do their best work when they do not have too much control over the story and pacing kb has many fine points an original plot great casting music great camera work but fails completely in the script pacing and yes the action sequences which are vital to the creation of a good movie especially of this genre the scripts were all too contrived boring irrelevant and unnatural for the characters too brooding and deeply philosophical which was as distracting as it was annoying and tarantino seems to have this arrogant assumption that we love his pretentious dialogues and inner monologues as much as he does the character development was insufficient primarily umas who is supposed to be such a deadly assassin yet there is little or no back story which validates this it would have been invaluable to have included some earlier scenes with uma as the warriorassassin she proves once and only once in the ridiculous crazy 88 fight sequence but that is a sequence which is unconvincing because watching her slice up 88 stupid bodyguards is boring so instead of having one of the slowestpaced movies i have ever watched simply speed things up a little such as that painfully slow animated oren sequence and in other areas and add in some assassin background on uma i enjoyed the fight scene of orens personal bodyguard in vol 1 and the alltooshort training scene in vol 2 with the kung fu master but that was not really showing uma as this assassin nor unbeatable swordmaster in fact probably my biggest pet peeve of the both kbs is the odd fact that neither film shows any real sword fighting or special combat scenes among the master assassins there is plenty of talk throughout both films about sword fighting etc but all the scenes except that long repetitive implausible fight scene with the 88s involved quick sequences usually in tight quarters think about it all the people on her list were killed quickly and without any real martial arts oren elle green and bill all were killed by kiddo uma quickly and with hardly any sword play yes there was a very brief sword fight with oren but with all the buildup of orens ability i would have expected their sword fight to be 3x longer at least and more exciting instead of spending 30 minutes watching uma fighting 100s of stupid bodyguard ninjas and all attacking her one at a time this made no sense and for me ruined the movie since i would have expected all the villains on umas list to be killed in true martial arts combat scenes with swords since they spend both movies talking endlessly about hattori hanzo swords in addition to oren being killed easily with only a few swings of umas sword green is killed boringly inside her house despite talking about scheduling a knife fight elle is killed again inside a small cramp house without even one swing of either of their hanzo amazing swords yawn yawn all the fights were more of a street brawl or cat fight than a kung fu battle why not go outside for a real fight and budd was killed by elle not even by uma again boring bill the ultimate villain is killed in seconds by uma with a cool but all too quick heart explosion trick after the audience sits through yet another excruciatingly slow pontificating dialogue between them in both films there is nothing to validate how deadly and masterful a fighter bill is geez all in all kb is a film which had great potential but a misguided director and writerseditors who gave the audience no real kung fu or sword fight scenes among the main characters and thus left us with never really seeing any impressive swordplay or hand to hand kung fu instead we have a boring unsatisfying film a shame,cruel
after the not so successful jackie brown quentin tarantino became a unknown and forgotten legend with only 3 films on his career 6 years later tarantino confirmed his great return to filmmaking with vol 12 many did not believe thought he had lost his originality his style would never fix in this new generation but boy we were wrongboth part 1 and 2 show the great talent of tarantino and shows why he is a true legend in cinema not only keeps its great and very intelligent originality but also makes a great tribute to the old kung fu and martial arts movies alongside with the old classic western style all in both vols that function as a single moviethe story begins with another unforgettable character of tarantino the bride uma thurman a beautiful blond woman appearing punched and shot in the head at her wedding thats why she is called the bride she was unmarked so the police dubbed in that wayapparently she survived and after a 4 years coma she wake up and find out that she had lost her baby she was also pregnant she swear it revenge against those responsible  their former coworkers and her lover bill david carradine the bride was an assassin who worked for her lover soon after she found out that was pregnant she run away from the killing business after a few years their own former colleagues along with bill went after her to put an end for this betrayal but they only woke up a sleeping giantin the 1st part of the story we see the bride going after the first two targets on her list oren ishii lucy liu the queen of all the japanese mafia and vernita green vivica a fox a simple housewife in this first part tarantino shows his great talent in making a bloody violence and also pays tribute to the old kung fu and martial arts movies all together delivering a bloody battle between the bride and the crazy 88s the private army of teens samurai working for oren with a direction that is simply superbin part 2 we continue with the great quest of vengeance of the bride after the other names on her list budd michael madsen the lazy goodhearted own bills brother and elle driver daryl hannah the cruel new lover of bill and also the man itself finally in personbill part 2 differs a bit from part 1 while the 1st is seemed a crazy and beautiful martialarts film the 2nd part is also crazy but now is a true modern western with angry blondes killing themselves not only in action scenes which are few here that tarantino excels directing but also delivers a fantastic and original writing giving dialogs full of tarantino smartness and a fun black humornot only that tarantino is highlighted with a brilliant screenplay and his stylish direction but also the entire cast that fits perfectly into tarantino style all simply excellent michael superb david carradine fantastic as ever uma thurman perfect badass suffering hilarious unforgettablewas the big return of tarantino to show that he came to stay with a story very well written and directed together with unforgettable characters with tarantino style more enhanced conquering fans of this generation and won even more in the future but not forgetting this unforgettable classic,cruel
vol 1  vol 2 choosing which 1 is best aint easy 1 moves along at a slicker pace 2 has tons more prolonged suspense the 2 movies are suitably unalike although still equally great ill stick to the 1st 1 as i completely understand many would its got better action for the most part but dont sleep on the 2nd 1 quentin tarantino joins all his favorite movie genres kungfu samurai and spaghetti western in the tarantino is the master at creating captivating conversation delivering clichd dialogue to a flawless degree this skill was showcased perfectly in pulp fiction it was done in inglourious basterds to a dazzling effect but the drawn out dialogue in 1 while remaining very entertaining is oft overutilized the talks between beatrix and vernita green aka copperhead during their knife fight the chitchat with hattori hanzo before he forges the brides steel and boss tanaka questioning oren ishiis position of power during council are some of the main moments being slowed in accommodation vol 1 is at its best when things are happening at a highly stylized progressive pace the attentive developing plot the accompanying narration the crossover to anime the excessively bloody effects the alarming signature theme when the bride is zoning in on her target the quick slick camera cuts blended with sharp sound and wellplaced music in presentation of adrenaline pumping overly intense action makes really awesome and really badass the battle between the bride and oren ishii and all of her subordinates at the dojo hangout in tokyo is really insane and the end stands out from the rest of the movie as being really really awesome and really really badass especially gogo vs the bride there is no actress better to be the bride than uma thurman shes heroically merciless vol 1 is a superb outing from the entirely too talented tarantino,cruel
with a blink of an eye or removal of one delivers a masterfully and deliciously edited story of a bride fixated on revenge paced for a new generation doesnt simply pay homage via the film genre cooking recipe it packages each scene as if its a greatest hits compilation dont flinch due to the sword induced refugee limbs as the storytelling is enhanced by the blood fireworks on display due to the rampage of the bride uma thurman wins as the ultimate heroine in chic glory its her story that quintan orchestrates as diligently as weve come to expect the sound track deserves merit carrying long scenes and has become a usual character in each tarantino experience with that sporty retro spirit,cruel
i am actually talking about both the first and the second volume of the movies both are really good but if you are looking for action the first one offers action on top of action on top of action did i mention it had a lot of action the movie still stands as one of the most violent movies ever made the movie is just entertaining and not only does it have action it has emotionthe story starts off with the bride waking up in a coma and finding out she has been in a coma for about 4 years because a group of people tried to kill her she was also pregnant at the time so she goes out to get vengeance for her and her baby killing every one of the people responsiblei am trying as hard as i can not to give away any spoilers and i believe i am doing a good job at the end of the first movie you will witness one of the most violent action packed and a large amount of payback if you are a fan of action movies you will really enjoy this movie some more than others thanks for reading my review,cruel
just watched this yesterday and i was so disappointed it started of great and i thought that this was so cool but then it just became annoying like what was up with the sword it just dragged on and on and they handled it like it was a miracle come on it was a frickin sword not a miracle that was just ridiculousand when she comes to kill oren ishii and she kills a whole army of men just like that that was so ridiculous and unrealistic and even more annoying with all the blood coming out of them like a fountain really  all the chopped of limbs and annoying cartoon in the middle of it i see how men would love this movie but as a girl i dont get it why would they put a woman in the lead when its a movie made for meni was just hoping it would end soon cause i was so bored i never saw how it ended and i really dont care big disappointment,cruel
before i watched this movie i was intrigued by the title itself it was a one of a kind title design simple but enough to catch attention the action scenes were fantastic and i must say that the duel between the bride and vernita green was excellent the fight was perfectly choreographed and was realistic the showdown at the house of blue leaves was a perfect climax the casting was also perfect all the actors in this movie did a great job in portraying their respective characters they brought life to their characters by showing off emotions of guilt and maleficence vernita green and oren ishii in particular daryl hannah did an excellent portrayal of elle driver as the guiltless and wicked assassin who has no feeling of remorse most of all quentin tarantino proved that he is a master of his genre he was successful in blending several film genres into one exceptional movie the only flaw i saw in this movie is the legal implication of the brides actions for example she killed buck and escaped from the hospital and was able to stay in bucks truck for 13 hours without being searched at that point the police must have traced her in the truck unless the police in the community were not cautious enough however that flaw was overshadowed by the movies excellent story and intelligent conversations the story is simple yet assertive and provocative this is a movie that i must have watched a hundred times,cruel
volume 1 is a great film by quentin tarantino it is a film about a woman uma thurman who is out for revenge after she was brutally shot in the head at her wedding had her baby stolen and her whole wedding party was murdered it is very fast paced and action packed there are tons of gory martial arts fighting scenes and sword fights the director quentin tarantino pays homage to a lot of old asian martial arts films throughout the movie in the opening credits he uses the feature presentation screen of an old martial arts film before the actual opening credits begin there are many fight scenes that are very over the top and clich as well one example being the sword fight scene in the snow japanese garden at night which looks as though it was taken straight from an old asian kung fu movie the film is full of artistic style the music of the film is very fitting and does not feel out of place much of it has a classic asian style with a modern twist to it the lighting is done well and the grimmest scenes are shot in black and white such as the scene in the beginning where bill shoots the bride in the head there is even part of the film that uses anime animation to tell the back story of oren ishii luci liu instead of using live action the anime portion of the film is very dramatic gory and over the top but it does a great job of conveying the tragedy and terror that made oren ishii become who she was using live actors would not have been nearly as effective some scenes in the film look unrealistic on purpose and they add to the feeling of watching an old asian martial arts film one such scene is the scene of the plane flying over tokyo japan in that scene it is easy to see that the plane and the city are not real and that they are models even with the very gloomy theme of revenge in the film some parts are actually funny one such scene is when black mamba is fighting vernita green vivica a fox in her house when vernita greens daughter gets home from school both fighters stop and hide their knives and pretend nothing wrong has happened even as the little girl can see the room is destroyed i recommend this film to anyone who likes action films or old martial arts films it is one of the best and most artistic films i have seen in a long time but be warned if you do not like violence this film is not for you,cruel
spoiler alertvol 1 stars uma thurman as the bride she is a very rage driven woman and has only one goal that goal is to who is played by david carradine the bride goes through many different action packed scenes to inch her way closer and closer to bill she has to kill many of her past coworkers to get more information about where bill is and because she also wants revenge against them she carries around list of 5 names on it and she ventures out to kill them all the list was made up of oren shi played by lucy liu vernita green played by vivica fox bud played by michael madsen elle driver played by daryl hannah and of course bills name was the last on the list written bigger than the rest and underlined twicein vol 1 the bride only gets through 2 people on her list of 5 but she kills them herself she kills oren shi and vernita green the theme of this movie is a scorned women seeking revenge on the people that hurt her she is also seeking revenge because she believes these people killed her unborn child this film is a very unique action packed revenge story this movie can be compared to the movie hannibal rising which is also a revenge story in a sick twisted waytwo techniques that make this movie so great are the motif and the angle the motif in this movie is the bride staying on one strict path the whole movie she is on the path to get revenge on the 5 people that hurt her and nothing else there isnt much else she thinks about other than her revenge the angle in this movie is the best part about it the way they position the camera angle during fight scenes and close up face shots to show their attitude during stressful situations my favorite camera angle during the whole movie is during the fight between the bride and oren shi the angling really make the scene what it isthis movie is a great actionrevenge story that rides the line of being a little cheesy but in a good way it is one of quentin tarantinos great films and continues to be great in vol 2,cruel
no spoilerswhen i first saw i truly loved it its a masterpiece i had never seen a film since the usual suspects with such a good screenplaythe film itself its about this woman who wakes up from a comma and wants revenge no more details so you can see everything im telling youthe film is packed with crazy action and hilarious extreme and excessive use of blood the acting is good but thats not the reason that made me love it if any of you have seen pulp fiction you will notice that quentin never tells you whats inside the mysterious suitcase he does exactly the same in but this time with the brides name every time someone is going to call her by her name theres a little disturbing but at the same time funny sound made its that kind of sound that the tv shows play when someone is cursing or saying a bad wordif you havent seen it and you consider yourself someone please rent it or buy it right nowits a true masterpiece packed with those little details every tarantinos fans like1110,cruel
the first of a planned three part trilogy quentin tarantino is heavily influenced by the asian kung fu film industry which began in the 1970s una thurman is the bride a martial arts expert seeking revenge on her former friends who are trying to kill herher former boss and trainer billdavid carradine has become her enemy because she is marrying someone else daryl hannah vivica fox and lucy lui are amongst her former partner assassins now out for the brides headaction is the main element in this highly charged and always entertaining fight fest with excellent battle sequences the choreography being done perfectlythe bride travels to japan to obtain the finest sword possible for upcoming battles we will of course see the deadly instrument of forged steel be put to good use tarantino keeps things moving smoothly as always the director is a master,cruel
dont worry because this review is spoiler free is tarantinos fourth film and you have been following tarantinos work you will know that the first three films have been very successful this movie does not disappoint but like most of the directors work the film is a somewhat cheesier type of film its cheesiness is rather unique though because it is not the acting thats cheesy but more or less the style of the movie if you have seen the films like planet terror death proof and machete and enjoyed them well then you most certainly will enjoy this film but on the other hand if you found them fake cheesy and stupid well then you might want to skip this one all i can say is it really is a matter of opinion and judgement and in my opinion tarantino has yet nailed another film,cruel
revenge is a dish best served coldwelcome to the fiefdom of a world where blood springs like water from the fountain of youth heads fly like wild magpies people are slaughtered like unfortunate pigs and in the end you are still with a sadistic smile lingering on your lips is a movie about revenge wrath decapitation blood bath swords evisceration assassins i could go on for a whileone of those rare films with a female protagonist is about an exassassin bride uma thurman who was called black mamba in her better days a bullet has been put through her head on her wedding alter and she has been left for dead the culprits  her excomrades leader bill and a bunch of others but she doesnt die not just yet after remaining comatose for four years she flips her eyes open first realization  the baby she carried is gone second realization  human tongues dont taste very good third realization  she has been immobilized from her knee down final realization  someone needs to dietarantinos movies have a raw power about them and you can observe that through each of his films he doesnt delve in being creepy or mysterious if its murder it wont be a carefully injected air bubble in someones vein it will be a knife in the eye takes this to a splendid new level the movie is certainly not for the squeamish and even those with otherwise strong stomachs should ensure that they havent eaten anything volatile before watching it the gore is immense the blood flow relentless and the violence would probably make gandhi pee his pants at the same time it doesnt disgust you and only tarantino could pull of something like thisthe film has all the necessary ingredients of a vintage tarantino flick his direction has a certain childlike quality about it the title itself seems like a tenyear olds attempt at creativity the movie has been made as neatly as a courtroom drama  hard camera shots clever dialogue rising tension  but underneath its an almighty mess something like a monster dressed as santa there is the trademark from thetrunk camera shot and this time he even puts in a bonus froma bulletholeinthehead shotsimilar to tarantinos second movie pulp fiction too doesnt rely very heavily on its plot which is virtually nonexistent it is driven by the execution movies are meant for escapism and the director knows this the story has been stretched to a point where it becomes almost farcical which is also an escapists paradise things that would have been awfully heinous otherwise become rather likable in the hands of tarantino added to it is a dark tone and black comedy which make it highly even more compelling call me despicable but there is something oddly appealing about cornflakes drenched in bloodit is the subtle things that catch your attention and define the beauty of the movie the cinematography is breathtaking right from a bullet leaving a gun to the largescale mass murders every scene is awe inspiring theres bw slomo and censoring of names there is a part in anime a montage about the past of oren ishii lucy liu a deadly assassin tokyos mobboss and number one on the brides hitlist perhaps he did it to show a relation between orens half japanese ancestry or maybe he did to avoid getting an nc17 rating theres a paedophilic goon orens a kid add two and twothe eclectic soundtrack by rza can be termed as one of the most befitting ever heard in hollywood it reached 45 on the billboard 200 album chart and 1 on the soundtracks chart so you see what i mean it builds tension superbly often causing feverish excitement if you close your eyes and listen to the music playing during the battles in the movie you can still feel the adrenaline coursing through your body  thats how amazing it isuma thurman does a wonderful job as the vendettaseeking yellowhaired bride she clears all sexist misconceptions from your mind about men being better at war than women she is lethal and ruthless with an ever present sardonic smirk on her lips  a true femme fatale you have to give her credit for managing to hold onto her expressions while performing things that are absolutely nutsvol1 does not offer a satisfactory conclusion leaving expectations of a second part which tarantino duly followed it up with it leaves many questions unanswered many people unkilled and many viewers thirsty for more bloodshedhowever while parting the movie does teach a very important lesson  when you kill a woman you need to make sure that she is dead because if she isnt boy you are screwed,cruel
is set in a twisted reality japanese manga kinda world the best thing about the film that we rarely see in others is that they tell the story nice and slowly so that you just enjoy dont have to put the pieces together true that theres a couple of jumbled scenes and i am not a fan of that because its really doesnt bring any thing to the table story wise but it is not over used crappy cons although the action and fighting looked really cool the camera angels gave it away for me most of the fighting we see was too zoomed in up close and this takes away the sense of reality and technical possibility to it that youd have to replay because you didnt catch wat the hell happened in the last 03 seconds,cruel
1 is very boring not up to the usual tarantino standards characterisation one dimensional especially giving me no reason to care whether the uma thurman character lives or dies lets face it she was a member of criminal assassin organisation so once this was revealed all sympathy for her went clean out the window over 50 of the movie is endless fight action which is very tedious i mean once youve seen a limb or head being hacked off youve seen them all this is the prime content of the movie no story no characters no interesting or amusing dialogue what a yawn and what a ripoff for moviegoers to spread such thin content over several films thank god i never paid cinema prices to watch 1 bought secondhand dvds in an oxfam charity shop for a couple of quid i would have felt cheated to come to the end of the movie and find it hasnt finished the story tarantino came up with could easily be told in one film the material is simply not strong enough to stretch over two or three films i wasnt convinced uma thurman was the best woman for the part her performance was mediocre it is such a drag when stars depend entirely on their looks to give flesh to a role the positive side to the movie is the cinematography the staging and the soundtrack which are all excellent i appreciated the innovation of using anime cartoon for telling some of the back story which showed tarantinos genius for creative originality i also liked the cross references between samurai and western particularly spaghetti movies using ennio morricone type music i especially loved the use of the scary theme tune from the hailey mills and hywell bennett 1970s psycho chiller twisted nerve which i immediately recognisedoverall if i had not bought one and two as a job lot i wouldnt be motivated to watch episode two of kb after watching episode 1 i simply wouldnt care enough as to what happens next but since i already have 2 in my possession i might as well watch it even if the only pleasure i get from it is hopefully more interesting cinematography and entertaining music soundtrack,cruel
volume one has to be one of the surprising movies i have ever seen i had no intention to see this because i was turned off by the previews and the previous uma movie i seen before this was batman and robin and she was horrible im glad i did because this is definitely an exciting filmthis is about a former bridetobe who is left for dead on her wedding day while everyone else is killed when she wakes up she decides to go out for revengei was skeptical of uma at first because of her batman and robin role but the moment she appeared that thought vanished from my mind i really liked the fight scenes at the end featuring lucy liuthis movie is very violent i would not recommend this movie to young children of course its very gory and i liked itthe music is here is very good it sounded like some traditional instruments were used in the scoreoverall this is a very good action movie i am highly anticipating the second one i rate this film 1010,cruel
vol1 is one of the most exciting and stylish action movies made in recent years it doesnt conform to hollywood conventions and as a result is very fresh and entertaining it takes the age old revenge formula and injects new life into the premise and comes up with some real originality is vastly different than any film out therethanks to its witty dialogueimaginative plotting and fascinating characters vol 1 doesnt really offer much in the way of emotion but that doesnt matter this is a wild ride of a movieone you do not want to miss it provides awesome action and a steady supply of humorthis is a very original creation and is one of the most stand out films i have ever seen it may not be quite as good as pulp fiction or even kill vill vol 2tarantinos other great works but those films were masterpiecesin my opinion anywayand the fact that it isnt as good as those films doesnt put it down in any way so if you are a fan of tarantinos work or you just want to see a really originalcrazy action picturethis movie is for you,cruel
when i first heard of in 2003 saw the trailer etc i though this has to be crap just violence and violence and no structure then i forgot about it the a few years later i started looking into tarantino films i saw his newest one inglorious basterds and i though wow this is pretty good it was refreshing to see someone with a unique and classical directing style then i saw pulp fiction and reservoir dogs and already i considered him one of the greatest directors ever then after having seen death proof not his best by the way i figured  you know what its about time i sit down and watch volume 1 so i sat down and saw it and these are my thoughts on itdespite not being the kind of movie i like i really liked this movie okay that sounds weird but its how it is revenge movies and japanese movies and especially anime is on the bottom of my like list hate me if you want but i fail to see the attraction to it however this movie is so well made i put all of that aside the tag line tarantinos 4th film as if it is very relevant is well placed in its context when i saw reservoir dogs i though no way this is his first film its too good he made two more films and didnt disappoint so his fourth movie surely had to be a cinematic masterpiece and i personally think it should qualify as such it has a visual style both corny and artistic at the same time he really taps into the heart of a good exploitation film it is a surprisingly profound moviebut now that ive praised this movie i guess the complaint should be written down as well i only have one complaint about this movie which isnt actually much of a complaint the violence and dont get me wrong i am not against violence in films in any way inf act i often think its very important to make a good and shocking film however i think that there is only one thing that stands int he way of quentin tarantinos artistic abilities hes need for violence his grindhouse feature following death proof proved this point the violence got in the way of the storya nd the story got less impressive i understand tarantinos need to channel his violence ideas through films but im afraid he might go too far one day this film an example of how that might one day ruing his filmshaving set that aside i give this movie a 910 and finish by saying i really look forward to kil bill volume 2,cruel
firstly i like action thrillers and martial art films however this film is garbage i dont know how anyone can like this filmthere are various reasons why this film was awful a the violence was over the top disgusting and it actually disgusted me i could tell it was fake as well now the storyline that was pathetic as i felt that the bride could have been killed by daryl hannahs character early on the film i did not agree y billdavid carradinesaid to daryls character to not to kill her i just didnt agree with thatb even when she woke up the attackers and bill werent even prosecuted the gang have murdered people and attempted to murder her this is just unbelievablec the direction was terrible tarantino made a mess with this film and rushed it i think he just made for money it was his worst film that he has madefinally i never have turned off a movie before this one however i turned this horrendous film off before it finished thats how bad it was it was trash i would give this film a 010 rating,cruel
i finally got to watch both parts of last night yes i know im latei have to say that while it wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen way too many people use that idiotic description it was probably the most selfindulgent and pretentious film ive seen in many a long year of watching many moviesthe entire film could and should have been edited down to a single 2hour film the hommage to asian martial arts films was amusing for a few minutes but then quentin proved his usual inept self and slathered the whole thing in sergio leonestyle spaghetti western musici did find parts of the filmsamusing but over all it was just too much of the same thing over and overi dont see this film as groundbreaking in any way it is simply repeating clichs from bad films and having the incredible pretense to imply that somehow it is good,cruel
much of this film annoyed me i didnt mind the violence mostly comicbook style apart from the initial vicious encounter with vivica fox i didnt mind the switching of styles anime monochrome hong kong kung fu movie etci did mind however that it was all style and no substance at no point did i care in the slightest what happened to this woman because i knew nothing about her and that lack of emotional investment fatally marred the movie for me to the extent that i didnt bother to see volume 2 when it came out although i did see it later plus it really annoyed me really really really that she should wheel her atrophied legs from her room to the hospital parking lot spend long enough lying in the back of the truck for there to be a detailed flashback i think the caption was 12 hours later and in those 12 hours not only did noone come looking for the missing patient with the 2 dead bodies in her room but the wheelchair she left outside the truck vanished tarantinos strength is supposed to be his writing and this distracting detail was the result of lazy lazy scriptwritingbut volume 2 aha,cruel
first of all i am utterly bored with action movies they are idiotic repetitive and dull so for someone to make a sort of homage  admittedly mixed with parody  to this genre says a lot about the persons intelligence tarantino that ol idiot savant has great talent with the camera and certainly can come up with an original scene or two however he is a moron there isnt an iota of intellectuality in him or his movies not that this is at all essential in movies because were it so there would be about 5 good movies in the last 100 years so to expect him to make an intelligent movie this will never ever happen that he is fascinated by asian actioners says a lot about his retardation he has always been this childish nerd who made very good films and always will be but while i like all his previous films it has to be said that they are entertaining but cretinous is his fourth and most cretinous film to date as a director its also his weakest perhaps rarely boring i admit but the action though stylized is still just people breaking each others bones not so fascinating its been done a zillion times the teenage audiences would disagree but then again teens today have never been dumber rap fashion and cell phones being the height of artistry andor importance in their empty little livesthe positive things about the movie are the music which is so far the best of all his movies i particularly hated some of it in pulp fiction god knows why people love that awful soundtrack the visual quality and the style and the fact that it does maintain interestone of the problems i have with it is that i dont quite understand why tarantino made a film that has comicbook bugsbunny violence in it  and yet tries to make us take the main character and her mission of revenge too seriously this simply cant work you either make an allout silly movie or you make it in a serious vein in which case you need action scenes that dont look like they came straight out of a road runner cartoon but this only goes to show what a moron tarantino is lucky for him that 90 of the public are about as dumb as he is so not many are really bothered by thisanother problem is the cast the worst so far i have no idea why but apart from his first movie reservoir dogs he has always chosen subpar actors for his movies  with some notable exceptions in pf he chose travolta arquette de medeiros thurman mediocrities in bb he actually wasted his time casting bridget fonda and keaton the little twerp playing the cop this time around he practically employs a uniformly forgettable cast thurman carradine darryl hannah why two reasons 1 it seems tarantino definitely has a nepotism complex he loves using sons and daughters of other actors which maybe makes him feel closer to and hence part of hollywood mythology andor royalty i know this would be a pathetic and moronic way of thinking but hey its tarantino were talking about after all when a moron like david arquette shows up on the scene people talk about hollywood royalty people without half a braincell obviously 2 tarantino has revived travoltas career and brought some other forgotten stars from the 70s his favourite decade into temporary spotlight he must think that he has this power to rejuvenate the career of any actor that he wants perhaps he feels that his movies are so good that any cast will be great in them where are the keitels buscemis roths jacksons and other good ones he used before he doesnt have a single highquality actor in this  in a film with plenty of colourful  if clichd characters his love for thurman and i mean genuine sexual love blinds him to the fact that she is a mediocre actress its a credit to him that she has been always best in his movies  but thats her best not worth much every nontarantino movie id seen her in she was mediocre or even amateurish typical modelturnedactress and his private obsession with her goes so far as to film her disgusting oversized feet in one scene yuck does he actually think her feet are sexy shes about 185 cm that damn giraffe the only potentially sexy thing about her would be her boobs  provided theyre realif youre interested in my hollywood nepotism list with over 300 picturesentries contact me by email,cruel
its a trashy movie done for entertainment well if you find wasting the time of your life entertaining  you are welcome to the universe of the mighty quentino tarantino bigname actors outstanding fight sequences and impressive storytelling  it all cries out we are going for gold some western characters are trying to show off as if they were bruce lees sonny chibas or jackie chans one matter makes me real uneasy this piece dealing with secondhand trifle things which we saw before in other movies occupies a place of honour on imdb top 250 list and note that poor wire stunt on the railing when the japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat  that looked so amateurish and goofy and if you notice that the snowfall is fake and consists of torn paper better watch smeshariki or luntik instead japanese actors should be ashamed to take part in this western action flick of the glorious masterwhat about very original and entertaining police story once upon a time in china city hunter armour of god and quite a number of other genuine titles they are outsiders hopefully the situation will change and the real classics will finally oust the boxoffice modern mcdonalds gems from the top listand if you recall such titles as snow blood and battle royal this will really shrink to something like a wet and dirty toilet paper rollit has zero value though it tries so hard to be so special  1 point out of 10 thanks for attention,cruel
quentin tarantinos fourth film what an egomaniac and it shows in this movie where hes more concerned with showing us how cleverly he understands all the genres he loves to parody than he is with creating anything new and substantial im glad i didnt pay money to see this having just seen it on tntthere are some good parts here and there like the fight with vivica fox and you cant really hate a movie which lionizes the triumph of the human will over adverse circumstances and the fight choreography is good even though overall fight execution is only sosothis is why i gave the movie a 410 instead of a 210 but for the most part this film sports a kind of selfconscious cheesiness i find unbearable and nearly unwatchable and then theres that whole thing with oren i just dont find lucy liu believable either as a beautiful woman or as a badass martial artist,cruel
i loved pulp fiction and resouvier dogs i hated so much that i have absolutely no intention of ever seeing 2 what kb says to me is that quentin had only a couple of good story lines in him and hes already done them now hes still got to put food on the plate and tell his friends that hes got a job and so he continues to make movies but the difference is that hes got no decent ideas left ive always wanted to do a strictly revenge movie yeah ive always had a bunch of empty movie ideas in my head too but no one is prepared to back me like they are with tarantino so what is the problem with kb pulp and dogs were fabulous from the opening scenes the dialogue music characters and everything else was terrific and the films continued that way all the way through starts with none of that and the opening scene really tells the whole story a blonde woman that i have no reason to give a stuff about we have no idea who she is at the start since there has been no character build up walks up to a door that is opened by another woman that i have no reason to give a stuff about for the same reasons and then we are accosted by the cheesiest dramatic music and camera play ive ever seen and the director screams at me in my chair this is an exciting moment youre supposed to be excited about the approaching confrontation um why i dont care about either of these women we dont know who they are so who gives a rats bum if the whole building blows up and we cut to some different actors for the rest of the flick unfortunately the rest of the flick did nothing to save this sad beginning and i found myself not caring about this blonde woman for an hour and a half do you really mean to tell me that i have to wait till the end of 2 to find out whether bill was justified in what he did to this woman or whether shes been hard done by get stuffed ive got better things to do and far better films to watch oh yeah i did enjoy the japanese cartoon section in fact i found it to be down right hilarious i felt like i was watching one of those tv skit shows that rip off other shows and movies and i laughed so hard that i had tears streaming down my face after that the rest of the movie continued to waste my time if quentin wants to take my money again one day in the future i hope he puts in a little work and effort next time to make it worth my while,cruel
after long threatening to make a pure genre film  a film the plot and episodes of which are constructed by genre convention and always secondary to the enjoyment of the action  tarantino has produced a quirky but facedpaced homage to the chinese and japanese martial arts films of the 1970s and some of their american clones as welltheres certainly no denying that the action sequences are rapidly paced and professionally shot and edited the story is loose and a little hackneyed but thats exactly what a genrefilm plot ought to be since it is really just an excuse for the action so of course the dialog is riddled with clich that also is as it should bei suppose most of this will be missed by those unfamiliar with the 70s martial arts film but they may be able to enjoy it as just an ironyladen action film of the current eraat any rate anyone who thought the chiba streetfighter films fun stuff or who harbored a secret passion for tnt jackson will certainly enjoy this filmthe one weakness is uma thurman she was wellcast in pulp fiction but i havens seen anything with her that ive liked since here she is just way too over the top for this kind of film the martial arts hero has to be cool unless really really angry  but thurman has her ragemeter pushed to the max from beginning to the end of this film and it gets awful tiresome after a while wish they had brought over sue shiomi for this onefinally a word about the sequel ii and the word is bad worse sequel to a good film i can rememberbut this first film is a lotta fun,cruel
enough good cant be said about although ive never agreed in the past with quentin tarantinos style of filmmaking this movie proves that he knows what hes doing however i do hope that anything he does in the future resembles the first rather than any other of his movies is by far the most stylish movie ever made even though it is so extremely violent first class filmmaking has portrayed it in a very acceptable way dont doubt it just watch it the final chapter in the house of blue leaves is itself worth watching the entire movie for over and over again vol 2 wasnt anything like this but was still good yet i prefer the first volume any day,cruel
comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead the mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there however an ancient proverb states that if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living then woe betide those who put it there such is the premise of once part of an elite group of world wide assassins bb the victim uma thurman awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her throughout the rest of the film viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the worlds most venomous snakes not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered  black manba as bb was code named the deadliest snake goes after each of the assassins it has been suggested were bruce lee to have lived this vehicle would have been his instead the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action director quinton tarentino from the first to the last exciting subplots and wellchoreographed martial arts scenes give this film its special quality the main target of bbs revenge is of course none other than master kung fu david carradine as bill it is he and his snake team which consists of lucy liu who plays oren ishii vivica a fox as vernita green daryl hannah as elle driver and michael madson who now become the intended targets interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action in the end what can be said of one if this film is fantastic i cant wait for part ii of which there is excellent ,cruel
so what have we in this movie a simple and rather silly plot and lots and lots of blood normally this would spell disaster but when tarantino directs you know you can expect good things and thats exactly what you getthis movie has a lot of style and its style that drives it and style that builds it the plot revolves around the bride her name bleeped out in this movie once a member of the deadly viper assassination squad codenamed black mamba but she leaves her boss and boyfriend bill to marry somebody else bill is upset and kills everybody who attended the wedding and has his squad beat the pregnant bride into a pulp before shooting her in the head only a second after she informs bill the baby is his she wakes up four years later bent on revenge and from there on the movie is about her vendetta going through the squad before getting to bill the movie opens with a battle against vernita green aka copperhead but the main villain in this movie is oren ishii codenamed cottonmouth and now the boss of the yakuza uma thurman as the bride and lucy liu as oren are magnificent and give strong performances as does sonny chiba as the retired japanese sword smith hattori hanzo but the true focus in this movie is not the amazing acting but the amazing battle scene bloody yet amusing quick and stylish and accompanied by a magnificent soundtrackyou will enjoy watching this movie because it is entertaining and nothing more but therein lies its charm and a certain revelation at the end of the movie will make you ache to watch vol 2,cruel
i keep waiting for tarantino to stumble but he hasnt disappointed me yet the first installment of is sensational from start to finish and shouldnt disappoint anyone who expects tarantino to meet the bar he set with pulp fiction and jackie brown i dont know if theres another director out there who can borrow so heavily from other movies and directors yet make such original and unique works of filmthe comments here at imdb on number in the thousands so theres no need for me to mention the plot or even any of what makes this film so hugely entertaining i just wanted to add my voice to those who love this movie if youre a movie buff i dont see how you could come away from this film anything but dazzled since if nothing else is a joyous celebration of movies at their most eager desire to entertainan energetic startling vivid funny and at times surprisingly beautiful moviegrade a,cruel

this movie to me was the best movie i have ever seen i quote it everyday the script is magnificent and the camera shots are brilliant the characters are well developed and quentin t couldnt have chosen a better cast it is pure genius with all the references to other movies the plot is detailed and superb i love that he used his own car in the movie as well the 2nd movie in the series matches just as well in content possibly foreshadowing a 3rd movie in which vernita greens daughter nikki will perhaps face off with beatrix kiddos daughter bebe that would be an amazing trilogy in which case i would watch it as soon as it came out however it has been so long since the last movie i fear quentin has given up on the third movie idea lets hope for the best and all you ers out there can sympathize with me in my longing for the 3rd,cruel
there is no dialog like the one in pulp fiction or reservoir dogs there is lots of quentin trademarks but its done so badly that it looks like a knock off the soundtrack is okay  but its just not cool the actors have probably been instructed to play in cartoon 2d style to stay in the genre of martial art movies from the seventies  but is comes of boring i think of natural born killers as a good script and a bad director this film comes of as a bad idea and a director that is destroying his life with narcotics do fans of martial arts movie like this movie i think this comes of as a pretentious martial art movie and it leaves a bad stigma to the whole movie,cruel
the bride is on a path of revenge left for dead by her old colleges shes out for their lives after their failed attempt on her life she is left in a coma for four years after the massacre at the church in el paso soon as she wakes up she doesnt waste time her we are taken through her first two victims oren ishii and vernita green first on her list is oren ishii who has become queen of the tokoy underworld her second victim though first in the movie is vernita greenis another great film for director quentin tarantino quentin has dropped a lot of the heavy dialog that hes done in his other films and has replaced it with outstanding action is a patch work of film influences and references ranging from japanese samurai film the later half very heavy in this chinese martial arts animation spaghetti western and a range of others some parts are ripped right from other films but are given that tarantino feel though they range from all different sorts of cinema tarantino has done a great job and joining them all together to create his own world for this bloody tale the violence is vulgar and very bloody yet its very mesmerising there is a beauty to it that raises it beyond pointless violence the blood though does come by the truck load it flies everywhere the animation sequence of orens past sits so perfectly it doesnt seem out of place heightening the japanese influencethe action is nothing short of outstanding this has the best fight sequences in an action film the battle of the blue leaves blows the burly brawl from the matrix reloaded right out of the water its great to see that tarantino didnt rely on cgi for the fights making it all the more realistic they flow so well and are choreographed wonderfullythe fight between the bride and vernita though short is so fast paced and high in energyall the acting is perfect uma thurman is just brilliant as the bride you cant fake tears like she did when pulling herself into the back of bucks pussy wagon she brought so much dignity and malevolence to the bride lucy lui is so elegant and ruthless as oren its shocking how one minute she is laughing and smile then next she is chopping some guys head off without a second thought vivica a fox though not having a major role is very good as vernita sonny chiba is just hysterical as hattori hanzois violently beautiful darkly funny and has a soundtrack to die for bring on vol 2,cruel
i might have more regard for the movie if i didnt think tarantino accomplished more and was just simply deeper in his other filmstarantino the artist in my opinion was just a better overall communicator and creator in each of his other films i really dont think succeeds on any level as much as the others and im very surprised to see so many critics that are so seduced by tarantinos technical skill in the film which indisputably is substantial that they simply fail to see itin other words it plays to me like one of your lessliked episodes from your favorite tv show just not as strongfor example to me the funny moments werent funny in except for when the main character emerges and heads across the street in vol 2 i dont want to give anything away i thought that was brilliantly funnybut the guy who wont get the tea the want some coffee thing other moments meant to be funny just didnt work certainly not in the way that they did in reservoir dogs youre gonna be okaaaaaay pulp fiction royale with cheese ha ha or jackie brown killer had a 45 they want a 45 from a technical standpoint many of the action sequences are fast and wellcrafted and etc theres much more that has to make any artistic creation resonate and work thoughthere are so many things that happen in the movie that arent realistic from a character or plot standpoint and no im not even talking about the violence i dont want to give away details for people who havent seen the movies but there are so many times when characters showed no reaction to something quite surprising happening in the story they just fought out their wellchoreographed wellshot welledited fight scene that was scheduled for that day and it feels like iti wouldnt have a problem with the violence if it didnt feel like it just came form someone who likes to see violence in movies if more of it had true dramatic motivation for being in there like say his other movies id be more understanding but so much of the time this just isnt the casethe example that comes most readily to mind is when thurmans trying to will her toes to move and her flashback somehow comes around to the anime sections involving the heartbreakingly disgusting and tragic murders of lucy lius characters parents from a character standpoint his is a major cheat thurmans character is in no position to know this obviously she doesnt know it but it was a convenient place to put in background about lucy lius character the scene itself to me doesnt play with any authentic dramatic weight its just hey major anime bloodbath awesome lets just make it as horrendous as possible stuffit feels like much of the time tarantino ratcheted up the shockometer which is much easier and less respectable than reaching for deeper and more artistically valuable details and plot developmentssome people enjoy this kind of thing for someone who likes movies for their storytelling creative and dramatic potentials its nothing short of revolting and upsettingi thought thurman was amazing and i thought the crazy 88s demise and the aftermath was pretty funnyi thought the very opening was the no 1 most gripping introduction id ever seen in a film everbut i dont think the rest of the film lives up to it,cruel
i always love tarantinos choice of music this film sounds great it also looks slick with beautiful people posing around the screen in cool outfits and thats about it i loved pulp fiction and jackie brown for many reasons including their cool understatement balanced by occasional way overthetop excess these are the cinematic equivalents of quantum theory and the sidney opera house is the cinematic equivalent of a fashion show of polished and posing airheadsonly with lots of blood dont waste your money unless that sounds appealing i wont see volume 2 since i suspect it is more of the same,cruel
it took me a long time to get around to partly because im not a huge fan of martial arts movies and partly because i find qts elevation to moviegod status a little premature there is a lot to like in this film the photography is excellent the cast is strong and the story is quirky however tarantino has got carried away with his homage to asian movies and japanese comics the plot is just too silly and its quite unbelievable that none of the 88s pull a gun on the bride stuff the swordplay  bodyguards should kill to protect without worrying about honour qt is also clearly fixated on blood he started with pools of it in reservoir dogs now were treated to huge fountains and lakes it reminded me immediately of the black knight sequence in the holy grail or the other python sketch anyone for tennis how can sophie survive after losing so much blood so quickly the cast uma thurman looks as fabulous as ever and delivers lines and moves with aplomb and i really enjoyed lucy liu as an evil gang boss daryl hannah doesnt feature enough in vol1 to judge nor carradine vivica fox is effective in her brief segment although who in the hell would stop a fight to the death and drink a coffee because a kid comes home anyway she didnt write the script so cant blame her for that best moment the fight between the bride and oren ishii in the snow with the bamboo water holder tipping metronomically in the background i will watch vol 2 because im interested to find out the rest of the story plus qt films are always worth at least one viewing but i certainly wont bother to see either part twice this is definitely not his best work by the way is it just me or is it pretentious to put in the titles quentin tarantinos 4th film i would love to see him apply his undoubted talents to more serious and substantial screenplays maybe he could have a go at an historical epic to start off with,cruel
there will be many people who will hate me for what i am about to say but here goes i went into volume 1 excited quentin tarantino has made some amazing films reservoir dogs and pulp fiction still blow me away today now after watching this new movie from qt i left the theater feeling undeniably disappointedfirst of all is arguably one of the most stylish movies to be released in 2003 i mean seriously the film has imagery to die for the fight sequences are spectacularly choreographed exciting and ludicrously violent an homage to kungfu films the set decoration is awesome loved the house of blue leaves umas tracksuit is killer also an homage this time to bruce lee and the cinematography is gleefully kinetic the soundtrack also brings down the house and is one i would consider adding to my cd collectionthat being said is beautiful yet there is the ageold truth that looks only go so farwhat many people seem to dislike for is the absurdity of the gory violence for they feel it takes away from the seriousness of the film it has been said many times by tarantino himself that is an homage to the grindhouse films of the 70s and the magnitude of the violence is intentional in other words it fits the style of the film and again the style is really something but after awhile the awe and shock of the yellow tracksuits and severed limbs begins to wear off and it becomes apparent that beneath all the excess of the film there is not a core as in pulp fiction but a hollow void uma thurmans character is passionately vengeful and she makes the best of what she is given but besides being wronged by bill and the deadly vipers there is barely any depth to her the film moves far too quickly to feel a genuine attachment to the bride yes she is put through hell and therefore we feel sorry for her yet our relationship with her never quite reaches a level beyond that and because of the latter felt very empty to me in the end i can see why it is rated so highly though because its easy to win over an audience with style which is what is all about this is only my opinion others may disagree with me sure the film is an homage to past movies but that doesnt give it greatness nor does style the most revered and expertly crafted movies have all offered something similar a story with emotional depth and complexity that goes beyond the standard hollywood fare it saddens me to see that quentin tarantino has sunken to a lower standard after all he is praised for his script writing from previous films i remember when i saw the first trailer for a subtitle read miramax presentsthe fourth film by quentin tarantino i rest my case,cruel
first id like to precise that i loved pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but i can not stand the fact that almost everybody agrees to see in this movie a masterpiece as for me it is a good action movie and i recognize that tarentino is an excellent dj yes a dj because he mixed very well different styles  hong kong kungfu italian western japanese movie when i heard tarentino himself saying he wanted and succeeded according to him to make the best fighting scene of all time i thought this man hast lost sense of reality to conclude a good action movie but with a lot of dejavu scenes,cruel
i just saw vol 1 for the first time and i am not impressed to me it wasnt tarantinos best work at all i thought that a lot of the dialogue was weak and not nearly as quick creative and original as we are used to most tarantino scripts and dialogues being for instance watch this movie and then watch dogs pulp and true romancewhich he wrote and listen to how much better the dialogue is in those films as opposed to the fighting of course was great and the music was what really held the film together quentin stayed true to his eye of matching music to the scene very well im not saying that it was a bad movie but i just wasnt impressed i havent seen vol 2 yet but i hope that michael madsen has some more lines and face time in it because some of the things that flew out of his mouth in reservoir dogs were great and he is a true tarantino actor i hope that for quentins next movie he goes back to those wild ideas that he had in pulp and dogs instead of this kung fu st overall i give this movie a 610,cruel
whoever told tarantino that he was a movie director is the same person who told ms cleo that she was a psychic im firmly convinced that the man cant make a movie worth the film its printed onhis latest outing is an homage cough cough to old kung fu movies of the seventies but this movie lacks the simplistic charm that old martial arts movies had insofar that is a poor bastardization of seventies filmsnow while this film is 200 times better than the sewer slime known as pulp fiction i feel that i must confess that i do like the action and the conflict in the film however the script was not driven by the actors in the film and character development was poor there were many times that i felt that the violence was being gratuitous and the lawn sprinkler effects of the gushing blood was very laughable at bestuma thurman gave a very shallow performance in this movie as well and maybe that helped her character a bit but it didnt make the bride compelling and i find it very hard to believe that thurman could take out the entire yakuza in a restaurant when she couldnt take out alicia silverstone in batman  robin which is also better than pulp fiction not to mention that she has very ugly feet ugghhhall in all about 5050 in my book i will say that it may be worth a watch and eventually when the dvd is in the 550 bin at walmart maybe even worth a purchase if you like tarantino films you may like this film otherwise approach with caution510 stars,cruel
now where do i start  i am often amazed at the hysteria generated by a movie made by tarantino  granted pulp fiction was a decent effort in a confused disjointed way  but volume one needs to be taken with an almighty pinch of salt  if this film was made by golden harvest in hong kong it would never have seen the light of day in western theatresi was impressed with the standard of martial arts in the first fight scene when our heroine bride fights to the death against vernita green  but the whole film lost the plot for me after that scene with its chopping backwards and forwards  and the main fight scene in the nightclub when the bride takes on over 100 screaming samurai welding gangsters beckons beliefi understand this is a tribute to martial art films of the 70s and should in no way be taken seriously but it is possible to have believable martial arts and still have a solid story  i have always loved martial arts and i have studied taekwondo for many years  so i guess with a heavy heart i must give this film the thumbs down,cruel
the fighting scenes were slow and boring especially uma she looked all lanky and unnatural it was just funny watching herqt thought he could get away with it by having her cut someones arm off now and againthe last fight scene with lucy lu what was that it was nothing just two uncoordinated women looking at each other for too longi was hoping uma dies throughout the whole film because u dont care for her at all if your going to have a basic plot the action has to be great and the characters likable it wasnt they werentthe line where uma says something like she looks like shes wearing something from a star trek movie summed it up for me qt a geek and a joke i cant wait for his war movie maybe he will make some more star trek references,cruel
i have come to the conclusion after reading numerous reviews and comments on that you either love it or you cant stand it  i still havent decided where i stand yet  at first i was leaning towards the what the hell is the point of this movie side  however now that i have watched it i recognize why it is regarded so well by many and have developed some respect for it  but i still dont like it yet      if this film was not directed by the admiral to many quentin tarantino it would most likely not demand the same respect and praise from viewers  however quentin makes it clear to all that he is the director and that this is 4th film by posting this is in the credits several times and on the cover of the film i was a little confused while i was watching  the action sequences seemed to be like something out of a pg13 jackie chan movie but body parts and limbs were actually being cut off in the action scenes unlike the pg13 jackie chan movies or their equivalents  does this brutality make a masterpiece because unlike the other martial arts films limbs are being dismembered with what seems like a never ending supply of red liquid representing blood      i dont know the answer to that question  i give this film a 5 out of 10  i respect the originality and unique universe created by but i dont fully understand it and why others praise so much  i give it a middle of the road 5 because i disagree with those who dis the film as having pointless brutal action scenes and little merit  but i also do not share the passion and obsession that some people have with the film,cruel
when my wife  i sat down to watch this film we knew quentin tarantinos style and past films this film though was definitely the worst we have seen in a long time the plot oops was there a plot is none existent it is purely a film based on a gratuitously violent video game blood spurting limbs flying  lets just say we were not amused impressed or enlightened by our viewing the only  i mean only reason we actually finished watching the film was that we thought wrongly that it had to get better i would rather have spent the 2 hrs that the film took to watch having my genitalia pierced something that i would loath doing therefore in my humble opinion you would be better to sit and watch a blank screen than waste your money on renting or buying this film,cruel
you know i usually decide what movie to watch according to the rating of this site consequently when i started to watch this piece of well i dont mean exactly art i felt like there had been some mistake but there wasnt any except that it hadnt got a single academy award nomination good they still havent lost it its not because of the violent scenes which are of no use however except for those legion of sick people who worship all that its that the whole film is pointless with a nonsense script boring boring boring if youre still a normal person in this weird world take my advice do not waste your timemoney by the way tarantinos pulp fiction was one of the best movies ever made but seems this guy thinks he can walk on the water,cruel
dont get me wrong i think of a 9 of 10 as pretty high praise but its no 77 on the top 250 that kind of rating should be for films which are about something more than live action anime tarintino does do a wonderful job at capturing and honoring the mood of todays violent cartoons and yesteryears bmovies and those recurring gushers of blood are hilarious in a yeah im sick but it sure can be entertaining sort of way tarintino also does a credible job incorporating a great variety of styles and approaches to the material but the films continuous winking at itself telegraphs that the plot is secondary and you end up wondering how much of the film is tarintino and how much is second unit directors and stunt coordinators also and this may be me and my watching matrix ii and blade ii all in the same weekend but im awful tired of scenes where a horde of attackers supposed there to assail the main character take their turns politely waiting to get their butts kicked instead of just zooming in and dispatching the heros ass like they should oh quentin if you could put this much love into something that really mattered  sigh,cruel
okay what was the whole point of this movie was it really to go kill everyone to get revenge on based on the fact that they killed her i dont even know the first characters name due to the lack of umm plotnow i know ill probably have some people come in here and say omg this movie rocked or here we go again another person posting about how they didnt like it however for anyone that has seen a real martial arts movie with some truth to it kiss of the dragon enter the dragon bruce lee story green hornet tai chi master i dunno i was kinding expecting a little more seriousness to this1 how do you bleed that much when your arm gets chopped off 2 how does a trained assassin miss shooting uma at the beginning 3 the whole vaseline screwing uma in coma scene is just sick im sorry 4 nice final fight scene that was the most pathetic ive ever seen 5 justify the spraying blood it may work in animes didnt work here 6 another lame scene where they have the chance to kill her but then for some stupid reason bill says no dont wtf 7 killing 88 men that way huh go watch jet li in kotd and look how it might really be donethis was a movie that had great potential i did like some things who else wouldve thought that this movie wouldve been great had they just made it serious they couldve totally had a great martial arts movie being that i thought uma thurman did a great job this just seems like a movie that interests little high school kids and stoneddrunkfailing college kids on the weekends oh wellhave fun replying bashing or discussing this lol,cruel
is it goodid say it deserves a fair rating nothing that would traumatize you too much but not something you couldnt live without seeing like someone else said it seems that tarantino has a weakness for references to other films and here it is very apparent one neednt be that much of a kurosawa or 70s hk film fan to see the references if bill didnt have the homage as its skeleton it wouldve been more interesting even tarantinos own films are referenced hereand the characters i found the villains more interestinguma thurman cannot carry a movie on her own plainly no charisma her character if anything is straightforward shes out to kill some people we never find out exactly why her wedding was hit though it has to be said that it was by the most impractical group of assasins in movie history their follies appearing especially at the big fight scene towards the end i mean all those welldressed thugs mustve been able to afford an uzi or something swords in the 21st century maybe in the period yojimbo was set in it would make sense i dont think anyone without the assistance of speed is talented enough to fight off nearly 100 people with a swordanyway the villains were a lot cooler than umai actually felt sad when she killed that oren chick i mean she was so cool and her little entourage toothey were characters you dont want to mess with but in some quiet way adoreoverall productionwise its very cool and trendy storywise blah maybe im in a minority but i like stories pulp fiction was a good story and it had weird witty dialoguethere wasnt any here unfortuneately,cruel
first of all let me say i am ashamed at myself for wasting 5 minutes of my life which i will never get back writing about a tarantino moviei am an obsessive moviegoer  i live and breathe movies and consider myself to be a bit of a connoisseur  i like to think i know a good movie when i see it and a good director when i see his or her workto say tarantino is a talented director is equivalent to saying britney spears is a talented recording artist  its all smoke and mirrors unfortunately a lot of the population has been fooled and these untalented individuals are making a lot of moneyenough tarantino bashing time to bash his movie  vol i dont expect a review of volume ii there wont be one is quite possibly the most ridiculous unashamedly bad movie of our time i didnt think it could get any worse than from dusk till dawn but it did  i have to give tarantino some credit he has totally brainwashed a large majority of the worlds population into believing he has talent  if you rate vol 1 more than a 00001 out of 10 you should consider increasing your medication  if you do not welcome to the world of sensible peopleuma thurman you may have gargantuan hands and feet but i love you  stop wasting the talent god gave you on tarantino movies,cruel
i am not a huge fan of tarantino but i have enjoyed some of his earlier works  however one of my friends raved about this film so i was looking forward to iti have no problem with the lack of plot in the film  one of my favourite movie of all time is battle royale which has even less plot  however i do have a problem with the mixed genreswhile a fan of the genres that the movie is derived from i felt the end result of the film is a jumbled mess  massive blood sprays may look fine in anime but in this movie it is distracting and unecessary also uma thurman is not an actor  she has one character that she plays in all her movies  basically she always plays a pouty little btch  i dont know if shes like that in real life but id like to see her stretch herself  even someone like harrison ford who admits he is no actor moved away from his typecast in the mosquito coastof course this is only my opinion and i seem to be in the minority but i really had to force myself to finish watching this onemy rating 3  10,cruel
not coolthere is power in things that are implicit and when portrayed artfully more powerful then things explicitthere is no reason for all the gross violence in this movie and its largely unattractive  explicitly showing violence especially constantly throughout a film is a serious copouti dont particularly find that artistic entertaining or shocking more than i find it largely discomforting and somewhat insultingi dont care about the gushing blood or even the flying limbs  fine but this movie was just grossin order for a director to be able to pull off such a bold depiction of violence there would have to be a largely substantial plot to back this upthere was none  the movie was about fighting people  thats all  the action sequences had at least 100 times more content then the storyline youd think this would make for a very intense movie  yes it is intense but not captivating  i love being uncomfortable when watching a movie  its great that means youre involved in it  but this movie made me uncomfortable in a way that i didnt want to continue watching itperhaps that was the intention  fine  i just dont like paying money to watch people get murdered  its boring and a total copout  well not a total copout civilians werent pointlessly killed which is goodother then that the movie was very stunning visually  it was definately a treat to watch in that regard  that really long steadycam shot which started out in a restaurant and followed uma through the entire building then back to the same spot that was fantasticbut the whole movie was plastic fake utterly pointless and well  annoying,cruel
 some spoilers in this review dont believe the undue hype surrounding this moviewhy it has many good aspects you may say tarantino yuen wo ping choreography umawell it may have these aspects and the fight choreography is excellent but a film does actually require things like plot character and script this movie is sadly lacking in all three yes there may be a whole heap of cool references ott fight action and extreme violence but without a grounding a film without a frameworkdoes anybody care about this bride character not really after all we all know there is a followup movieah you again may say willing suspension of disbelief is required but how can you believe in a film which makes no attempt to justify its own reality in the matrix films for example the characters were capable of such incredible kungfu because they had disconnected from the artificial real world we live in and were able to bend realitycan uma thurman do this apparently she is able to defeat forty men perform impossible acrobatics and be virtually indestructable how you tell metarantinos obsession with base topics  rape murder contract killingseven peodophillia in the anime section of the movie  are also on show there is just no contrast in this film no light and dark spoiler when uma kills one of her rivals in front of her young daughter there seems to be little reaction a total lack of humanity pervades the moviecomic book stylings  would be your exasperated reply yet even comicbook tales have pathos and emotion superman doesnt coldbloodedly kill lex luthor then rape lois lane does hesure tarantino is talented at what he does all his directorial flair conjures up great camera angles and clever editing but as a great movie i dont think so,cruel
first i must say im a fan of qt i loved reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown and true romancethis movie has nothing to do with qt movies sure it has some qt trademarks like red apple sigarettes and the long shot and the trunk  shot but the rest is bullsht no great dialogues way too much music no story bad names of the characters and bad charactersit looks to me like somekind of mtv alternative song to song and some quick action just like the average music video except the naked chicks and bling bling shtuma did some bad acting here it looks like shes switching characters during the different scenes shy then sober then totally blinded by anger and the narrator is not funny or whatever it suppose to be it all does not fitthe fight scenes are fun but not more than that not exciting or specialthen the ending whooah looks like your daily soap cliffhangeri prefer ichi the killer battle royale and zaitogy spelling blabla,cruel
how a talented director with a huge budget a capable crew and an obvious appreciation for classic martial arts films could make such an incredibly awkward and uninteresting adaptation of them a stylish uneven pastiche of hong kong bmovies japanese samurai traditions and other incongruous cinematic parts  obligatory spoiler warning  to be clear i do get this movie even though volume 1 is obviously intended for a niche audience  i was not disgusted by the flamboyantly violent scenes of spurting fake blood and severed limbs and the continuous references to action films of the 60s and 70s were not lost on me  the thin revenge plot stale characters and stilted dialog are at least excusable since the lowbudget kung fu films that tarantino apparently tried to emulate were rarely more polishedfor all its colorful sets and costumes some creative camera angles and a unique soundtrack volume 1 will probably seem relatively boring to anyone who does not have a creepy little shrine dedicated to tarantino in their closetthe uninspired casting editing or lack thereof and stunningly dull fight choreography are painfully obvious throughout  uma thurman is miscast as the vengeful unnamed assassin she butchered her japanese lines why was she given so many of them and looked ridiculous when she fought swinging a katana like a flyswatter with one hand  with the exception of one brief scene featuring a chainwielding psychotic schoolgirl the action sequences are repetitive various body parts are chopped off blood spurts out like a fountain maybe i am just too old and jaded to find that amusing or entertaining for more than five minutes  the nonsequential storyline serves no apparent purpose it does however manage to drain any suspense from the final scene and the pacing was slow a tedious sonny chiba cameo set in okinawa a pointlessly gross rape subplot at the hospital a seemingly endless example of tarantinos strange obsession with thurmans feet thank you quentin for subjecting me to thathalf of a needlessly long overhyped martial arts movie 210,cruel
so tarantino wanted to pay an homage to kungfu films and hong kong action cinema  well he triedand failed  for a kungfu film it sure is missing quite a bit of kungfuin fact it doesnt have any kungfu  the only martial arts in this movie is a poor display of japanese swordsmanship and thats being generous  its actually a white chick holding a samurai sword swinging it wildly occasionally while being surrounded by talented actormartial artists like sonny chiba and gordon lui  tarantino completely wasted the talents of yuen woo ping by putting an uncoordinated sloth in the title roll and yes it is a kungfu film every interview tarantino does he calls it a kungfu flick  so based on this he completely and utterly failed in crafting an engaging and creative martial arts genre filmnot only that but tarantino took a complete and inaccurate dump all over yakuza society  and no wiggle your big toe is not the least bit funny no a few cheesy fountains of blood does not make this film totally violent if you gorehounds out there want cheesy gore go watch versus or ichi  the killer and then get back to meby the way the character of go go was completely bitten from chiaki kuriyamas character in battle royalein fact he rips off an entire scene from that filmgood job tarantino,cruel
what can i say im no tarentino fan thats becoming more obvious for every movie but this one contains all the parts i usually dislike in a tarentino flick its not completely rotten but at best it was uninspiring and downright boring the 70s ninjaflick heritage was there along with the exaggerated sound effects but thats hardly original the rest of the storytelling was a strange mix of the usual tarentinolike reshuffled chronology accompanied by pretty bad music which was a dissapointment i expected better but i guess its very much a matter of taste and that familiar cartoon style which you either love or hate last seen in animatrix the big fight in black  white was a dissapointment it was remarkably unremarkable uma thurmans performance was also varying in quality from very good to rather theatrically silly but i suspect that tarentinos sometimes overambitious dialogue makes it feel unnaturalall in all it had its few moments but in the end it was just the disappointment i expected,cruel
what a bore  this film is nothing but a cheap ripoff of hong kong martial arts films and japanese samurai movies  i love kung fu movies which is why was such a disappointment  instead of making a film with great fighters and great fight scene the director used humdrum hollywood actors with no stagefighting ability and then used quick takes and cuts to compensatesave your 9 and go rent once upon a time in china if you want to see great fighting,cruel
before i went to the cinema and watch it i didnt expect much but i was more than sure that it would have many thrills and good action scenes in the first few minutes i was watching with great interest some good fight scenes some anachronisms and hope that these good actors will pull something good out of this later on i realized that tarantino wished to make a manga style movie not only from the actual manga cartoon that were added in the movie which i didnt mind at all cause i really enjoy cartoon or comic feeling in a movie what i watched afterwards though had nothing to do with mangas or anything similar but more like a cheap imitation of them too many idiotic dialogues plus fight scenes with extreme duration and totally simplistic made it a very low quality film comparing to what i originally expect which wasnt too much anyway my opinion avoid my grade 310,cruel
it just didnt deliver what i hoped it would i may have had a bad moviedayit just seemed too much of a ripoff from asian cinema  flybywire kung fu and japanese bloodspurting ultraviolence  if i want those two ill just fire up an authentic chinese flic or a japanese onebut it had a few redeeming features i suppose ill just have to think about somei feel generous the beginning wasnt too bad so it gets 5 out of 10,cruel
this movie is hipwith all the mangaanime japanese and martial arts being so in this movie was bound to be rated good but it isnt  that is if you dont care for whack and smack with cool anime and samurai sword hype im not a tarantino fan nor do i dislike his movies but this sure did make me want to walk out on it ok  beautiful in a sense utter bs plot characters are well bseven the assassin squad name made me want to toss it action scenes are repetitious as is all the violence imho rides on quentins name period hear the sheep flockrecommended for animemanga buffs martial arts buffs thats about it cant recommend it to others perhaps for film students as it does have some nice scenes3 out of 10,cruel
i cannot express in words how great this movie was if you havent seen it yet then go do it now before it is out of theaters if you are planning on killing yourself go see this and it will make you feel alot better and you will want to live so you can see the second part trust me this movie is god,cruel
a film that gives so much respect to the japanese samurai films and the leone spaghetti westerns so i was always going to like it its no reservoir dogs or pulp fiction but its the most energetic output in 2003big bold brash and funny a funky soundtrack to match and thurman lights up the screen,cruel
i went to see volume 1 this afternoon and wow  i was amazed it has to be tarantinos best film so far  the camera angles the awesome music choice the brilliant acting  it left us on a cliffhanger just asking for more more carnage more blood more revenge we want her to  quentin tarantino you are an inspiration to us allhis first coming  reservoir dogs  brillianthis second film   pulp fiction  amazinghis third story   jackie brown  unbelievablethe fourth film    the best so far we want morecoming soon   inglorious bs  ,cruel
a film with a simple plot taken to new heights making you get into the film from the very first black and white shot of uma thurman bloody and dying on the floor followed by a gunshot and the well placed song bang bang my comment on it being the best film of the new millenium is true over the past four years the market has been invaded with horribly made preteen flicks and movies that wouldnt hold you on the edge of your seat if your life depended on it even the academy awards has sunk to nominations of depressingly bad films but this is a breakthrough with some of the greatest cinematography scince the shawshank redemption or even citizen kane and characters that in any other film would be cartoony and unbelieved are believable because of tarantinos geniuseven the chief opposing characters are somewhat cared for in this movie plus an actual good cliffhanger unlike the horribly written ending of the matrix reloadedto be concluded but then again its not for everyone dont bring your kids to it and if your looking for another pulp fiction well you might be dissapointed not saying that its bad just its not the same style a 10 and possibly even 11,cruel
cheesy dialogue that just didnt do it for me cross some scenes are really funny tick animation part was cleverly done so kudos points for that tick clever direction 2 ticks but most importantly ii felt in absoultely no rush to see the second one ii i walked out of the cinema knowing that for 10 bucks i could have bought pulp fiction from ebay,cruel
quentin tarantino took several well known scenes out of movies and reworked them into at times i thought i was watching whats up tiger lily the spoof by woody allen with a spaghetti western soundtrack what a genius,cruel
what a disappointing movie experience 2 hours wasted i had a bad feeling when i found out this is a kungfu movie i dont like kungfu movies but with qt at the helm i couldnt say no to this movie well i blew it this movie sucked and when the blood started spraying i laughed out loud it was sam peckinpahs tea garden party skit from monty python all over again seems im in the minority when it comes to this farce but i felt ripped off,cruel
this is a movie filled with twodimensional characters and a plot out of a late night movie starring shannon tweedlets be honest if tarantinos name wasnt attached to this project it would go nowhere sure the fight sequences are incredible especially in the japanese garden but where the hell is the scriptone of tarantinos trademarks has been his dialogue in fact it was his skills in this regard that got him patchup work in movies like crimson tide another subpar movie save tarantinos little silver surfer diatribe so where is it in someone should remind mr tarantino that he should get back to making characters heroes or antiheroes worth caring abouta strong recommendation for this movie to those who do not feel characters and plot are necessary in a movie410,cruel
you may think that im just a tarantino rookie and i am but i did go into the movie expecting a whole lot of graphic violence well i did see a whole lot of graphic violence but i didnt see the amazing plot i had been promisedrevenge is nice and all but there was no story whatsoever the movie was tied together by the violence it was one violent scene after another after anotherthe movie was not without merit it had excellent choreography in the fight scenes the acting wasnt so bad and there was excellently placed comic relief just when it was needed so it was well directedi just dont think you can put revolting plot items weak plot items and graphically violent plot items together and call it a fivestar movie,cruel
come on its just a dumb movie there are hundreds of kung fu movies from asia much much better than just because its in hollywood format doesnt mean its great or a masterpiece really weak movie if you got a brain dont go see it,cruel
i was so looking forward to this after all the hype and buildup  and unfortunately it sucked on pretty much every level  there was no fast paced witty dialogue no characterisation and no narrative drive which is what ive always loved from tarantino if you dont have any interesting or involving dialogue at least let the gore splatter in colour,cruel
warning heavy spoilerslet me begin by stating the positive aspects of the film the gore the cinematography the anime sequence and the tarantinoesque style make vol 1 an enjoyable experiencehowever the dialogue is utterly laughably not in the good tongueincheek way it was intended even steven im buck and i come to f silly rabbit trix are for kidsare these supposed to be great quotes this pales in comparison to the dialogue tarantino is known for this especially sad because kung fu dialogue can be so deliciously cheesy yet here its just sadlucy liu is not a good actress her monologue after decapitating the japanese racialist in her clan was a cheap attempt at understatement and situational irony lucy liu is also crosseyed so why are there so many closeups of her faceuma thurman did not do any notable kung fu moves the wire wasnt very well done because you can tell exactly when the wire begins to influence movement this resembles the bad wirework of the tuxedo i cringed at every time uma thurman tried to sound toughthe move your big toe was pointless it seemed to last forever it is also a huge plothole that she would have been able to camp out in the car of buck who she just killed for that long without being discovered by the police thats ridiculously implausible and reeks of lazy writing staring at uma thurmans crooked and badly manicured toes for 10 minutes is also beyond excessive this should have been cutis packed with plot holes uma thurman driving the pssy wagon the car of a man she just slaughtered without being discovered by the police is one example yeah right you know hardworking writers would have organized the script in a manner where such obvious holes would have been avoided sorry but tarantino telling the public ahead of time that takes place in a parallel universe where police doesnt exist is a cheap tactic you might as well start giving excuses for plot holes in other movies and dont start telling me that its a kung fu parody and is not supposed to be taken seriously because if it were just another kung fu parody then it wouldnt be getting 4 out of 4s on so many film forums isnt kung pow it doesnt deserve these sort of plot holes nor will it get away with the screenwriters cheap entertainment tonightcrap press releasesvol 1 suffers from a lack of exposition okay what do we know about the bride she was beaten up pretty badly and killed thats all we know this makes it impossible to cheer her on as she dismembers her former colleagues tarantino also insists on making the baddies as cool and idiosyncratically appealing as possible so we are left watching the movie saying cool theres so much blood and guts but we dont get the rush of empathic energy that we got with movies like payback and taxi drivertarantinos tired nonlinear screenplay is a major flaw at first i thought that uma kills vivica a fox first today my friend informed me that the foxslaying takes place after umas scalping of lucy liu as indicated by her stupidly superfluous notepad sigh if her notepad had not been there to inform us of tarantinos oh so brilliant storytelling style we would have never known that her murder of vivica a fox takes place after her trip to japan in fact it makes more sense to have had her kill fox first why go to japan and deal with the yakuza right after being released when you can just go to foxs house in the united states uma goes to japan and comes back and is still driving the pssy wagon give me a break this nonlinear style serves no purpose at all other than to give an excuse for tarantinos obsession with keeping the brides history out of the first half of the moviesthe black and white shift during the crazy 88 fight scene was not needed is there any point to this or is quentin just trying to make his film look more artsy something it definitely is not the films major asset is the gore therefore it is unreasonable to cut down on almost 50 of the films potential gorethere is no mention of the brides possible venereal diseases after being raped repeatedly by various urchins while she was in a coma for all we know she could be hiv  this would have made us sympathize and cheer for umas character it would have also made the film realistic and proven to be a huge step in the portrayal of the hiv in filmquentin tarantino is plagued by culture confusion syndrome sorry but anyone who knows anything about the histories and cultures of china and japan knows that they have almost nothing to do with each other culturally tarantinos blending of the samurai film with the kung fu film seems very racist unintentionally and ignorant i guess since they both have slant eyes than they must both be sort of similar right wrong this was really offensive the yakuza would never nominate a chineseblood as a leader they and the entire country of japan are known for being racialiststhe time of the split seemed like the middle of a long metrage this is not a good time for a split i felt cheated i have to pay twice to see one film im sure we could have cut many of the scenes but tarantino was probably too persistent weinstein made the wise financial decision that the film would flop if released as a 3 hour film but would make much more than expected if split released twice i cant blame him filmmaking is a business and they want their money but this is setting a precedent for all potentially long films the moment of the split was not wisely chosen perhaps no moment would have been suitable as the splitting point because the film was not initially conceived as a twovolume feature it reeks of cashgrabbing consumerduping though the marketing campaign for proved to be extremely disgusting as well only two other people in the theater knew that it was only half a movie vol 1 was advertised as its so nice when those filmmakers trick consumers out of their money isnt itbottom line vol 1 would have been nothing without the gore the gore made the film and will establish its legacy i had a good time despite the negatives therefore i would give a fresh tarantino has run out of ideas and is getting indolent with screenwriting therefore he is relying on spoofing films to create his films he peaked too early with pulp fiction and he does not have much to prove anymore hes just another guy trying to add more to his pile of dough see if you like cartoonish violence and pizazz avoid it if you dont,cruel
i have no outstanding memories of this film whatsoever there is uma in a yellow jacket well thats the poster what else my emotions remained wholly untouched and my intellect stayed in bed at some point in the crush to rip off the past surely you are supposed to do something clever and original no some modern point some latter day twist thats the deal isnt it i get the old stuff repackaged upgraded and given a bit of a shine a little irony a little sarcasm a new message from old ideas respect for your elders with the hip sounds of now sorry no deal this film delivers your own dvd collection and if you are a tarantino fan this statement is true back at you with little interesting added crouching tiger gave us strong women and male anxiety the matrix gave us some interesting questions about life mr tarantino gives us a tricksy cereal box when this sort of film gets made elsewhere one would expect on the stars to put in an over the top performance and make the film their own but i suspect that this isnt possible with mr tarantino sitting on the chair someone somewhere needed to tell somebody something maybe the audience canso if you plan to see this film buckle up for the ride then make sure you have a good film to watch afterwards to make the day worth while,cruel
ok so i just came back from watching and i must say i feel fooled by the great voting this movie has been given im a bigtime tarantinofan and i also like fightmovies shouldnt this film be perfect for me apparantly no this movie was a joke while watching this i got a the feeling i recognized this type of movie i had seen it before after a while i remembered hot shots this movie reminds of the hot shots movies with everything exagurated most of the fightingscenes was just ridicoulus this actress cant fight she can act but she cant fight like shes supposed to in this movie maybe the imdb team should add comedy as genre too cuz i was laughing my a of at many parts offcourse i was only laughing at times when the movie was supposed to be serious heres a list of the good and the bad things about this moviebad1 bad fight scenes though funny2 bad acting to bad for tarantino atleast3 stupid plot4 stupid characters with eyepatches and startrekoutfits5 boring i was actually on my way out of the theater 2 times6 unbeleavably bad title sounds like an indian cheefgood1 tarantino made it2 good soundtrack3 nice way of telling the story with chapters like a bookthe overall feeling i have regarding the rates of this movie is that people have been waiting so long for the genious tarantino to make a new movie that whatever he would give us they will rate high maybe they feel that this movie has to be good that its them who is the problem and not the movie in itself voting high and writing about how much of a masterpiece this movie is might make you people feel smart but in my eyes you just prove the opositepersonal rating 510 would have been 3 or less out of 10 but since its a work from tarantino i gave it a little higher,cruel
quentin tarantino like robert rodriguez and kevin smith was an outsider indie filmmaker who burst into hollywood like some breath of fresh air in the early 90s  ill never forget the thrill seeing reservoir dogs el mariachi or clerks for the first time   you almost ached for these guys to make more moviesall the more painful then to see what each has become  the latest example is vol 1  this mess of a film has buckets of blood seventies camp galore and intricately choreographed hongkong style fight scenes what it doesnt have is any soul or smarts  hipster hollywood has absorbed tarantino whole and hes become yet another slave to irony style and camp gone is his incredible dialogue and amazing timing replaced by severed limbs bad animation and long dumb speechesi understand this was supposed to be some kind of cartoonish homage to a bygone era of cheesy filmmaking but it just totally lacked originality  i didnt enjoy a single minute of though im sure its going to make lots of money  meanwhile ill be watching for the next tarantino,cruel
after the first ten or twenty gallons of blood ie after about ten minutes into the film it became somewhat repetitious  are there any real characters here amid the blood and action  are we really supposed to care about any of these people  totally aside from motivation  i know that tarantino doesnt explain everything in a linear fashion and perhaps part two contains the justification for anyone enduring the first part  but ill never know unless i read it somewherethis was an excellently made film  i only wish that i found some purpose in all the proficiency,cruel
wow what a disappointment this is what tarantino has been working on all this timei was completely underwhelmed by this violent pointless tripe seemingly i would be the ideal target audience for this flick  i have loved every other tarantino flick and am a hardcore devotee of asian action flicks maybe its because ive seen so many much better examples of hk and japanbased actioners but this just doesnt hold up to the films its supposedly an homage tothe film plays almost like someone trying to do a mocktarantino film the dialogue is stilted and overly ornate but none of the actors seem able to deliver it with the panache of sl jackson or pam grier the opening scene between uma thurman and vivica fox is especially poor not only does their banter fall completely flat but having uma murder vivica in full view of her daughter before weve been given any reason to root for her keeps you from ever really caring whether uma gets her revenge or not the scene seems to want to try to get laughs at points but ends on such a down note that it hangs over the rest of the flick and what was the point of that tackedon rape scene in the hospital the whole start of the flick leaves a bad taste in your mouththe flick is also filled with cliched tarantino touches from the disjointed time frame to the supposedly funny pussy wagon that uma drives around in but underneath all the glibness and blood theres none of the humanity and humor that made his previous characters come to life even though jules vince vega ordell and the rest were violent lowlifes we sort of connected with and almost rooted for them because we got to really know them through quentins sparkling dialogue scenes theres none of that here its all of the violence actually quite a bit more with none of the imagination or originality that set tarantino apart in the first placethere is some good stuff here dont get me wrong the climactic battle between uma and an army of swordwielding yakuza is nicely done and stylish and umas scenes with sonny chiba as the legendary swordmaker honda are fun but theres just so much brutality and pain that it overwhelms the somewhat limited good aspects of the film is a total triumph of style over substance and it is utterly devoid of 90 of what made tarantino stand out from his imitators in the first place if this didnt have his name and reputation attached to it it would be buried in the trashheap of failed action flicks by next weekendgo see so close or fulltime killer instead and see what quentin wishes he could be doing right now,cruel
ok lets get straight to the point this movie was not worth the money my husband paid for us to see it i am ready to give credit where credit is due i love the different styles that are used in the film but the blood got to be excessive after the first five minutes i watched the film with an open mind but found myself wondering how long was it really going to last please go see the movie during a matinee have a friend sneak you in or wait to rent it dont pay full price,cruel
is it possible for people to pull their to heads out of quentin tarantinos butt just long enough to realize that this movie was nothing more than a bad boring poorly executed jerk off i loved reservoir dogs and truly enjoyed pulp fiction but this movie is just bad for all this screaming about it being the most violent american movie ever made there was a serious shortage of violence  and what there was was too silly to be considered violent  jesus has anyone seen goodfellas or anything by scorcese  i went to see a super violent action film  i got neither the big fight at the end went on too long that it became a victim of itself and then had a seriously anticlimactic climaxas soon as it starts we sit through one boring scene that is completely useless into the next  the opening fight though people tout it as being cool is one badly acted waste of time that looks like they were making up the dialogue as they went along  from there on we get a heaping dose of what qt at his worst pointless scenes the rapist hospital workers  and what the hell was up with the cops at the wedding chapel boring scenes daryl hannah almost killing uma but then not doing it lame characters who cares about any of them  and why does lucy lu get so much attention  what about the rest of the assassins and some bad very bad anime ughone saving grace was gogoplease folks when someone that is touted as the golden boy of cool filmmaking decides to make a movie like this some one needs to pull their heads out of his ass and tell him it is a bad idea  otherwise how will he ever learn  avoid this actionless action film,cruel
i was so pumped up and excited before watching this flickoh after it was over my sis and i didnt want to say it to each otherthe movie was terrible ridiculous and a bit of a bore  i know its a two parter and its an homage to all those shaw brothers movies but can we get a little more on the character the bride  i mean what is the point of all this  why should i give a  about the uma thurman character  i really feel that is what a lot of movies lack now a days  i feel like movies are more eye candy than substance and just rush to the great action scenes without allowing the audience time to attach to a character  i mean i felt a little sympathetic with the lucy liu character because of that little anime on her characters background i kind of wished there was something like that for the bride i mean for the first 10 minutes she gets shot in the head and then shes knife fighting with vernita green  yeah we know shes on the war path for revenge but give me a chance to know the characterthat way the fighting scenes would be more than just fighting scenesmy favorite moment which some of you might find kind of weird is the transition between the anime to the bride when she says but first thing firstwiggle your big toe  that to me was classic qt i wish there more classic moments like that  i dont know why ppl are raving about this movieunless youre into flying limbs blood and goreperhaps the second part might bring more character development  at least i can say that the soundtrack is awesome  310,cruel
i cant believe what i am hearing every critic on this film says that this film is brilliant we have gone so low has a great story i admit but its far to much disgusting i know i shouldnt take this film to seriously but think that if the movie the matrix caused killings in school imagine what this film could do quentin tarantino should be locked away for making this sort of movies i just want people to know that loving this movie is just being sick,cruel
i dont understand all the high ratings and record revenues for this movie it is nothing more than 110 minutes of swordfighting spurting blood and silly dialog maybe i missed the point but i cant bring myself to rate this one any higher than a 3,cruel
despite the fact that the movie was really entertaining its another ripoff by qt personally i dont mind that qt borrow material from a bunch of other flick but the reason why i dont mind is because i know most of what belongs to other movies while ordinary people who goes to theater dont have such knowledge the worst rip off in history was reservoir dogs go watch city on fire youll understand and when qt made is next films he showed more respect but most of the people dont know these things i agree that this is tarantino style but i just think that he get too much credit for showing material already being used and he had a 55 million budget im saying this because when i was in line the guy in front of me said that he already saw it twice and he said that qt was a creative genius that he never saw a movie like this one bla bla bla anyway i guess  its just a cult movie for the masses,cruel
was this just a stupid martial arts flick  isnt qt supposed to make i dont know important movies that have say interesting characters and witty dialogue  while i admired the style of the movie and the fight scenes were great i really didnt sense a great deal of originality in itto any people that are leaning on the fence on this one i say dont go i know the professional reviewers are saying it is great but and i will always maintain this had this film not been quentin tarantinos 4th movie it would be passed by as just another kung fu flick  there is nothing memorable here picture the matrix without a storyif you love martial arts movies which are not my forte than i assume you will like this movie  however if you are looking for a movie that will make you think skip this one,cruel
 spoilers within  the sense that seeing left me with is that quentin tarantino is really trying he is trying hard wanting to bring us back to where we were after having seen pulp fiction for the first time he does not succeedsuccessful comic books and this is what aspires to be have something at the core and that is characters that no matter how over the top or unbelievable or both succeed in producing either a sense of sympathy for the heroes or disdain for the villains or as is the case in the best comic books for an example punisher sympathy for a main character that is really no better than the villainsthe problem with is that qt never manages to develop the characters from being more than stylized caricatures so we are supposed to feel sorry for the bride she conjures nothing more than indifference and perhaps a bit of boredom and lucy liu as the main villain qt seems more interested in having her in either extreme closeups or viewed in swirling camera angles surrounded by falling snow where we can really get a good view of her rather than at least minimally develop her characterbesides the flawed or rather inexistent character development another aspect of the movie that really bothered me was the pacing in many of the scenes and especially in the last showdown between uma thurman and lucy liu the fighting characters will inexplicably pause and look at eachother for what seem to be an eternity before after exchanging a few words go at it again i dont know if these pauses were put in there to build the mood or add suspense or simply to let us admire uma thurman and lucy liu posing in ninja positions this technique coupled with the constant breaks to the chapter x cut scenes leaves the movie feeling choppy and fragmentedso what is good about the movie uma thurman does a great job with what she has to work with the styling is slick but far from enough to save the movieyou know how it is when you go to see a movie that has looked pretty darn good in the trailer and afterwards you wish they would have made it a short about the length of the trailer because it contained was pretty much all the movie had to offer is not quite that bad but it is not that much better eitherlucy liu who i admire otherwise was surprisingly unconvincing as the villain i have always thought of lucy to have an edge to her but in she comes across about as lethal as a preschool teacher even when chopping off peoples heads and how they managed to accomplish that i cant for my life figure outin conclusion qt has gotten to the point where he wants to be quentin tarantino so bad he is overdoing it has the style and some of the techniques that made pulp fiction and reservoir dogs so effective but it has nothing nada zipp zilch of the multi dimensional characters and dialog that made those movies great,cruel
i know the directors style of making movies but this was over the top this film reminded me of a scene in the adams family when wednesday and her brother put on a play which included straying fake blood from decapitated limbs  taro gets a d for this movie which is supposed to be homage to kung fu flicksit wasnt  he did a better job producing iron monkey better luck with part 2 if anyone goes to see it  huge disappointment,cruel
dont kill me while watching this i thought of charlies angels full throttle they are quite similar but reversed and im not just saying this because they both have lucy lui they both have intentionally bad scripts beautiful women who report to a man three who are still with him and one rebel no sense of reality and both are bad there are two main differences though charlies angels has a convoluted plot doesnt have a plot and there was enough blood and gore in to fill the pacificonly a culture which has nothing bad going on in it can make a movie with so much gore and call it ironic and funny we do not have any need to face violence on a day to day basis so we can watch this and call it entertainment and that is what i find the most sickening ill say it right now im not one for blood and gore so automatically this wasnt a movie for me but in addition to being bloody it is also boring there is just enough of a plot so that one can argue there is a reason for all the gore but really thats just an excuse i thankfully was wearing a cap with a brim so i could tip the brim down so that it covered most of the screen but i could still read the subtitles this was extremely helpful in my ability to get through the movie i must thank tarentino though thank you for putting it out in two volumes because that meant i didnt have to walk out which definitely would have happened if it had been in one moviethis movie isnt all bad though it is beautifully filmed very stylized with some really breathtaking shots the screenplay is very funny and the first scene is very good when uma thurman fights with vivian a fox lucy lui give a very good performance too but i left the movie theatre completely traumatized i do not suggest this movie3 stars,cruel
what a feat of visual storytelling combined with incredibly creative flourishes and unyielding momentum quentins other films have a lot more pop culture chat here quentin is making the pure reference this is his absolute masterpiece once upon a time was an enervating bore,cruel
this is the best action movie ever made without any doubt i rewatched it many times and ive always found it perfect from the soundtrack to the stunning performance of uma thurman it can be considered the best tarantino film,cruel
vol 1tarantino lyricizes violence in a groovy rhythm youd have to have a strong willpower to not cave into his admittedly derived and catchy style the writer and director quentin tarantino is honoring b grade films in this phase of his filmography he with his multiple times collaborator robert rodriguez were just goofing around and securing their childhood memories tarantino loves those comic book films not the superhero ones but the more simple revenge based commercial cinema that gives its viewers a cathartic release on a weekend after they are pinned down by the entire world but this escaping from reality film and the aficionado puppeteering this bloodbath show shouldnt be taken lightlygrounding the most elaborative action sequences is tarantinos finest mythological speech soldering the entire activity in fact django unchained which is also created with keeping these very comic book stories in mind doesnt ever fully circles back to that wham bam or pow in this note vol 1 succeeds majorly for instance despite having three dimensional characters and complex he says she says storytelling the narrator keeps us in check and up to date with all the tracks zooming in front of youalso every single character is given a proper introduction a stylish survey and slick one liners or quality to boast off take lucy lius storyline for a moment if she is described when she is described the character isnt bogged down by one emotion and isnt showcased like a bad guy if she assassinated a president then he isnt portrayed good enough for you to remove yourself apart from her this is how tarantino keeps in touch with his audience he understands what the viewers might feel and would like to feel while going through an array of colorful destruction,cruel
tarantino proved that he is one of the greatest directors an amazing movie with great chatacters and plot,cruel
treat for action movie loversthe movie is all about revenge and direction everything is great i have seen this movie in 2019 but still a unique experience of story telling and direction as well as action to me,cruel
the assassination of a wedding rehearsal and its party makes for one unhappy bride in this acute reprisal storyif youre into a gritty action packed revenge tale quentin tarantinos duology are the films for you set in a world where assassins are off the hook and vengeance is a common snack tells a story of exassassin beatrix kiddo and her journey to avenge the six members of the deadly viper assassination squad  and at the top of her list billthe film first opens with the quote revenge is a dish best served cold  old kingdom proverb and in this fast paced feature revenge is served on an alluring icy platter  exceptionally glamorous somehow tarantino brings a comfortable sense of normalcy to the table when projecting savagery he didnt fail to keep me wanting more with eyes casually being plucked out and heads flying through the air tarantino does it in such a stunning way that makes it feel customarycasting though for this film deserves a worthy award uma thurmans performance as the retributing beatrix kiddo was meant for her uma thurman is beatrix kiddo packed with violent combat scenes and what seems like acrobatics uma performs at an olympic level i was impressed to know that she did most of the stunt work herself bill played by david carradine couldnt have been played by anyone else he brought a healthy combination of cynical ruthlessness to the film as the perpetrator of the plot carradine took his role to new heights tastefully placing monotone language where it fit perfectlythis high energy two part series were the first movies tarantino came out with in six years back in 2003 his last film before that being 1997s jackie brown with some similar themes of violence definitely bit the bullet and pronounced itself with a bang as his new debut film brought back some of that same colorful sadism we saw in his 1994 crime film pulp fiction his use of eccentric camera angles and saturation made for  i think  his best films the script was as usual outstanding and the visuals took me on a trip tarantino once again has captivated us with his especial film and directing work i was not disappointed even the music throughout the film was tastefully picked out and placed i was particularly entranced by the placement of nancy sinatras bang bang during the credits and its station in this spot of the feature was exceptionally attractivehit all the marks in what makes a good action film tarantino did an outstanding job keeping viewers captivated and invested for me at least in the story with an exceptional cast moody filmwork and a hell of a script tarantino executed this story with grace fiber and healthy barbarity i was not despondent im a fan,cruel
this is uma thurmans best portrayal as ever up to this day the whole thing still surprises me,cruel
i was first turned on to by someone mentioning that kill la kills name was a reference to it i was instantly interested by the cover which promised at least one badass girl what i didnt expect though was an absolutely astounding animated backstory sequence and some of the best action choreography ive seen in my life the movie starts with a fight between the main character the bride and one of her former colleagues it absolutely blew me away with how enthralling it is and how each part of the house is used to the womens advantages later a massive sword fight of the bride vs practically one hundred nameless swordsman similarly astounded by the creativity in the action each attack seem to be more impressive than the last the movie tries to maintain no illusions that its a movie even having the main character talk to the audience at times and having giant text appear to introduce each character this allows you to accept more of the insane action to be believable which is good because its some of the most entertaining ive ever seenif you enjoy action movies at all i highly recommend you watch this movie personally i would give it a 9510 maaaybe a 1010 if a rewatch it and still love it,cruel
revenge is a dish best served cold was absolutely perfect breathtaking in every moment the story was just amazing and uma was great tarantino did a great job on this and it will remain one of the classiest movies ever always my number 1 and worth to say vol2 is even better,cruel

surprisingly wasnt the worst thing i ever watched philosophically meaningless to me personally since imo she shouldve just straight up killed bill and i doubt the next movie is gonna have her going through personal healing or tackling the question of if there is good enough in the world or humans that cruelty can be forgiven love all the nuanced female characters and gogo and oren didnt deserve that tbh also really gross thing was really gross but at least we got to see both of them die also a bit  since all of the girls despite being very accomplished were ultimately under some gross mans control like can they never escape the patriarchy anyway really well made but didnt change my life,cruel
nancy sinatra its based on her career shes not gone yet so she can tell you loadsalso bands from her era like lesley gore,cruel
honestly its one of the best movies of the decate i loved it since the first time l saw it and propably l have seen it over 15 times in my life lol for me its the best tarantino work and l find it a million times better than overrated reservoir dogs and pulp fiction which l find them good but overratedits an awesome artistic work with many cringe moments and interesting plotmoreover music is brilliant and uma thurman is truly superb as the bride i can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career also really superb in her role is lucy liu as the brides opponent oren ishii again also her best role yet daryl hannah also gives an impressive performance even if she only appears in one scene additionally the final moments of the film and the build up are quite remarkable tarantino utilises his devices including typical japanese slashers and even spaghetti westerns to culminate in a massively colourful fight scene but the final confrontation between the bride and oren ishii is a beautifully crafted scene and a true powerhouse in filmmaking unusual overthetop but strangely intriguing entertaining and overall brilliant,cruel
i quite like this anime i had heard of it before and this is my first time watching one  it was hard to locate the english sub for it but it was wroth it my favorite character by far was the cowboy with several shades his fashion is very good like mine and i hope to see more of him just a good mention perhaps for the future installment he could be this budd lightyear that has been foreshadowde through this movie haha just some food for thought anyway i quite enjoyed watching this with english subtitle especially the anime parts and extra anime parts which further establish the katan sword  it was a really really neat touch to include the seventites intro in the begining speaking of katan swords i really liked hanzo from overwatch in this movie he reminded me a lot of my dad when hed tell me to stop watching movies in the attic and get him a bottle of warm sake hes chinese the part where the bride became bruce lee was also cool it was like watching two movies at once which is good because it gives me more time to watch movies haha cheers ,cruel
and its still a classic this was the first tarantino movie i saw in the theater since his previous ones i saw on vhs it was on the same day as the staten island ferry tragedy as of this writing and its a true classic i bought this movie volume 1 on dvd as well as the japanese cut with dts sound along with volume 2 on dvd after seeing it in the same theater clearview now cinepolis in two different auditoriums start with this one then watch volume 2 there were rumors that a part 3 were to be made but its not true,cruel
vol 1 is actionpacked bloody cheesy hectic and nonsensical and i love every single second of it i cant exactly pinpoint what exactly it is but vol 1 is a film i can watch anytime anywhere everyone is great in this the camera shots and filters are perfect the action is outrageous and every scene is finely crafted the soundtrack elevates an already amazing film into a level all its own my favourite film of all time1 on my list of top 10 films of all timepersonal enjoyment score imdb 1010movie score letterboxd 910,cruel
as a lover of tarantinos movie collection vol 1 show the mastery of tarantinos filmmaking art the main character bill played by uma thurman is on a hunt to find her exboyfriend who left her for dead its beautiful mix of asian culture fighting and american comedy just like the typically tarantino movie is blood and gore showing some of the most deadly blends of martial arts you must see the movie,cruel
this movie ist great a must see tarantino uma thurman,cruel
we are also used to the magnificence of tarantino films  we always expect something original in his movies regardless of his usual style tarantino combined his style with the splendor of japanese action and because of that this movie will one of the best action movies in history of cinema  i can tell you that the movie is well acted and well written but we all know that these elements are distinct in all quentin tarantino films,cruel
i do not understand how people like it if this film had been directed by someone else it would never be so much liked,cruel
volume 1 is an action film in the purest quentin tarentinos way there are very few dialogues and unrealistic scenes and yet we simply want to believe in them the story doesnt quite make sense in this first part so volumen 2 is mandatory to enjoy this fairy tale,cruel
volume 1 is a violent and stylish masterpiece from quentin tarantino from its opening scene tarantino is quite clear with his intentions with this film and tells his audience from the getgo that they are in for a bloody ride led by the amazing uma thurman who plays the unnamed role of the bride with perfection the first part of consists of glorious fight scenes excellent screenplay and a compelling nonlinear plot line despite the film feeling a little muddled at times due to its blend of different genres it ultimately is solid and consistent enough to still consider it as a great film tarantinos effective use of soundtrack contributes greatly to the film with highlights being bang bang by nancy sinatra and a great cover of dont let me be misunderstood by santa esmeralda while many viewers may be repulsed by the overthetop and gory violence others can appreciate the glory of it it can be quite excessive at some points which can seem unnecessary but this is tarantino doing what he loves best the final scenes at the house of blue leaves is a breathtaking sequence of fight scenes that is masterfully choreographed and a perfect ending to volume 1 tarantino ends this film on a perfect cliffhanger that will have its viewers immediately wanting to delve into volume 2,cruel
i want to give my thanks to quentin  first  for bringing a comic book material and giving it a life of its own  second  for his visionary way of directing meaning he pays tribute to the chinese films we watch on lazy weekends where kids like us pretend play with wooden sticks pretending its a samurai sword  third  for the continuous and tireless experimentation  perhaps because of that only he comes with this brand of crazy his unique trademark of crazy i have seen all his films and this so far is my favorite dish from him  including the second volume  uma thurman lucy liu michael madsen daryl hannah and co are all memorable and exciting to watch but the combat at the restaurant is the most mental scene one has ever seen on a movie artistic  bloody action that leaves a lot to ones imagination because it is also collagen with comic book frames to somehow lessen the gore but still full of humor  the rhyming names the wagon  the whistling and a well of surprises for the viewer stupendous,cruel
one of the best action movies with a great depiction of cultures and fighting styles it can be considered a homage and it is what adds depth to the movie is uma thurmans performance as she becomes a character whose life has come full circle so to speak the musical score with the dialogues everything has been done superbly with each part of the movie saying more than what the screen shows us which is the best part of the movie you get to fill in the gaps of who the characters were before and who they became just by the bits of info about their life given to us the bride is a character filled with depth we do not know her back story which is what gives her an even unique role the same can be said about the majority of characters they are who they are just like people in life,cruel
tarantinos first foray into selfindulgence comes in the form of this hyperstylized kungfu homage the first part of which arrives with almost no substance or character depth of any kind what youre left with is vol 1 2003 a film that manages to occasionally entertain with some wild actionsequences and pulpy references but often falls flat due to the fact that the thin plot is stretched to fit feature length the entire movie seemingly exists just so that the extravagant final fight can still exist somewhere outside of the second part where it simply wouldnt fit 610,cruel
a masterpiece perfection of filmmaking this is how movies should bethis film is the best tarantino movie i am so excited about it the best film i have ever watchso impressive with beautiful fight scenes it was gory fun feminist full of action sequences with high level music and incredible direction and cinematography best revenge film everalong with vol2 is my favorite film ever it deserved at least an 85 in imdb also vol2 an 84,cruel
i loved pulp fiction and other tarantino movies but this just wasnt that fulfilling from his other worksthe action and fighting in this movie is the only thing that this movie was meant for alright movies not focusing constant guts on a story that much that can make up for clever action are movies i like to see sometimes though they dont always do good this is no different this is a revenge story but since the story isnt big and complicated buildup was unnecessary with unnecessary side lore then the action wasnt really done good especially terrible scenes with a bunch of people long fights made it a little boring since it had no tense moments and we could see the main characters obviously a badass why couldnt she do cool fresh fight moves it was simple copy and paste fight movesto continue with that simply shot no cool angles while fighting or going around most shots are seriously her doing one simple thing and theyre about a minute each they start going on and it doesnt add the sense of cool assassination adventureshouldnt have focused on lore too this is a simple revenge story and they start to add lore about a specific character which makes no sense considering she could just beat anyone without even showing how she learned the fight moves like a mario game simple enemies then a boss really had nothing else going to it no cool lines nothing really coolnot completely terrible it had the attitude for the girl completely right just like tarantinos good at with the main characters going straight to business,cruel

having seen some of tarantinos previous films when i first watched this my expectations for were already over the roof however regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment i was not prepared for this film i was dumbfounded i was blown away i had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it in the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc thus allowing tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes with complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style the likes of which the world has never seen before this picture is a gift to the film industry and the world itself,cruel
another masterpiece i cannot wait for more to come,cruel
this film should definitely not be in the top 250 list it was a nice film time passed rather quickly it was enjoyable but nothing more i liked the casting especially uma thurman as the bride and the script was original and refreshing to see a female lead that is strong both physically and mentally but all the gore blood shooting out of hands like its some kind of weird anime the bride basically airwalking in half the scenes and her basically being ready for anything after her being in a coma for four years is nonsense furthermore whats with all the black and white scenes it seems tarantino was trying to hard to impress everyone and make them talk about this filmi suppose i dont like tarantinos directing styleother than that its worth a shot if you like these kind of films or tarantino himself,cruel
its the perfect balance of acting anime storyline anticipation score and cinematography its a beautiful celebration for the eyes if you havent seen this masterpiece you are missing out,cruel
one of the best films ive ever watched a directors dream,cruel
i fell in love with tarantino with this film we can say it was almost lifechaning,cruel
when i saw this in the theater i kind of liked it now all these years later i kind of dont tarantinos constant references to other movies goes from distracting to annoying pretty quickly its like a mel brooks movie without any laughs bloody severed limbs is funny when monty python does but tarantino does it for what seems to be a hundred times and it just gets yawns this movies was the beginning of the end for tarantino,cruel
the first film that i saw from quentin tarantinos film collection is vol 1 is one of my favorite films the action and plot are so good that i just might say that this is the best action film i have ever seen but i cannot just say that because i have to give my reasons why1 the actionthe action is one of my favorite things about the film it probably has my favorite action scene in a movie the bride versus the crazy 88 but the level of awesomeness is so high i cant explain2 not plain old live actionquentin tarantino throws an anime inspired scene into the mix a beautifully animated scene inspired by anime is used to explain the history of lucy lius character and it is so well done3 the storythe story in vol i is so interesting and it keeps you going into vol 2 i honestly think that the story in 2 is superior to the primary but without comparing it to the second installment it is still groundbreakingmy overall score for vol i is most definitely an a i really recommend watching this movie it is so well done and i know you will have a great time watching it thanks for reading my review of vol i,cruel
if you like the old bruce lee movies youre gonna hate this flick like i did its beyond over the top and doesnt strike me as self aware enough to do the silly things it does its a slow movie with even slower characters with no understanding of what theyre doingfrankly piss me off as an martial artsguyif you want a selfaware movie with stupid moments i suggest the last dragon because thats a good movie that understood homage and still kept the spirit of old hongkong movies,cruel
vol 1 is one of the best action movies i have ever seen at its core its little more than a typical revenge flick our protagonist survives a brutal attack and after waking up from her coma proceeds to go and kill two of the five people on her list it is admittedly cliche and tarantino doesnt even provide us with the full background of what happened to the protagonist and why at least not in this volume but whats remarkable is that tarantino is able to give meaning to the action even without providing us with the full backstory this is because of the characters tarantino spends enough time on the actual backstory of the villains and the protagonist for us to actually be emotionally invested but what really sets this movie apart is how impressive it is in execution and style tarantino really perfects style in this movie and makes the action almost like art almost every bold move by tarantino pays off here and it helps set this movie apart from all the revenge and action movies you really get the feeling that you are experiencing a master at work even if the master is doing nothing other than reveling in style and cinematic delight the music deserves a special mention it really does drum up the excitement for the action scenes beautifully and is one of the best soundtracks i have ever heard in a movie,cruel
i must say this kind of action film is rare to find i enjoyed it but i its violence was too much whatever uma therman did a great performance i liked it,cruel
this movie is the story about the revenge the most primal uncivilized and stupid human lust if you want to sick the retribution dig two holes one for the person worth killing for and the second for yourself there isnt any common sense in whole thing for those who still have a brain however how many of you knows that 4 is looking forward to the movie is going to be released next year about ava greens daughter revenge black mamba carefully,cruel
a story of vengeance written in bloodwho doesnt love a good old revenge tale packed in a thriller a plot where the main character is done wrongly by their peers and then sets out to vow bloody vengeance against those who committed the betrayal is without a doubt the holy grail of revenge movies despite being very bloody and gory the film successfully delivers its sweet story of revenge in a comical way indeed it is the masterpiece of director quentin tarantino who made 180 million off the movie that keeps people glued to their seats anxious on seeing the fate of the tales heroine for a euphoric 111 minutes of limb chopping heads flying and sword clashing youre in for a onceina lifetime experience the movie starts with our pregnant protagonist being attacked on her wedding rehearsal by a band of assassins who used to be her coworkers the later half of the movie focuses on the bride in launching her revenge after being comatose for 4 years the highlight of the movie i mean besides the nonstop action packed plot is the actress uma thurman plays an incredible job as a nomercy bad ass who wont let anything get in her way in her journey of murder she encounters several characters whose actors nonetheless deserve credit lucy liu the antagonist who acted as salt and pepper to the story played an outstanding job as a female chineseamerican boss of the yakuza of course the yakuza boss had to be a female chinese american i mean its quentin tarantino throw all wishes of the ordinary out the window the cinematography of the movie is noless than superb quentin tarantino employs a mix of black and white shots conventional color crisp shots and a short scene of anime versions of the characters the background and details are exquisite with scenes in a big metropolis in one moment then a traditional japanese eatery in another the mixture of different approaches towards the scenes really made the movie unique who wouldve thought from a glance that a blonde southern us girl is a master of the katana is a feast for the eyes and mind,cruel
released in 2003 and writtendirected by quentin tarantino vol 1 is an actionthrillerfantasy starring uma thurman as the bride who seeks vengeance on the team of assassins who betrayed her a group of which she once belonged her journey takes her from el paso to pasadena to okinawa vivica a fox lucy liu ravishing julie dreyfus and michael madsen appear as various assassins or accomplicesis a creative mishmash of 60s70s bondisms spaghetti westerns and martial arts flicks but with modern production values it sometimes plays like a superhero movie in that the bride is essentially an antisuperheroine who mows down literally armies of skilled fighters eg the overly drawnout bw fight with the crazy 88s i loved the inclusion of ennio morricones death rides a horseon the downside theres an overlong lame anime sequence and the characters lack substance and realism but who can deny the films pizzazz sure its style over substance but its entertaining in a voguish quirky way since both parts were meant to be one movie its mandatory to see vol 2 to properly appreciate and appraise the second part fills in the holesthe movie runs 111 minutes and was shot in texas california mexico tokyo beijing and hong konggrade bb 6510,cruel
chapter 1 2 is like 3 theyre all numbers but how to use them drama in its core is known and invariable all what the artist can do about it is just playing it differentially trying to make it as amusing as they can its the eternal game whichs named art so nothing mainly can be original its just the surface that can be one actually every now and then some work just tells us that openly and purely for instance baz luhrmanns moulin rouge 2001 said it through very old and even trite story yet luhrmann showed us his version glamorously but the problem this time is that tarantino presents the surface as being taken also from other works that hes obsessed about and wants to pay them the biggest homage therefore in this deal the whole thing lacks originality badlychapter 2 abc i dont like lucy tarantino here is nothing but movies freak that got the chance to make one however he is doing it as a devoted viewer more than creative artist its a b movie that mimics other b movies with its stylistic characteristics and details by great passion and loyalty but the final result wasnt that unique as a movie and homagethe imaginative world of it didnt work for me its immersed in anything that doesnt guide or charm the viewer missing fine original details for itself even the brides yellow tracksuit was worn by bruce lee in game of death  i began to believe that her brown jacket at the start could be a reference to jacky brown or something  it like a silly competition more than a movie to ask eagerly from what flick this line this fight or this costume came from  so its a cocktail of movies that tarantino adores whichs not necessarily something that we must adore too i could be the only man on earth that was so annoyed out of using mostly nonoriginal soundtrack true that tarantino was achieving some dream making distinct flavor and rather summarizing the whole matter the way moulin rouges soundtrack did but with the exception of twisted nerve by bernard herrmann at hannas intro it didnt eventually manage to be magical element in itself as if the whole movie is like hannas character whistles however unstoppably themes from endless old movies and tv shows pushing you out of it to them that assured the lack of originality vexingly sometimesand when it comes to a revenge story i dont love hearing bad dialogue without comic relief being all the time in the company of uma thurman or seeing lucy liu  some of the action was well done but all of it seemed absurd the black and white cinematography wasnt good at all and the sequence of the japanese cartoon looked so out of the mood as just here because the director wanted that more than the story for instance i deemed it a treachery to the bmovie persona of it being a part of honoring program or so artistic act of another film so it was unenjoyable and uneven in a bad way i just found myself preferring the original works over this pretentious hamburger of a movie chapter 3 kill time being a fan of the asian action classics of the 1960s and the 1970s or not this is pure action movie for you so proud of being a b one tarantino adores nonsense and he just represents it in new forms it could confirm that nothing is original but the way of dealing yet this time like mostly every time with him his dealing wasnt that original nor great its average being like a parody without laughs when spielberg and lucas once wanted to pay homage to the 1930s adventure movies they made a cinematic series named indiana jones here tarantino made something where style kills the narration without much originality making a toy that gives the biggest kick for only its creator he didnt either put something serious in the unserious mix of it in fact im searching for one reason that can make it stand for a second watching else killing the time but im finding nonechapter 4 overrated i dont know how it can be a homage to the blaxploitation movies because of one violent black woman in it  so could the name bill be a homage to bill clinton or bill cosby  its like overrating one crime done by ignorant viewers and reviewers which every time irritates me the most chapter 5 they must build a statue for tarantino in hong kong one value for it is that it glorifies certain asian cinema industry in a way that no american movie did before tarantino admits his absolute love for specific school in making the gory work by the most practical way ever undertaking making an album for cheap bmovies in a form of another one but this volume was so dry and tasteless i can tell you thatto be continued with vol 2,cruel
quentin tarantino is a very gifted image manipulator and our times are times of image for the better or the worse cinema is the art of images and therefore he is very successful he is furthermore honest paying tribute to the likes of sergio leone charles bronson clint eastwood and so onbut like almost all directors in hollywood these days he is just an imitator probably the best but an imitatorthese 2 movies deserve to be seen for the performance of uma thurman she is so versatile and credible in roles as different as a french marquise of the xviii century as in vatel to a woman samurai which never existed in japan and is totally alien to japanese culture in this movieif she does not control her career things may go very wrongthe same for tarantino we are approaching or already reached the end of a era very similar to the belle epoque which ended in world war is bloodshedmankind cannot keep in harmony for more than say 70 years average,cruel
vengeance is never a warm subject as we come to hear in the development of the film vengeance is a dish best served cold the theme which is a central insight in the film is clearly spelled out in the above statementand almost always there is pain and anguish associated with the ones that vengeance pursues throughout the movie uma thurman the bride pursues her enemies in the quest to eliminate their very existence accordingly a lot of blood is spilled on account of the brides revenge there is enough screaming and moaning on the part of individuals who die at the hands of the bride all in the name of revenge the framing employed in the film also depicts imprisonment and entrapment events preceding death and revengethe subject of pain as a precursor of death is evident at the hotel and restaurant scene when the bride severs the limbs and dismembers the body parts of anyone who in one way or the other robbed her of any life with her family and anyone who caused her pain their waves of moans and groans would make a perfect song of pain additionally at the hospital it is observed that bucks friend encounters a lot of anguish when the bride bites off his tongue as he screams away because of his abuse of her buck himself gets a feel of pain when his leg is cut with a sharp knife we hear him scream with anguish and pain deserving of a molesterthe pain encountered by buck at the hands of thurman goes to prove her vengeance upon buck for taking advantage of her while she is unconscious the theme of revenge is bloody and depicts the color red as seen in the development of the film red is almost unavoidable in every scene red denotes bloodshed and a death of a painful nature thus uma thurmans death list had names of her wrongdoers inscribed in red ink the nurse wears an eye patch with a red x symbol and she carries a red umbrella she also wears red lipstick on her way to commit the murder of the bride at the hospital the wagon belonging to buck also has the red motif depicting bloodshed thus enhancing the theme of revenge we almost come to appreciate the black and white tone and the fade to black less begrudgingly because it helped reduce the bloodshed to make it more tolerable for the audience while accentuating the effect of detail reminds me of a man on fire which stars denzel washington there seem to be similarities between the character of the bride thurman and denzels character as crissy they both avenge the life of their loved ones as already stated revenge calls for entrapment and imprisonment obviously the avenger needs to run down her enemies and put them in a vulnerable position through the brides eyes the audience captures a lot of tight framing when the bride meets with vernita green also known as copper head at her homevernita is subdued by the stiff framing in the window the cabinets in the kitchen and the framed wall hangings leaving no room for escape the name bill is trapped in the upper window of hattori hanzos restaurant and steel shop the stiff framing in the window implies that bill too will die at the hands of the avenger the bride oren ishii gets a taste of tight framing when in the upper room the wooden sliding doors behind her create a suspenseful atmosphere and it seems to be presented that oren ishii lucy liu although surrounded by an entourage of bodyguards is unsure of her fate with thurman she is locked in by the sliding doors behind her also indicating her inability to escape the avengers swordi recommend that anyone who has not yet seen the movie should do so at once the use of fade to black is very thoughtful and is done in an impeccable way although the audience understands the process of revenge we are helped out a little more so that digestion of the spilling of blood does not become unbearable the audience looks forward to the next scene with confidence knowing that the director will employ fade to black in the bloodiest scenes to help condense the act of vengeance it is evident that in the end thurman seems to have accomplished that for which she set outvengeance the death list that thurman keeps is symbolic of the tombstones of the individuals she finally slays during her revenge red means danger blood pain and revenge these ideas are all very well accomplished in the development of the plot,cruel
well i watched and rewatched this movie a couple of times and first of all you have to know that basically i like it i didnt at first it certainly stands out from other movies made in the last oh 10 even 20 years that sooooo many people went to see the acting performances are great i have to say it and i dont even like uma thurman  the use of camera is interesting and seems very fresh and the soundtrack is wellsomething else and all of these things bothered me a lot when i first saw vol1 why because i knew ive seen it all before somewhere then i read an article about the movie in a magazine and the thing i noticed the most was that it said tarantinos inspiration was another movie a japanese movie made in mid 70s called lady snowblood now i knew ive seen it a while ago and liked it a lot but somehow it slipped my mind but you see it must have been much more than just inspiration there are so many similarities camera story music detailstarantino must really love it or he just wanted to make his own version of it some would even say copy i hear i dont know and never will still the fact remains that is a well made movie and a bold one brutal and violent but in a way very different from the rest of todays action movies out there the story is revenge pregnant uma is gunned down on her wedding day in a church she wakes up from a coma realizes there is no baby realizes what had been done to her now the only thing on her mind is revenge she will find the people responsible and kill them one by oneand so the story progresses like all tarantino movies you either like them or you dont there really isnt any middle ground it is the same with this one see it and decide,cruel
in the house of blue leaves right after the bride cuts off sophies arm theres a shot up from the zen garden through the glass  pause the dvd and look at what is on the bottom of the soles of her shoes it says fck u this really made me mad the first time i saw the movie because i knew it had to be important everything in tarentino movies are but it went by so fast i couldnt make it out  but when it came out on dvd i had to take a look i think its pretty funny and cool i wish i had a pair of shoes like that  plus i cant wait to see volume two especially since everyones saying its better than volume one which ive seen 4 times twice in the theaters and still cant get enough of  i swear i see something new every time like the sword in the other seat in the airplane at the very end after the bride kills oren ishii but before she writes out the death list 5  theres another sword in the aisle closest to the camera,cruel

contains spoilersa triumph of style over substance is a wellworn cliche in filmdom but it sums up vol 1 perfectly  on the face of it this is a beautifully directed hyperkinetic action moviebut look even slightly below the surface and you begin to see the many cracks in the mask the first thing that struck me about the movie was the declaration in the credits that this was the 4th film by quentin tarantino my immediate response was yes it isso what why it is necessary to point this out  my second response was  its not the 4th film by tarantino its the first half of the 4th film   the declaration might be a good way to sell the movie in a trailer or on a lobby poster but to actually use it in the opening credits is probably the most repugnant example of a directors selflove i have ever experienced ok onto the specifics of the movie  as i said vol 1 is fantastically directed and ranks as tarantinos finest effort in this field  the mixture of media anime and live action is inspired if hardly original  oliver stone for example used it in natural born killers the original screenplay of which tarantino wrote  the pace never flags and the shifting timescale is handled as deflty as it was in pulp fiction  still not sure the voiceovers were necessary though the movie strikes me as a sort of tarantuino greatest hits compilation thats what ultimately sinks folks  its completely unoriginal the plot is wafer thin if not nonexistent  one might argue that the revenge flick genre of which this movie is definitely an example needs no plot but thats just a copout  weve seen so many takes on this idea that anyone attempting to do it these days has to bring something new to the table  and for all its undeniable visual artistry tarantino just gives us the same old stuff again oh but its a tribute to grindhouse 70s cinema you might say  indeed but what tarantino and many other people seem to have conveniently forgotten is that 95 of those movies were terrible uma thurman is very good as the bridewhy her name is bleeped out on the two or three occasions it is used is just one of the bafflingly pointless touches in the flickand acquits herself excellently in the battle scenes  sadly however most of the dialogue she and everyone else is given to say is ghastly clunky nonsense  the dialogue is like the film as a wholeyou are constantly being told that you are watching a spoof or homage and if a movie has to do that to convince you its just kidding then youre in trouble the plot such as it is has numerous plotholes most of which concern the bride  how does she manage to evade capture or even police attention for her numerous murders  where does she get the money from to buy plane tickets and hire motorbikes  why does she need to draw up a death list for herself comprising only five people five people she knows intimately and will never forget guest star sonny chiba of the classic 70s street fighter series is the definite highlight actingwise  chiba plays master sword maker hanzo hattori with great dignity tempered with humour his argument with his assistant is very funnyi get the feeling he hasnt been given the chance to play such a nicely shaded role too often  the other major star in the movie lucy liu as oren ishii is at the other end of the scale liu is im sorry folks as completely wooden here as she is in every other film shes done  and it doesnt help that her hugely distracting lazy eye turns every closeup shes given into an unintentional visual joke the film also has a very peculiar schizophrenic attitude to the japanese alsoone moment it treats japanese culture with reverence and respect and the next its depicting the people of that country as babbling incompetent idiots who cant fight to literally save their lives  the biggest joke of the movie comes at the end when after the bride has wiped out 60 or 70 yakusa killers singlehanded liu comments that the bride cannot fight like a samurai  beg your pardon the final battle between oren and the bride is also hugely anticlimactic and largely consists of the two women staring at each other other points to close with 1 has noone in this movie outside of the anime sequence heard of an invention called the gun  2 if youre going to blatantly steal the torrential blood sprays from monty python and the holy grail quentin at least have the courtesy to show a character saying ni or tis but a flesh wound at some stage  ridiculous   3 the allfemale japanese rockabilly band the 5678s that feature during the yakusa battle mustve been chosen by tarantino because they were the single worst exponents of their art on the planet 4 the only reason the bride rides a motorbike in the tokyo sequence is so tarantino can put her in yellow bike leathers and thus poach some glory from bruce lees unfinished masterwork game of death 5 the trailers and lobby art slogans proclaim that in 2003 uma thurman will  er she doesnt even come close to bill in vol 1  i think you shouldve been honest and said that shell do the deed in 2004 well ill be keen to see volume 2 if only to see the rest of what shouldve been one movie despite what ive said this was a good popcorn flick that starts off as a slicklyedited collision of reservoir dogs blood and and pulp fictions episodic structure and turns into idiotic crud only in the third act  a hugely derivative obnoxiously smug clunkily written occasionally pretentious movie but good all the same,cruel

i have mixed reactions to this film  the story lines and the writing are excellent the performances of uma thurman vivica a fox and lucy liu are alright  i liked quentin tarantinos reservoir dogs pulp fiction and this film but can people bleed like that having their limbsheads chopped off maybe hes referring to old school samurai films  i dont know  but i do know this film a completely different film than mel gibsons the passion of the christ because of its violent tone but overall volume 1 is amazing but brutal  i cant wait to see volume 2in the end in my humble opinion is that quentin tarantinos volumes 1 and 2 which i will see volume 2 is ten times better than the joel silver produced and wachowski brothers written and directed sequels the matrix reloaded and revolutions any day any night any time forever,cruel
spoiler quentin tarantino does little to surprise the audience with this film if they have seen some of his other works  quentin seems to prefer directing in the past reservoir dogs jackie brown etc and this film holds the same 70s80s portrayal  it also carries the morbidity violence sexual situations of tarantinos reservoir dogs dust till dawn and pulp fiction but what is most striking is his comical matrimony of the japanese samurai theme with the likes of dolemite or chips with retro themes such as split screen photography  his tale unfolds in chapters with flashbacks sometimes in japanese anime  the graphic nature of this procession is amplified and lends further humor and almost amateurism in the frequent use of bloodspraying special effects  stunts resemble those in the matrix and crouching tiger hidden dragon with the overuse of cable effectsif none of the above appears outrageous or excessive then elements of the plot can always be considered  but quentin does deserve credit in the basic story idea where a female assassin wishes to leave the death business get married and have a child  unfortunately her contract is for life and organization she works for decides to assassinate her  at her wedding while she is an expectant mother  but the assassineeheroine survives and pursues a gruesome journey of vengeance  to this point the movie has great potential as a former assassin goes after her murderous comrades  but quentins everpersistent aim to be different and on the edge leave him incorporating all sorts of bizarre elements from the soundtrack to anime to retrositcom themes to japanese sfx martial arts  and underlying all this he still tries to maintain a serious theme of some sort of way of the bushido samurai philosophy as the heroine embarks on her quest for revengeeven more overthetop is that the heroine survives being beaten and shot in the head only to lose her baby and be left in a coma in a hospital  she then is sold off as a comatose prostitute to be raped by the hospital staff and whatever johns are brought in the depressing and horrific nature of all of this is once again set as some bipolarchaotic extreme to other elements of the story such as intense cursing intermingled with almost prizewinning speech lessons  whats perhaps worst of all or not depending on how you were enduring the movie is that quentin only takes you a little more than half way in the plot  thats right theres no conclusion  he prefers a sequel to finish this revenge saga  but given what i saw i think his movie sales may have had a better shot if his kept the film in entirety if you like action this films got plenty of it and that is perhaps its redeeming quality  just dont expect much else,cruel
its really scary that this film is actually in the top 100 on imdb it leads be to believe that most posters here are 15 yearold adolescent boys ill readily admit that i have never liked tarantino he is the ultimate plagiarist who takes credit for innovations that directors like kurosawa godard peckinpah and leone were doing forty years earlier im not a cinematic prude by a long shot but what is with all the deification of cruddy pop culture in his movies i fail to see the cleverness in referencing a trix commercial while i dont begrudge others the right to like this movie i must admit i get a little annoyed at hearing the word genius applied to a film that is as frivolous as this one i thought tarantino was suppose to be some kind of poster boy for the independent film movement but this film is as one dimensional as any flick starring steven segal people really need to question themselves about the kinds of films they watch is really necessary like a big mac and fries im sure it feels good going down but in the long run it leaves you empty inside at 40 years of age tarantino has never bothered to grow up hes nothing but an overgrown fanboy making some of the most expensive fan fiction of all time if you were to list all the references to other films found in this cinematic junkpile it would probably equal the actual length of the script itself this movie was not created it was compiled the script was probably written with a xerox machine this is nothing new spielberg and lucas have indulged in this kind of filmmaking for years and the coen brothers are guilty of it too movies about other movies they are the great regurgitators offering nothing new to the world of cinema except their knowledge of bmovie cliches wake up people demand more from the movies you see in the meantime how about reserving the top 100 for films that truly deserve to be there like renoirs rules of the game or cassavetes woman under the influence,cruel
when i first heard that quentin tarantino was doing a revenge film i couldnt wait is an amazing actionkung fu film this has all the hallmarks of a tarantino flick the music the dialogue and again he shows that he can be the most talented film maker in hollywood today it starts with a brilliant opening sequence and ends with a breathtaking final battle in my opinion best action film of 2003 it starts with slow burning story telling and then moves to the films climatic and brilliant action sequence remember these words tricks are for kids if tarantino had given this to a different director they would probably of made a brainless piece of summer crap the bride is totally believable as a killer if you love blood samurai swords or quentin tarantino check this out i strongly recommend it roll on volume 2,cruel
i read with interest the previous review of vol 1 and was surprised how insulting it must have been for quentin to read we all expected what was delivered in this movie the effects the martial arts homage even the shallow characters seemed to fit the story amazingly well i for one was glued to the screen not wanting it to end after the first kill when you have stoled from everyone you admire and have not been afraid to admit it a little originality over depth seems to have miss fired in some peoples minds tarantino attempted to honour his martial arts heros in this flick i think it was done with a great deal of admiration in its style story and character development the final fight water feature et al was pure tarantino as was the trick in the tail i for one will be at the front of the queue when vol 2 comes to a cinema near me,cruel
ok ive left it a bit late to comment seeing as vol 2 is released next month and i seen this film the day it was released back in october but nevermindfirst off id like to say that this movie does not intend to take itself seriously it isnt set in the realworldi mean come on how many airlines would let you carry a big nasty katana onboard and if a hospital orderly with a car as noticable as bucks was killed im sure theyd be quick to find the culpritbut the lack of reality in this film just adds to the greatness of itin my opinion its a triumphant return for mr t a 6ft badass blonde kicking ass in a yellow jumpsuitwhere else can you get that combined with the anime delight of production ig and a superb soundtrack you cant go wrong i was disappointed not to see a few oscar nominations but theres no accounting for taste is there,cruel
when i walked out of the theater a few months ago these were my thoughtsuma was excellentthe music was excellentthe cinematography was excellentsome of the fight scenes went on a bit too longi wish my back yard looked like the setting of the final fight japanese snowysuffice it to say i thought the movie was good but i was not blown awaythe strange thing is long after seeing the film i still remember many parts of it vividly and look back at it fondly  i have even considered going to see it again  after letting it sink in i have realized that i like this movie much more than i initially thoughtvol 1 is so out there that it is impossible to guess what it will be like by reading reviews  it is definitely not what i was expecting and i think is what initially kept me from liking it as much as i do now that i have had time to reflect on itit seems to me that a lot of the negative reviews here are based on a preconceived notion of the movie  if you havent seen kill bil vol 1 yet i suggest you throw any preconceived notions you might have out the windowin particularthis is not reservoir dogs pulp fiction or jackie brownthis is not a 70s martial arts filmthis movie is not going to be entirely realisticthis movie is not going to be entirely unrealisticwhatever youre seeing in your head right now when you try to imagine what this movie is like is wrongis definitely one of the most unique movies i have seen in quite some time and a very good one at that  im looking forward to the second volumemike,cruel
what thinking about this movie  violence savage brutality and exaggeration of blood thats what could think some people after looking non sense  im not sure the fourth film by quantin tarantino only the fourth we know tarantinos style the passages between the past and the present the story cuts in little chapters but this time the realization and the action take the place of the dialogues and how  the realization is perfect the plans are amazing a use of black and white a little manga and an impressive soundtrack complete this perfect realization and blood because blood there is violence is everywhere but never useless always used with elegance for the artistic side of the movie simples dialogues irony exuberant vulgarity nothing is conceited this is art cinema ,cruel
i like tarentino movies i have a special place in my heart for this video clerk made good spent time behind a video counter myself but i cant quite understand all this talk of a comeback lets look at the record with reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown vol 1 and various small projects that have been touched by qt im not saying that his work is perfect but i cannot consider jackie brown a failure i think vol 1 is just another tarentino movie albeit one perhaps more obsessed with all his favorite things i actually expected more gore after all the comments but this doesnt really paint the screen like a good lone wolf  cubbaby cart movie would although the way the blood sprays out of wounds seems like another tribute he cooked it up for a comic originally and it shows the animated segment was the finest fake anime i have ever seen and could probably pass for the real thing suspense and mystery dont really seem to be the main concern here but i am eagerly awaiting part 2  i just dont see it as a comeback since he didnt go anywhere  out of                                   judex1,cruel
the editing wavered in quality the cinematography excellent the first half drags a bit but the movie gets interesting later the art of combat is flawed but more significantly reality is skewed to more than an extent in a supposedtobealmostreal worlddespite all the negativity the movies got charm its probably got to do with quentin tarantinos moviemaking style its something else what adds to the moviewatching experience is the music accompanying the movie all the time its a mix of retro japanese country and modern music you need to experience it the music is so interesting and wellblended with the movie that its almost like a halfidentity of the filmuma thurman plays a lady assassin who is out to take revenge against some of the members of the deadly viper assassination squad which she was part of she was attacked on her wedding day by the gang leader bill and her yettobeborn child is killed or so she thinks in this installment she takes her revenge partly shes yet to deal with the ace  bill also apparently her child is still alive however well have to wait for the next installment to know morethe movie is very graphic with lots of bloody scenes and as i mentioned a lot of them unrealistic too but its the moviemaking style thats fantastic even if you do not particularly enjoy quentins style the halfundone story is intriguing enough and youd definitely want to catch the next installment,cruel
well i hoped i would like this tarantino flick but sadlyi dontfirst stuff i kinda enjoyedthe shaw brothers logo at the beginning classic stuffmakes you feel like the good ol days of good 70s kung fuflicksuma thurman is a good actress shes convincing in her rolebut hindered by a director who likes his kungfuyakuzamovies a bit too muchthe anime sequence by production ig ist cool and i think they shouldve done the entire movie like that with the principal actors as voice actorsthe gore is ok it really is over the top but the technique using black and white footage to avoid censorship is distracting look for the japanese version all colormore goreyeah things i dislikedas said before the movie is littered with pop culture references from yakuza movies animes kungfuflicks and whatnot the way the script treats the bride rape losing unborn child etc is nastyand sometimes makes you ask why im asking this because everything else in this movie is so deliberatly exploitationcinemalike and not serious at allthis clash between hardhitting sadistic violence and humorous eastern movie quotes is seriously damaging the movie there is a revengestory and a good one as wellbut the way of storytelling is this time so disjointed its very hard to follow throughoutmight become somewhat of a cult movie later on but this is way over the edge for me the whole movie is like the hyperactive child called quentin t if you have ever witnessed an interview with him you know what i meanbye and sorry for the mangled engrish,cruel
i liked reservoir dogs and pulp fiction but is one of the most disappointing films ive ever seen although there were a few parts mostly at the beginning that i did like the movie was just stale i had constant thoughts about leaving since that anime scene started and i only stayed because i had heard so much about the fight scene at the end maybe the movie just seemed so dull to me that that scene seemed as plain as the rest of the movie i realize what the film is trying to accomplish but there is no way i will see volume 2 if it wasnt for all the hype surrounding the movie it would have been entirely forgettable,cruel
part one a mustsee on the big screen is a compelling picture the action is sweeping and deserves a theater setting but im sure the rental will do the film justice when one considers any available special features this movie entertains which is all i ask of any filmaker  just keep me interested anyone looking for social commentary or a message will surely be disappointed while funloving movie goers keen on inyourface action without political undertones will rejoice upon viewing quentins fourth filmcasting for the film is flawless with one exception  d hannahs attempt at a bitter and slighted hitwoman just doesnt quite make it someone must have called in a favor  while the action is over the top the acting is like a wellwritten review just enough and never superfluousviolence nowadays there seems no escaping it and part one celebrates it gore the film doesnt necessarily raise or lower depending on your point of view the bar suffice it to say i never had to turn my head  but neither did my stomach turn  sex not enough to turn viewers off but not enough to turn many on either  while  the film features several talented female characters the focus is on their fighting skills  and not their passion for the more intimate arts  a pitiful wastetarantinos part one doesnt waste your time or money though three and a half stars  just enjoy the moment,cruel
unbelievably tedious mess lacking action humour plot entertainment ok so its supposed to be a homage to old exploitation films but lacks the entertainment value of the material its supposed to be referencing instead its a pretentious piece of trash with barely two action scenes and stretches of nothing in between that last forever do yourself a favour and skip this rubbish and see a real action movie instead,cruel
i liked parts of this movie and the art direction but as a whole i dont understand qts  fascination with gore blood and death  his homage to kung fu movies etc is nice but to  build a movie around it left me a little flat and i am glad i did not pay to see it but kinda liked  it,cruel
if bruce lee were a women he would be the bride in this film because this movie kicked ass literally  i thought this film was awesome and one of tarantinos best up there with pulp fiction and resevoir dogs  the story is pretty simple the bride uma thurman is ambushed and left for dead at her own wedding by her own husband david carridineand his gang aka dvas deadly viper assissination squad played by lucy lui who is hot in this film vivica fox who is also hotdarryl hanna same comment as the other two and michael madson after waking serveral years later from a coma the bride regains her strenth and sets out to seek revenge on dvas and anyone else who gets in her way but her main focus is to  there are alot of comparisons to bruce lee films in this movie like the yellow and black motorcycle suit thurman wears  they are the same colors lee wore in game of death but i wouldnt say this film was ripping off any of lees films if anything celebrating them  all together with nonstop action excellent marial arts training potrayed by the actors and of course tarantino humor i would say vol 1 is really worth seeing for action lovers  i cant wait til vol 2 comes out in april,cruel
ok i know quentin tarantino makes deliberately extreme movies i know he wants his works to be trash very hard i know he wants to be miles and miles away from classic hollywood products but i dont understand why so many people consider him a geniusmaybe im one of the few persons  who doesnt like his style nevertheless i think his movies and this one above all are terrifying i dont consider funny seeing flying heads and blood everywhere every scene is extremely violent and disgusting many people say that the harder tarantino pushes each detail the more comical he is for me most of the audience dont understand he delivers caricatures the problem is that he gets instead the opposite effect like a praise and an excitement for violence really gratuitous in this film the story very weak is overwhelmed by flashinessits a difficult topic on one side i dont want to sound like a moralist on the other one i want to tell my opinion films like taxi driver or clockwork orange are very violent too but they are strong tales with strong stories i dont say violence in these movies is more acceptable but its functional to the plotfurthermore why telling tarantino is a master he always quotes bruce lee he quotes or copy ideas from john woo and sergio leone he recreates sets and situations already seen in b movies he goes on paying tributes why doesnt he himself invent something,cruel
cant say its bad for its genre but for me it didnt live up to the hype i can see how it was cool but this isnt the kind of movie that id want to watch over and over again because its that goodi think tarantinos done better,cruel
this movie infuses all thats good about action movies sexy babe star samurai swords and lots of gore tarantino at his best cant wait untill part 2 the reason that makes this movie spectacular is that it can both be funny and serous at the same time the only bad part is the seen that is black and white for some stupid reason hopefully it will all be in full color on the dvd,cruel
im not going to post much about this film other than the fact that i wasted 850 to sit and watch two and some odd hours of the various wretched pieces of pop culture that have notsurprisingly become the epitome of all thats fun and cool in todays entertainment world thrown together are some of the most sick and brutally violent images ive seen wherein the purpose was simply to shock and entertain i was mislead into thinking this would be an homage of sorts to the old kungfu films of the 70s or something of that nature but all i witnessed was one needless chopping of appendage after another blood spewed almost out of the screen onto my lap and i felt sick to my stomach not simply because the images were disgusting to me but that this brutality had not one single purpose to the entire story not a single reason for this kind of violence to strengthen the plot or enhance motivation structure or character development this film is made for people who simply love seeing people tortured mutilated or just plain sliced into bloody pieces for no apparent reason at all,cruel
amazing film definitely one of tarantinos best if not his best this film is basically flawless and i cant believe some people dislike this film the action scenes are great and the music is exceptional definitely one of the best things about tarantino has done martial artssamurai fans proud and it is great to see references to past tarantino flicks aswell as early martial arts flicks i hope vol 2 is on par with this everyone should see this flick enough said,cruel
the movie wasnt what i expected it to be it missed some essential elements the dialogue and the subtle transition between the songs a part of this is compensated by the cartoon and japanese martial art shown in a way which isnt very common for hollywood productions the excessive use of blood in the movie makes it very clear that what you are viewing isnt real previous movies of tarrentino are more realistic thus having a bigger impact but the use of this much blood gives it an new edge watching this movie inspires me to view a japanese martial art movie since this must have been a big inspiration for tarrentinowhen reading the different comments i get the impression everybody likes the movie because tarrentino made it i wonder if everybody likes this movie this much if it were produced by somebody elseits a good movie and you should certainly go and view it but dont expect to much of it7510,cruel
i know  every time we get a tarantino film we get those who love it and those who dont  those who praise it as a hallmark of cinematic stylistics and those who think its a pretentious piece of poop  well guess what up until this film i wasnt part of the latter group but mr tarantino went and screwed himself up  written as a homage to the samurai films of the 60s lacked substance which was not the case in pulp fiction or resevoir dogs  this movie was totally lacking plot and tarantino thought he could make up for it by shoving in a feminist edge and story line couple it with admittedly excellent direction the shot setups and colourization were awesome and he expects to get praise  well he did  tarantino went out there continuing on his trend of rethinking the film genres  first it was gangster films resevoir dogs and pulp fiction and then it was blaxploitation  why does he resurrect these dead film genres and skewer their traditions  to get attention  once all the commentary has been said he can go in and make it seem like hes brilliant  the guys a great director but hes a lousy writer  this film took a terrible waferthin plot mixed it with a storyline that most critics would be afraid to disapprove of and threw in some great miseenscene  and for this hes one of the greats  no sorry  the greats made their own classics   they didnt pick on genres already gone by in a pointless fashion but hell continue to do this and people will continue to praise it or not,cruel
i absolutely loved  i am 51 years old and am a woman  i do not really enjoy violence at all but to me this was not violent  it was a kind of existentialism that had to do more with feelings and an eye for an eye kind attitudewhich us women have been watching men do at the movies for years  i am afraid that most men that i have spoken to that have seen this movie do not like it  i am soooooooooo disappointed in them it was so cool that tarantino make the blood shoot out ridiculously that it was art  we have all grown up on violence and it cannot be swept under the rug but it can be made fun of  humor is said to work when we say or show something or say something that is really true but it is sneaked in is satire in a most entertaining form i am an artist and have seen many many movies  i loved this movie  the very next day that i saw this movie i looked up stuff to read about 2 and on this site ran across the ending  i loved reading about the ending and it did not ruin it for me and cant wait to see the sequel i cant understand why so many men like seeing the samari genre for about 35 years now and couldnt get enough and here is one of the best special effects sword slicingflying through the airgood vs evilvehicle i have ever seen oh i saw it twice and am buying the dvd tonight,cruel
i hate qt films  especially reservoir dogs which bores and baffles me found pulp fiction perversely funny but still went to see kb out of a sense of duty what an amazing sense of narrative the film has  it keeps on truckin you might say and what a rich hook of an endingand yet and yet  it smells like the ulysses of cinema gee i can sneak in yet more thousands of sly references to other movies aint i the clever guy there is something byzantine and decadent about the whole adventure from soundtrack to fight scenes to regendering genres cant wait for kb 2  and how surprising that is,cruel
i was skeptical when i first saw the trailer i thought quentin tarantino was going to use to old american recipe and make a kung fu flick like van damme or somethingbut has pleasantly surprised me when i saw it on the premiere daytarantino leaves behind the shades blacks suits royalewithcheese and madonna and goes for something really freshof course there is presence of martial arts but its part of a bigger combo got elements of an epic movie martial arts flick western even anime mixing it with old school music action beats japaneselatinodisco remixesavoid it if youre too stuck up on the classic and predictable movie styles and afraid to try something new like my parents otherwise go see right awaytarantino made something really original again and i just cant wait for volume twothe master t score  out of 5,cruel
very good movie  although it wasnt as good as pulp fiction this movie hopefully marks a comeback for director quentin tarantino  the movie has a unique style that makes it interesting to watch  the movie wouldnt be what it is without the touch of its director  the movie incorporates anime as well as black and white through a few portions of it  this movie being an actiondrama caters well to its target demographic of men in their 20s  30s or so  that said the violence is to say the least somewhat gratuitous  even so the spraying blood and limbs being chopped off gives the movie a sense of sick hilarity  i laughed more than a few times at the violence i enjoyed the movie overall and i look forward to seeing volume 2,cruel
not great no volume 1 is a very fine piece of entertainment the visuals are often brilliant a notable example being the transition into anime tarantino splashes blood like paint and has no qualms about fullon decapitation and dismemberment there are gruesome parts parts that make you squirm but mainly its the acrobatic kungfu and selfconscious visuals lights go out for no reason other than style for instance that keep you entertained the script is nothing special there are clever parts like the way some characters are built up and tarantino once again plays around with the timeline to good effect but the acting doesnt draw you in it doesnt seem that tarantino particularly wants you to care about these characters so the film certainly has a unique appeal and is certainly worth watching but its too long perhaps volume 2 will prove otherwise but seems an exercise in style and entertainment and on that level it clearly succeeds but its doubtful whether itll leave a lasting impression,cruel
this is one of the crappiest movies ive ever seeni watched it till the endto see if it gets betterbut it only gets worserthis movie is just crapthe movie is way overratedthis rating was the reason why i watched iti regret my decision,cruel
as much as i think this is 2003s most enjoyable film it is difficult to assess storywise because we have yet to wait for its second volume so i wouldnt call it best of 2003 it has some pretty interesting music tied in to its images the crazy 88 battle there were only 27 of the ukoza guards is supercharged beautifully shot and is guaranteed to make you grit your teeth and watch closely i love the silhouettes fighting against the blue background as in all tarantino this film has nonlinear storytelling and it is also difficult to praise or criticize him for constructing the script this way there might be some plants in vol 1 taht would get payed off in vol 2  who knows but the last thing that bill says in the end is guaranteed to keep fans of this one waiting anxiously for vol 2 i give it a 10 out of 10 because of how exciting it is to watch it is not nonstop action per se but i cant complain of the movies pacing either see it,cruel
i know many people here seem to think of tarantino as a god amongst directors  would be pretty good in my book if it werent for two things he always does  the first is that he always seems to put music in a scene where it doesnt fit  certain types of music work in certain scenes and other types do not  i can live with it though because hes an artist it just seems like he tries too hard to make it artsy  but what kills me the most no pun intended is that his movies this one in particular just end up being a huge bloodfest  half of this movie doesnt even need to be in colour it could have been monochrome red and itd look the same  i would like to say that production ig did an awesome job with the anime sequence even though it was just as gory as the rest,cruel
warningthe following review may give away minor albeit slightly obvious details on the story and plotwarningthe film was spectacular and although tarantino fans might take a while to adjust to seeing lethal swordwielding assassins instead of his usual gangsters it does work at the very beginning were treated to a spectacular showdown with deadly knife fights to match but there does seem to be something morally wrong with the bride taking out her terrible revenge regardless of the fact that her opponents young daughter is watchingas good as the film is it really is shockingly violent and difficult to watch sometimes particularly a graphic scene involving the main character biting off someones tonguethere is a spectacular showdown at the end featuring uma thurman vs the crazy 88 which should win best choereography at the oscarswatch the movie if you are not squeemish not even a little bit,cruel
cant really say if this movie is good or not because half of it is missing what we get is a splatter samurai movie with lots of wellchoreographed sword fighting scenes lots of dismembered bodies lots of blood lots of very dry gutwrenching humour and the coolest uma thurman ever what we dont get is a decent movie because some greedy guy somewhere decided to split the movie in two parts so that they could make more money with it which is especially annoying as they could well have edited 1015 minutes out of this part to make a 3 12hour movie total  indian filmmakers do that all the timeanyway ill give the film a proper rating after ive seen part 2 which will probably be in a few months as it stands at the moment a disconected fragment of a splatter comic thats been turned into a film its only uma thurman that warrants a 710,cruel
from the opening shot till the credits this movie is a roller coaster ride of emotions too much blood and violence though more gore than i would have liked to see all in all its a very good movie a very cool one indeedbravo uma for your characterizationi insist too much delimbing and decapitationsthank god tarantino used black and white in one of the most violent scenes if that wasnt the case it would have been a bloody messnice ending wait till you see how the movie ends it really leaves you breathless,cruel
i might include the odd tagline spoilerwhat a truly terrible film the originality creativity and black humor that was easily seen in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction is complete lost in tarantinos current manifestation is completely devoid of plot character development and dialogue  the line my names buck and im here to f k would have to be the epitome of the filmits stunted stunt scenes and gratuitously violent overtones drip veritable mozzarella as gallons of splattering blood gush from one amputation to the next  im amazed that the main characters didnt chomp on the severed appendages  i havent seen this many lost limbs since night of the living deadat any rate his split screen camera tricks colour to blacknwhite imagery and homage to several obvious blockbusters do nothing to fatten this already ricepaper thin movie my advice is to stay in save your hard earned cash on some takeaway sushi and watch the reruns of any kungfu 70s action sitcom  youll get less gore more realistic martial arts and better oriental nibbles that arent as processed as this cheesy loser,cruel
literally obscene amount of beheading and delimbing  a waterpark of gore  blood fountaining frequently  in some scenes it is presented more stylistically  in other scenes it is presented more realistically with more disturbing effect  fewer fight scenes than i expected but it wouldve been hard to cram more in without sacrificing the movies balance  so this isnt really a criticism just a comment  little plot but you shouldve been warned not to expect that out of this moviean action movie makes up for its rudimentary plot with amazing fight sequences colorful characters and occasional comedy  this movie hits in spots but falls a little short overall  the fight sequences are okay but nothing that hasnt been done before and better in a thousand hong kong kung fu movies twenty years ago  umas wire work is particularly sketchy although its a shame that i have to say that because ive seen what somebody looks like the first time on a wire and to even get to the point she did must have required a lot of practice  shes also much sloppier with a sword than a superassassin ought to beis supposed to be tarantinos homage to the kungfu flicks he loved as a kid and homage it iswith all the good and bad that the word implies  there are times in the movie when its obvious that a particular element was thrown in just because its expected by the genre  an example is when in the middle of a fight scene uma leapsflies onto a secondfloor balcony a la crouching tiger  using wires to float a character is a classic hong kong effect but for some reason in it feels like it was stuck in just for that reason its a classic hong kong effect this is an homage so it has to be in there somewhere  its kind of cool to see uma thurman doing these effects instead of michelle yao or some other asian actress that weve never heard of but its obvious that shes out of her element in some of the stuntshas a lot of gore  it has more gore than it needs to tarantino is obviously trying to create some effect in his audience  i was a little turned off by it frankly  you can take excessive gore a number of ways  you can do it cartooney like friday the 13th in which case it loses some of its impact  you can do it ultrarealistic like natural born killers or saving private ryan in which case it has a strong impact that hopefully ties into a plot or some point that the film maker is trying to make that justifies the violence  but in tarantino presents inyourface overthetop fountainsofblood violence without a strong plot or point to back it up  it seemed juvenile to methere are a few good scenes in  the fight between uma and lucy lius bodyguard the female with the spiked ball on a chain is pretty wellchoreographed and executed  the fight between uma and lucy liu is less physical and more psychological and mental but still strongright up until the end when spoiler deleted  eww  theres another great moment when after killing hundreds of his cohenchmen uma hacks sections off of the last henchmans sword while he cowers  he drops the decapitated hilt and holds up his hands upon which she puts him over her knee then spanks him with the flat of her blade saying this is what you get for playing with yakuza  now go home to your mother  the sheriff who refers to his deputy as son number one presumably its really his son and who has a row of spare sunglasses on his dash board is a great character even though hes only onscreen for five minutes in the whole movieis punctuated with clever or entertaining moments but overall id say its a rental  definitely not a mustsee,cruel
i thought it was rubbish all the way through it was jumping back to when she was not in the  coma so out of 10 i will give it a  510 because some of the moves where quite cool so if you like films that confused you watch this one and please tell what the hell there on about,cruel
well in my opinion the director is genius the movie has no plot whatsoever and yet the director finds a great way of telling it the movie is divided to chapters as every chapter is getting you further down the plot the thing is that there is no plot other than my man tried to kill me at the wedding so now ill just go and kick his basthe bas kicking is not bad although it isnt exactly good it shows that a lot of effort was put into the making of this film but i fear it was a waste since it really tells you nothing at all and tries to tell you things anyway the deadly bride doesnt even have a namein the film the bride is going through all of the evil characters and kill them systematically theres a lot of blood more blood some blood to go with it and a few blades and fights the only innovative fight is the first one after that you are may be excused theres also a scene that features some really bad anime the creators probably wanted to give it their own touch but they ended up with a really bad anime scene during which i only wished it was overthe soundtrack is really nice though well made and picked overall this movie is really well produced but it has nothing to offer today topnotch effects are not enough i fear watch it if youre into tons of blood and gore that doesnt let plot get in the way510,cruel
this audacious diamond references all my favourite films  lady snowblood female convict scorpion enter the dragon master of the flying guillotine thriller et al  and mainstreams themthats clever and it takes quite a talent to do that effectively and still produce a film with a single voicetarantino take a bowi know why the scene with sonny chiba is so long but it hurts the movie buddy and sonny would have still been as godly in half the timeas ive seen the coloured climax i prefer that so i hope others get to see it too censorship dictating the tonal appearance of a movie sucks still great scene anywaythe music carried me back to the 70s and 80s especially the cues referencing and paying hommage to japanese diva flickssimply because qt made the thing he gets my respect because hey he could be taking big dollars and making crappola like charlies angels too much,cruel
charlies angels has nothing on this onenot only was this movie stylin but it still had the tarrentino influences and twists those of you who say this movie was blah or not original lack exactly what you should all like about this movie the color and excitment this film is an ode to the old school japanese samurai movies that tarrentino is a huge fan of and while some may think he sold out with high profile actresses they were perfect for the parts they completed the feel of the movie and uma kicks ass more times than cameron diaz in both angels movies combined tarrentino took amazing artistic chances with this film and suceeded wonderfully even the anim was so welldone and i have never been a fan of asianinspired cartoons tarrentinos crazy so you all should expect when walking into the theater if youre not back for the second and last installment no one will miss you but youll be missing out on great demented work of art,cruel
quentin tarantinos fourth film starts as it means to go on the film fades in on a broken black and white uma thurman wheezing and coughing whilst listening to her former lover intone his parting words she tries to speak but before she can fully form her sentence bill the omnipotent david carradine levels his gun at her head and starts the bride on her path to vengeance cue nancy sinatra and some of the most mournful slow opening credits ive ever seen  the relationship between music and image is neatly encapsulated and tarantino makes it clear hes working at his own paceis about revenge pure and simple we learn just enough about our heroine in this part to understand that her retribution is just and deserved like a million nameless cowboys in a million spaghetti westerns she is a living instrument of fate thankfully tarantinos deft direction and thurmans warm charismatic performance are more than up to the archetype carrying it with consummate easeand tarantino instead choose to focus his attention on the rogues gallery of adversaries lucy lius character oren ishii has her origins relayed through a series of split screen sketches and a braveu anime sequence courtesy of studio ig the talented individuals behind blood the last vampire and the ghost in the shell series it is perhaps this scene that best illustrates tarantinos objective with his fourth film the marrying of various cult flavours the world over here sublime sketchy fluid animated bloodletting is scored to operatic italian western themes and it works beautifullyas with his previous pieces tarantino is able to take disparate elements from world cinema and spin them into a cohesive whole with his own imprint firmly stamped on every frame here its european westerns jidei geki films yakuza and 70s kung fu epics and whilst an understanding isnt essential it certainly helps the tone is expansive and melodramatic with a heavy helping of gallows humourwhats most impressive about though is that the action and execution goes beyond reference it actually matches what its paying homage to the fights and action sequences have that illusive rhythm that eludes most western attempts to copy this unique brand of cinemawhats astounding though is tarantinos sheer mastery of the tempo he effortlessly shifts through several different types of combat without it ever jarring a fantastic achievement first time out on the action scene its almost like being a fan of john woos 70s comedy of eras and then watching a better tomorrow you never knew the man had it in him obviously a good portion of the kudos must be laid at master yuen woo pings door he of matrix and crouching tiger fame but tarantinos own voice and style are clearly visibleas ever tarantino breathes new life into a group of actors thought past their best the two that stand out the most are the street fighter himself sonny chiba and kung fus david carradine chiba best known for playing stoic emotionless killing machines bleeds warmth as hattori hanzo an accomplice for the bride his performance combines weary humour and a genuine regal air carradine as the neverseen bill is perfect as the behindthescenes puppet master quite the feat considering you only ever see his feet and handsin all is for my money an unqualified success although certainly not a film i could wholeheartedly recommend to anyone it is certainly a film of true quality if youve ever stayed up late to catch a godzilla flick or marvelled at the sheer elegiac comedic woe of leones films then this is the movie for you as close to an instant masterpiece as ive ever seen,cruel
tarantino wants his audience to be so in love with technique of the film without getting the audience to react to it it poses as a bmovie but it isnt a bmovie bmovies have kinetic flair and high wire gusto this film is simply a pile shaw brothers references among others in reservoir dogs when mr blonde sliced the cops ear off to pop tunes we were affected by it tarantino wasnt just saying look at me look what i can do he was actually showing us what he could do this film hints at something better than it is without showing us this something also it is a cartoon tarantinos previous films looked at the characters with an ironically detached style making it amusing crime movies would always show us thugs getting their heads blown off without any imagination with pulp fiction tarantino was curious he wondered how do the gangsters get rid of the corpses do they hire someone what if their wife comes home and finds the corpse with these thoughts tarantino struck upon brilliance cheerfully playing with gangster cliches now tarantino is trapped in these cliches delivering characters and scenarios of the same artistic quality of the filmmakers he was originally parodorizing,cruel
just came back from the movie ive seen a lot of good comments and some people even praising the mind blowing action sceneshave you ever seen the huge canvas arts that are done by great artists it may be simply two lines of paint but considered a master piece maybe sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars but if i do the same no body would even want to consider it since i am not a great artist  the difference is that the great artist did draw those lines with a purpose to describe something but i simply draw that to make moneywhen we look at the movie thats the idea came to me the movie would have rated very low if its attached to an amateur directors name but knowing torentino we start to see the purpose of those amateur like rendorations of the storythe story not a powerful story to tell we almost know what the story its very predictable and some times looks like a hindi movie i think the story is trying to take a road between abstract movie and a direct story and hence loose its powerfights not very convincing it is trying to establish an honorable killing code but i cannot see it as a very good success story as the director is lost between reality and abstraction we audience also lost in several scenes  for example those fountains of blood that keep on showering when ever a limb is chopped is something not natural i would have laughed if this happened in pulp fiction but was not so sure whether its done purposely or just a bad special effects seen i can see that torentino trying to establish a japanese comic story like no pun intended style in those fights but that effort has not given enough fruits and does not distinguish these fights from any other hong kong based kungfu movieacting i was never an uma thurman fan i always thought she over act in her movies i dont think she is doing any good for this movie either the acting is very shallow and shows no emotion i think she took the this bride is not an emotional person statement literary ant try to avoid showing any emotion at all  but i did like the lucy lou acting she was showing that ruthless killer character very well also her body guard i think lucy lou would have been a better selection for the main role what an asian heroin character no way no we are not resists but no way an asian for main character pun intendedcamera hmm i am no expert on this but i cannot see anything exceptional in camera side direction there are few places i liked the way the movie is presented but i am sure torentino has more talent than we could see it in this picture not the best one from him i would consider as an experiment gone wrong by torentino he was trying to develop a different style of story telling as always but this time its not a success any one seen indian general formula movies would find this movie is such a movie minus the songs and the boy friendnot the best movie ive seen i can give 710 thats assuming this as an experiment gone wrong if i ever see torentino speaking this otherwise will change the vote to 510ps i wonder which air line allow samurai swords in the cabinpsps plsase excuse me for the language english is not my first language,cruel
this is actually a bit sad movie genius quentin tarantino has delivered a movie without any original elements almost everything here has been done before theres really nothing in it that i will remember for a long time no torturescenes including razors and ears no cripples this is a tribute to old samurai films such as those about lone wolf no wonder it feels unoriginalspoiler alert sure it includes plenty of gore a guy gets his intestines spilled all over the floor in a caf a girl gets her arm cut off limbs dont really seem to follow natural laws in this film and they fly as if they had wings and blood literaly gushes out of severed arms legs throats whatevermany critics call this the most violent movie ever i have no idea why if they for example would take a look at some italian or japanese underground movies than i think they would change their minds and the violence in this movie is anyway so supernatural that you cant take it serious but the gore is also a problem with this movie its neither shocking nor very funny it is however very stylish but its not that entertaining that tarantino had to make a movie about itthis movie also has a couple of other problems the dialogue for example is not very smart not at all in fact especially not for being written by tarantino take for example the opening scene which includes a pretty horrible quarrel uma thurman isnt very convincing as the avenger and her passion for katanas is just ridicolousit does however include some good parts lucy liu is very good and the music is great fun the movie also has a lot of clever references to old samuraifilmsall in all this feels like a missed opportunity while it has got its good sides it often feels like lots of old flicks cut into one and isnt exactly a recipe for a masterpiece tarantino should go back to making more original and realistic films such as the excellent reservoir dogs and use his own imagination instead of stealing others610,cruel
i think this movie is excellent example of how to make a great movie if you dont have any idea about anything worth to be put in it storyline is so simple that you can surely say there isnt any murders revenge and thats it thats no story if this should be serious kungfu movie like some people said than someone has gone a way out of line because there wasnt any serious martial arts in this movie only parody otherwise this movie is very easy to watch soundtrack is one of the best acting cool directing perfect end is a simple cut in the story on the great spot surely worth watching,cruel
when i left the theater i wanted to go back in and watch this movie again i think many people missed what tarantino was trying to do with this film people focused on the blood and gore but ignored the style stylistically this is the best movie of all time no other movie has ever exploited a style to this degree this movie is what kung fu films have been trying to do for ever revenge  insane fighting spirituality impossible odds it has it all it is like watching a dream i watch a lot of wu tang movies and other kung fu films and i think is everything that they want to be if you liked i would also suggest watching the samurai jack movie stylistically it is a lot alike,cruel
i have spent so much time anticipating the new tarantino movie that at the moment i got my hands on i sat down to watch itunfortunately it was one of the most boring saturday nights i have ever had the film started promising and i braced myself for enjoyable time after the first half an hour however i started feeling physical pain from watching it it dragged on and on but led me nowhere only the fact that it was made by one of the cult directors of our time kept my eyes on the screen very boring,cruel
this movie really sucks a pile of selfindulgent pumped up xerox copies yes it is a bunch of masterfully crafted scenes that refer to anime bruce lee films spaghetti western and a lot of other art forms i like very much yes there was no shortage of cash invested in production and actors but there is no spirit putting characters together its like saying beautiful parts make a beautiful frankenstein monster every idea of those older styles is thrown in the vengeance hopeless honor learning moments but with a complete lack of mystique and most of the time as a poor excuse for cheap violence and masturbatory tarantinos self references cmon how much blood does a human body geyser out if you chop its head or puncture its intestines one time adds up the next spurting bodies were just hilarious the best parts for me were the choreographed musicaction scenes especially the last huge sword fight on the verge of being comic too ugly detail poor michael madsen thrown in at the end with some more senseless stupidity lines just to keep the tarantinesque air going sad,cruel
this is a really amusing homage to old kung fu movies visually spectacular will keep you interested in the development of the simple revenge plot i would recommend to see with surrealistic eye and surprise on how some of the very ridiculous lines seem to fit perfectly in the whole movie,cruel
quentin tarantino is the most influencial directors of our time and he has done some amazing movies i would say is his second best film compared to pulp fictionreservoir dogs the second volume will be spectacular the colors and the camera work for this film are just outstanding the best directing job i have seen in a while except stanley kubrick,cruel
i was entertained by this film it was better than 90 percent of what was showing in cinemas that week and it certainly wasnt a bad way to spend eight quid and two hours but i did have a nagging feeling all the way through it  why exactly was i crossing london in the rain was such a worldwide hype being generated and a very talented guy spending six years of his life and a hundred million bucks of hollywoods money if you add the cost of volumes 1 and 2 together for the cinematic equivalent of a camp tribute actmaybe im being unfair to tarantino a lot of film fans place unfair burdens on his shoulders because of his talent in the same way that people always want de niro to go all out in something like raging bull with tarantino people expect to see him cement his reputation as a world class talent by making films that show he is evolving and maturing quentin on the other hand seems only to want to make cool films that pay tribute to his favourite exploitation genres thats his choice and he can do no more than be true to himself i went to the pictures i paid my money and i was entertained so well played qt but there was definitely something missingvolume 1 is a revenge story stripped down to the very basic essentials true to the oriental and spaghetti western genres he is copying there is little backstory and no depth we get the story more or less straight with the bride uma thurman recovering from the almost successful attempt on her life to exact bloody vengeance on those responsible her former colleagues from an elite assassin squad the plot characterisation dialogue and style are deliberately cheesy serving only to advance the film a step or two to the next fight scene true to tarantinos core values the action is red in tooth and claw with swords hacking limbs and blood spurting preposterous tsunamis across the screen in the graphic style of shogun assassin and similar ilk this is all mounted in stunning style showing off tarantinos awesome command of film technique as well as brilliant cinematography and soundtrack its enjoyable but frankly not all that gripping the only moment of really nailbiting suspense was the brides fight with the macewielding teenage assassin i got to the end of the film having enjoyed it and definitely intending to see volume 2 but i certainly wasnt blown away by itthe law of diminishing returns seems to have set in here the talent of the director and the large budget obviously make this better than a lot of the original films but it doesnt really challenge the real masters in those genres and it surely isnt the best film that tarantino could have made compare that to a couple of films that were conceived and made on a fraction of the budget while tarantino was off making this  city of god and nine queens the south americans have obviously watched a lot of scorsese and con man films but they still manage to distil that into something new and vibrant which coheres into much better and more entertaining films than qt has managed this time city of god in particular completely rocks the screen and is certainly no pompous arthouse flick but it managed to tell a great story that actually has some relevance tarantino has the reputation he has because he opened peoples eyes to whats possible with a movie camera as well as entertaining us but at the moment there are other people stealing a march on him i find myself asking why tarantino doesnt want to really test himself and take a risk by trying to make something really challenging and ambitious there are great stories like james ellroys novel american tabloid that would make some of the greatest movies ever if someone could ever work out how to film them  is he afraid to give it a go even the genres he imitates so beautifully didnt always show such stunted ambition  leone made the good the bad and the ugly and broke the mould with once upon a time in america some samurai films attempt a little more depth like seven samurai and rantheres a reason why people like to see a great filmmaker make really classic films the same reason why they want a great singer to move on from storming the local karaoke bar to go and make a great record or a great athlete make the step up to the olympics thats where the real drama and entertainment is its frustrating when someone this good squanders his talent and thats what i fear tarantino is doinghis body of work so far includes a brash debut calling card with some awesome moments but still a little mechanical a superb cinematic compendium of ideas that wasnt quite a whole story a very good elmore leonard adaptation and a kung fu movie in twelve years quentins idols in the exploitation world could have produced that many films in a year if god forbid tarantino were run over by a bus tomorrow he would have ended his career without having once produced what we think he is capable of and that would be a shame the shame at the moment is that possibly the most exciting talent in film is not making the most exciting films,cruel
sometimes there comes a movie so splendid that the plot binds you to the seat other times there comes a movie so beautifully made that you doesnt care whether or not it has a real plot and sometimes there comes movies of this suchgarbagetoo much blood too much hacked off limbs to little plot and definitely no sympathy for the main characteruma thurman is ok  you have to give her that lucy liu is magnificent as always but they have nothing to base their acting upon the brilliance of tarantino has risen to his head and he has lost all contact to reality this movie has no right to exist and i can only imagine how many that would have needed the 55000000 morewill uma thurman survive vol 2 franklywho really gives a damn,cruel
this movie tries so hard to be this that and the other thing rolledinto one you end up with 0 i walked out during the supertiredpseudo anime sequence hommage without substance is justimitation   and the writing of this movie was basically pathetic   at least the first 45 minutes then i went to see die mommy diewhich was much more entertaining  ,cruel
has caused a stir among movie fans it hasnt polarized audiences the way matrixreloaded did earlier this year this is only the first of many comparisons to the matrix sequel but this was to be expected the majority of viewers went in to the movie expecting to love it this is due in no small part to quentin tarantinos ostentatious presentation of his brand name on this film i thought it was goofy enough for him to have the fourth film by quentin tarantino on all the trailers but this phrase replaces the directed by credit in the opening creditsthis is nothing new its fairly well established that tarantino is an obnoxious loudmouth who takes his method of assembling films out of pop culture snippets far too seriously i dont like quentin tarantino the man but try as i might i cant transfer that distaste to his movies yes reservoir dogs is nothing but hong kong heist movies injected with madonna references and other dialogue and imagery that tarantino included because he thinks its cool but it is cool its a thoroughly enjoyable movie then theres his tour de force pulp fiction which is the movie that made him a house hold name the film is clearly still juvenile and immature but i cant help but love it jackie brown is the other end of the spectrum a film where you can vividly picture tarantino behind the camera squinting in his effort to make a mature movie that is when hes not orgasaming over how genius he is to have cast robert deniro in a mostly silent role yet brown may be my favorite of the three moviesfrom the first announcement of the project was touted as being a grind house tribute a mishmash of cinematic influences tarantino supposedly spent his six year hiatus renewing his love affair with cinema it was clear that it was going to be something very different from his other movies i read the first draft of the script that was released online and had to love it despite the glaring departures from the tarantino form the script was very lax on dialogue and strong on action and by far the most ridiculous and the most fun while taking itself deadly serious i wanted to see the movie i was excited to see this samurai sword epic with exaggerated kung fu sound effects and ridiculous decapitationsthe undeniable truth is this is a good movie regardless of what your or my opinion is its a very well made movie even though youre aware that what youre seeing on the screen is ridiculous and outrageous and is an absolute parodyits never presented in that manner its all straightforward and executed in a very classy way a friend who saw the movie with me said that the opening credits sequence went on too long but i loved every second of it and as far as the anime sequence is concerned i thought it was unnecessary but very well done i cant agree with all the people calling tarantino a genius and pioneer and true artist for including the sequencethats exactly what he wantsa friend who wasnt a big fan of complained that tarantino feels the need to skew the chronology of all of his films just to be different and cool this is wrong reservoir dogs makes use of the various flashbacks to tell the story but that is of little consequence jackie brown only time shifts in one scene and that is only because elmore leonard made use of the device in his novel pulp fiction is the movie most people think of when confronted with tarantinos time shifting is the disjointed timeline in the movie arbitrary not at all if you reedited the film so that it played in chronological order the emotional impact would be all but erased the final scene would be vincent getting shot coming out of the bathroom you lose the emotional bookends that make the movie what it is the same goes for the movie wouldnt work if it was in chronological order i heard plenty of complaints about the seemingly random jumps backwards four years in time but they are the glue that hold the rest of the paper thin plot together the fight with vernita green would be a yawnfest if it had followed the cinematic wonder that is the showdown at the house of blue leavesnow the matrix parallels the house of blue leaves sequence is similar to the burly brawl in reloaded except for one key element real people are fighting it may be an over the top battle but it never becomes a videogame comparing the two fights brings up my favorite aspect of the blue leaves fight the majority of it is presented without music matrix obviously suffered from horrendous technopop music tarantino is well renowned for his musical selections in his film but he really shines when he knows how to use silence also both reloaded and feature the use of samurai swords in reloaded the swords are futile scratching a cheek at their most lethal in limbs are liberally severed from the rest of their bodies and foes are sliced all the way down the middle where the wachowskis wimped out in favor of cgi effects tarantino made a ballstothewall action sequence finally reloaded has one of the worst most laughable cliffhanger endings that i have ever seen many people i have spoken too disliked ending but i think that it couldnt have been more perfect the concluding sequence features the most impressive bouncing back and forth between different time frames that i have seen in recent memory instead of ending on a laughable note it ends on a powerful one even for me and i knew what was comingis extremely well executed bmovie schlock the plot characters and motivations are all superficial but tarantino once again proves to be a master of the frame the logistical implications behind the movies many impressive scenes are enough to tide film buffs over but is far from an empty shell,cruel
good opening and fab soundtrack from the start although i thought the nonchronological ordering was unnecessary to some extent good strong theme revenge i began to waiver between likedislike during the animation to me it smacked of ran out of time and money or couldnt be bothered any more although im perfectly sure that this was not the case i also thought that the fight between the bride and the crazy 88 was overlong verging on becoming boring and i did begin to wish that someone would just shoot her and wondered why noone did having said all that i just loved the gratuitous violence the limbchopping and blood spurting were terrific and the culmination of the fight between the bride and oren was one scene that will stay with me for a very long time truly inspired before i saw this film i was concerned about how it would end as i like a good endingespecially as i knew there would be a vol 2 but it ended very well and stands alone as a good movie vol 2 or not,cruel
tarantino made a piece of art the manga scene was brilliant few people have done it and it was perfect the soundtrack is also great when you listen bang bang from nancy sinatra youll remember the opening scene directly i cant wait for volume two,cruel
didnt rate this film at allactions way over the top and the plots flimsy at bestas for mixing it up like plup fiction i think thats getting a bit old hat now rent an old manga or japanese kung fu film and save your dosh,cruel
the most important fact to keep in mind about this movie is that it is exactly what it is and makes no pretense to be anything else  if you are looking for deep philosophy or drama you are looking for a different movie vol1 aims to be an action filled story of vengeance and mayhem the actors or in most cases actresses are wonderful in their performances yes some of the dialog seems awkward but it is not written as realistic dialog it is written for this movie which is not realistic either these characters talk as the stereotypes they portray  the honorable vengeful hero the female blacksploitation action hero and the lord of the japanese underworld  tarantino deserves props for this highly stylized piece not to mention it is nice to see some american actresses really stepping up to the plate in an action film for once without the previous notions of them needing to be sexy or alluring  all three of the fighting women in this piece hold their own and get down and dirty  finally there is only one thing to do sit back and hope that he can deliver on the sequel  910 stars,cruel
i could write so very many pages on and still not cover everything that is buzzing around my tiny mind this is a film that is thought provoking but not in the way you would expecti sat for hours wondering what tarantino was on when he made this he randomly cuts from one style of filming to another without any kind of warning but this is not a bad thing because somehow it all works everything he does with the style of the film is pulled off with ease switching from full colour to black  white back to colour then to blue with silhouettes and even at one point to animationtarantino is one of very few men who would dare to try something like his and probably the only man who could pull it off as well as he did without audiences laughing in his facealso has a great 70s feel to it from everything to the soundtrack to the yellow title cards and subtitles which although slightly cheesy at times still makes it a fun film to watchthere is one thing however that i cant decide there was lots and lots and lots etc of blood shed in this movie which is fine people are going to bleed if you hack their limbs off but is it really going to shoot out over 30 metres at a rate of a pint a second this little gripe still didnt take anything away from the fact that this is a fantastic movie but i just cannot make my mind up whether qt was being ott or doing it tongue in cheekeither way im sure tarantino knew what he was doing entertaining audiences and that is exactly what he did9510,cruel
this is my first comment on imdb after watching the average matrix reloaded and the disappointing matrix revolutions i watched this one i have heard a lot of things about this movie and i knew what to expectthe violence especially the blood fountains and the fights are so unrealistic that you have basically two options leave the theater and puke or start laughing if you think you can laugh about such things you will find this movie absolutely fantastic if not stay outumas fight against the crazy 88 is so wonderful filmed that it shows that neos fight against the hundreds of smiths in matrix 2 is just a pure special effects hoax and id like to thank quentin tarantino for showing this in my opinion this fight alone is worth watching the movieto summarize my feelings i had id like to paraphrase a line of matrix 2 the movie starts to simply each minute creates a new effect you begin to ask why what is the reason for this soon the why and the reason are gone and all that is left is the feeling itselfso just enjoy this movie and dont ask why there is all that violence,cruel
dont read this if you dont want the plot spoiled a little bitwell its definitely tarantino and as it goes i also think its a little too stylized in the words of my roommate the bloody action scenes are a cross between old school kung fu films like rikioh the story of ricky and monty python in essence i think it was overdone in some places  an attempt to make the film too campy it was obvious the director tarantino was striving to achieve the campiness of originalsalso that whole thing about the comaraping and buck  unnecessary albeit it does explain how she got out of the hospital and overcame atrophy but that could have been done in dozens of other ways without such gratuitous sexandviolence nonsense and if i thought it was excessive and i dont mind the intestine scenes in any of the kung fu films ive seen then i can only imagine what other folks thought  especially the italians i was with in firenze who dont mind allout sex scenes but edit the least bit of blood from everythinghowever this didnt mar the cinematography or story i came away knowing i had seen a movie and even if i never suspended disbelief enough to fully lose myself in the brides suffering or whatever i did enjoy a great revenge story plus it had all the classics the one man or woman army against incredible odds the swordblade reflection shot the ridiculous asian weaponry the chainballsickle minus the sickle that go go yubari had and that shot of uma from underneath the glass dance floor was cool tooyes this movie was a great time and i highly recommend it to anyone who thinks that they can stomach it its well done and enjoyable so go see it or if thats not an option at least rent it when it comes out on dvd or video,cruel
was a great movie yeah it is extremely bloody but its still good while it is an action film it is somewhat of a satire the way blood exits a body in some parts the only thing that made me give this a 9 instead of a 10 was the overthetop disturbing gory animation sequence but beside that sequence the film is excellent,cruel
ok i admit i had my reservations about being an avid fan of quentins previous film this movie seemed to me like it was gona be below par but everyone says that and when they see it their hypothesis dont ring true what is is a masterpiece at first it seems its all style over content but i think the content is excellent too thin and patchy maybe but still excellent the film contains several moments of powerful emotion such as when thurmans bride realises she has lost her baby after waking from her coma or the final showdown between her and oren that was hard to watch you have these two women who you presume hate each other but theres also a respect there which makes it just that little bit hard fro them to except that they have to kill one another ok i know that basically this film is fun and most emotion plays second fiddle to the action but its still therethe violence level is high its one of the most violent films ive seen but it seems strange to say but lots of the violence is well beautiful perhaps its the fact that lots of it is commited by women something we are not used to seeing and im not saying that because they are women the violence isnt as genuine or powerful but theres just something there that you dont generally see in movies when two guys fight not in western movies anyway uma therman and lucy lui especially possess a grace and dignity that pervades through their violencebasically this film is fun escapism but that doesnt mean that it has to be emotionally sterile it oozes emotion violence is the brides emotion roll on volume 2,cruel
the ultimate incarnation of style over substance a style so pure and fueled out of an unbridled love for the cinematic form that one can not help but admire tarantinos technique sure its basically a glorified bmovie uncontaminated by substance but heck  its cool the cliffhanger ending is painfully anticlimatic though must see volume two,cruel
i was skimming through some of the comments of others and came to the conclusion that the ones who disliked vol 1 were more plotoriented than the ones who likedloved it if you disregard the meagre plot and just let the movie wash over you given when not fond of violence or fighting scenes then this just is not your cup of tea youll have a good good time comment on the missing explanation of the brides and her familys massacre  i might be totally wrong of course but the obvious explanation is that she was part of the deadly viper squad then quit them and settled down but her former colleagues werent too happy with her choice boom but imo this movie doesnt require endless explanation its just good old revenge a nice bit of japanese dialogue love the language visually beautiful scenes and i walked out of the theatre well delighted not taught but very delighted if you dont feel the need to overanalyze this is your movie,cruel
im not the wildest fan of tarantino movies but id definitelywatch pulp fiction or reservoir dogs anytime against this background was a disappointment i simply dont understand whats with the obsession of putting people fly all the time while fighting im not sure was it matrix that started this phenomena but i think weve had enough of that alreadythere were funny moments and even supposedly disgusting themes were presented in such a way you noticed laughing along with the crowd thats a definite plus  is kind of violent but in a humorous waythe first 15 minutes of the movie kept me waiting for an intriguing plot but id soon understand that i was going to get hackandslash for the whole sum of my movie ticket in fact there are no particular details of interest to mention  in my opinion the plot was basically empty thats very sad since qts previous movies gave a lot of chewing and made you look the film all over again to get a better grip of things happening on the scene while pulp fiction and reservoir dogs would get a 9 out of 10 grade id give a mere 6,cruel
qt is to film what steven king is to literature if you like king books youll like its like watching somebody else play a video game for 90 minutes sorry but thats about as good as it getsi kept expecting more but it just didnt deliver at alland now its a soap opera with 2 more contractual installments due oh i can hardlyyawnwait for those monty python did the squirting blood thing about 30 years agoand theirs always hit the mark ie funny not just a morbid display and unlike the gruesome chainsaw sequence in scarface  i still remember that scene angel was my friend  is mostly unmemorable and bland,cruel
having seen today i think quentin tarantino is in danger of remaining a 90s icon instead of assuming his rightful place in the pantheon of great film directors you get the feeling that the weight of expectation from his legion of fans is now too much for tarantino and is stifling his creativity much the same as george lucas with the last two star wars flicksthe main problem with is that it is all homage and nothing else you take away the references to kung fu samurai and female blaxploitation films and any other obscure genres that i might have missed and the whole edifice comes crashing down the references are none too subtle and in the end you feel like youre watching a comedy show thats parodying these genresuses techniques that weve seen before in tarantino movies such as the nonlinear plot but here they do not serve any purpose then there are things that are sadly lacking instead of the smart sassy dialogue of reservoir dogs and pulp fiction we get the hokey martial arts mumbo jumbo yeah i know its supposed to be a reference to kung fu movies having a couple of women call each other bitch is about as clever as it getsand really i think quentin needs to get counselling for his foot fetish before it gets out of hand instead of gratuitous nudity of which there was ample opportunity to display in the film we are treated to several loving closeups of uma thurmans toesdespite all this i still enjoyed the film tarantino has captured the essence of the genres he is paying homage to  i dont think anyone else could have done it so well the fight scenes are ok and the decapitations and arterial bleeding are as good as ive seen in any samurai film and chiaki kuriyama is genuinely creepy as the teenage killer,cruel
brilliant the film contains typical quentin tarantino hallmarks of black humour ultraviolence improbable story narrated and populated by over the top absurd flawed and ultimately totally  human characters and unforgetable action sequenceswhat really impressed me was the detail the film is bricolage writ large postmodern pastiche tarantino is a brilliant postmodern semiotic architect deconstructing is the wrong word here though its always used incorrectly in this context disassembling is better tarantino excels at disassembling low culture film and media  from star trek to mcdonalds film noir to anime from hong kong action vintage kungfu to kitsch pop music  painstakingly dissecting each into its most elementary form and then reassembling these symbols with new coherence and meaning into his own film each element form or style he lifts from b movie culture becomes an isolated symbol removed from its original context moving it into a new context it retains some all or none of its original meaning gains new context dependent meaning and becomes part of a new gestalt  that of the quentin tarantino film tarantinos comprehensive understanding of his low culture source material and the mechanics of his narrative allow him to populate his film with excessive richness but with total economy and consistency what you get is a disney world effect  thrilling stimulating richly detailed and at times disorienting  but fabulously entertaining academically and personally i enjoy and appreciate this type of work  which makes this one of if not the best film ive seen in the last 3 years but i dont expect most to agree with mecant wait for the second one cant wait to see this one again,cruel
as expected quentin tarantino hits bulls eye with it is a glorious mix of genres from super violent manga to almost traditional samurai movies all blended with perfection with the well known tarantino style saturating the film you leave the cinema with a big smile on your face looking forward to the sequel during the movie you cant help but agreeing in the quote at the beginning revenge is a dish best served cold i want more thats for sure,cruel
this film was the absolute bomb  uma at her best  the yellowhaired warrior definitely kicked ass  she was brilliant in this one though most people think qts films are a little weird and too eccentric i love the way he mixes his scenes around  pay attention and learn  hes so unique i also love the way some of the movie was animated  sheer brilliancethough some say it is plotless they need to use their imagination to fill in the blank spots  being that qt leaves so much to the imagination i am curious to see what vol2 is all about  im predicting flashbacks to the yellowhaired warrior aka the brides past bills origins and the start of his deadly assassin squadso go see this one have an open mind and be prepared to indulge yourself in unrequitiable voilenceyou will leave the theater feeling vindicated  i promise,cruel
this movie was so bad it was funny qt needs to get over himself and stop trying to be cool yes i did get the movie and there really was nothing new the whole structure was trite he seems to use the old nonlinear style of cutting to add interest and intrique to a film that has no soul maybe he should have just combined vol 1 and vol 2 and make a really great film,cruel
if you like this kind of film then you will love volume 1and when i say this kind of film i mean the twisted and surreal banality that only tarantino could weave into brilliancerecall how reservoir dogs started with a 15 minute argument over the meaning of madonnas song like a virgin later in that film the protagonists argue over who should be mr white as opposed to mr pinkalso recall pulp fiction where christopher walken relives his pow experiences with a wristwatch hidden up his butt later in the same film travolta and jackson debate in length over pork chopsnow remember how all of these inane moments were stitched together with graphic violence and also recall how tarantino weaves his plots with complete disregard for hollywood threeact formulae instead opting to add completely unpredictable dialogue and violence throughout his filmsthis eccentric and elegant narrative based on nothing meaningful but somehow molded into an unforgettable montage of revenge and redemption is what makes absolutely magnificentif you liked pulp fiction reservoir dogs or even dusk till dawn then go see  go now,cruel

after witnessing a brutal third film by quentin tarantino jackie brown i went into with little expectations due to the fact that qt made two brilliant films to start his career i was so psyched up for jackie brown unfortunately i was extremely disappointed even great actors like samuel l jackson and robert deniro couldnt save it i also questioned why miramax would spilt into two parts instead of making one film well folks my father always said money talks and bullst walksqt is back in full force directing a film that is right up there with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction the film opens with a quote from star trek ii the wrath of khan that says revenge is a dish that is best served cold revenge is the main theme in this movie just as honor is one of the central themes in reservoir dogs and redemption is the main theme of pulp fiction basic synopsis minor spoliers  the bride uma thurman looking hotter than ever is left for dead on her wedding day we dont see the full attack take place just bits and pieces she awakes from a four year coma and vows revenge on her attackers just to warn everyone this is one of the most goriest movies i have ever seen in a long time if you cant stand the sight of blood squirting and dismemberment this may not be the movie for you limbs and heads are disappearing faster than food on a plate of a person that hasnt eaten for days  multiple deaths in this one compared to very few in pulp fiction the scene where uma fights all of lucy lius army is one of the best action sequences ive seen since keanau reeves fought the smith clones in the matrix reloaded with quentin tarantino again proves what a skilled and gifted writer he is it leaves with a startling revelation at the end making us wait until february 2004 to see what goes down i noticed quite a lot of pulp fiction references in this one when uma draws the square in the air i laughed unfortunately my girlfriend has never seen pulp fiction or reservoir dogs she did enjoy this movie though just as i did welcome back quentin you just made one hell of a film right up to the level with the two masterpieces you started your directoral career with     stars out of 4,cruel
its been a fair while since a quinten tarantino movie famous for the groundbreaking pulp fiction and reservoir dogs tarantino later created jackie brown to mixed reviews vol 1 is his first major release since then and it manages to to be as fresh as his earlier hits as bloody as them and as groundbreaking in a senseits simply a story of revenge as uma thurmans character whose name isnt revealed except black mantra goes on a rampage to kill those responsible for ruining her wedding day by killing the entire congregation bar her and for the loss of her child as she was pregnant at the same time after a 4 year coma shes free to hunt the assassins down in vengeanceits never made clear yet who she is why shes so proficient herself as an assassin and why her wedding day was ruinedthe first volume as it is a 2 parter is simply about the first eventsthe story is simple but effective  and simultaneously rather strong with very stylish direction some original sequences such as anime and plenty of action with visceral lashings of the red stuff it is a bloody movie but its carried out in a comic book fashion so it never seems gory for the sake of itthe acting from thurman is exactly what it needs to be and to be honest its the same from everyone its supposed to be slightly corny and cheesy given the comicbook themethe only real downside in this movie is the characterisation or lack of you dont really care about thurman or anyone else i dont know if this is also intentional but the movie draws no real emotive response from the viewer you dont feel as involved as you perhaps shouldbut in saying all that its a fine piece of filmmaking and highly recommended,cruel
this is an extremely stylish and well directed action movie nothing more and nothing less i love but be warned this is not about a clever script or an intricate story no this is an old kungfu flick with the breaks off with good acting and a meticulous director at the helm as always this tarantino gem is very well edited creative and slick but it is also simple direct and not for the squeamishif you wouldnt be caught dead watching a karate flick or walked out on die hard this movie is not for you but if you are into some hardcore action with a sense of flair then this will be right up your alley910,cruel
booom wow what a ride i came out of the theatre with a wide grin attached to my face what a great flick i dont know much about movies but i know what i like and this was it tarantino mixes styles and surprises in all his moves the japanese animation part was weird but cool the black and white fighting scenes stylish and well done even the silhouette fighting was awesome the various transitions and special effects blended neatly in it was funny raw and well cooked even overcooked but with intention i loved the bmovie references spurtin blood limbs flying sword fights and super cool yellow bruce lee tracksuits the east meets the west in a superbly done flick by the now more than cult announced tarantino i have no problem joining the hype when im served with this kind of moviemaking i hope it wont be too long for vol 2 to reach theatres ill be waiting in agony 910,cruel
a bloody mess  quentin tarantino does himself in with overlong and cartoonishly violent martial arts scenes i thought that the blue leaves sequence was never going to end and an odd obsession with lead actress uma thurmans feet,cruel
this is a well made movie which is not necessarily the same thing as a good movie in fact this movie is very well directed by tarantinos usual iron hand in a succession of violent scenes some of them curiously impregnated by a poetical atmosphere revealed not only in the scenery that frames them but also by the excellent music and songs conveyed by the sound track which at times has moments of great lyricism most sequences pay visual tribute to japanese cartoons and the movie contains itself some sequences made up actually by cartoons in that style if we take for granted the usually unplausible scenes in this kind of movies e g the heroin coming of a coma and recovering almost at once all her physical fighting strength well appreciate the firm way by which this movie is made and will become fascinated by its exciting atmosphere there is a small flaw in the plot consisting in the lack of a quite understandable explanation for the attempted killing of the heroin at her wedding ceremony as well as for the actual killing of all the other people there since she was herself a killer maybe it was a squaring of accounts within the gang anyway this detail is not very important well some people might say that this movie purports a lot of gratuitous violence yes this may be true but if we read the daily papers or watch tv news bulletins dont we hear about lots of this kind of violence performed everyday in real life hasnt someone already said that mankind is creating a society of monsters with its consumerist values do these movies impel people towards crime and violence more than society does or on the contrary they arouse in most people a strong aversion for violent behaviour this is a vexed question for psychologists and sociologists to solve anyway personally im against all forms of violence and i never said this was or wasnt a good movie but i reaffirm that in pure formal terms disregarding its content its a well made movie and one more remarkable feature this is a feminist movie in a certain sense in fact i cant remember seeing a violent movie where womens roles are so much more important than mens like in this one,cruel

i have read little concerning how this movie was developed but i see it as an animemanga film with real actors  the violence is over the top and so cannot be seen as serious all those feet on the dance floor  the story unfolds brilliantly and at the end i just felt like felt  bring it on for no 2the episodic nature of the film is cooli keep seeing excellent fight seq in movies that i wish could be in a starwars film and this has those kind of seq  top fighting fun with the ugliest toes in town dont bother  dont put yourself out  good  unmissable,cruel
the sword that the brideuma uses is that the same one that butch bruce willis uses in pulp fiction if anyone else can think of some possibilities for kb2 please let me know ultimately 2 is just a little tv show called fox force 5i know how good my coffee is im the one who buys it,cruel
this film was simply awesome tarantino succeeds in making every second of the film an experience in itself although pulp fiction remains my favourite tarantino film has managed to wedge itself between pf and reservoir dogs into the second place however who knows maybe volume 2 will change my opinion once again anyhow is a cinematic festival embodying the tarantinesque or is it quentinesque philosophy that onscreen violence is the ultimate aesthetical experience although being a highbudget movie it still retained that subtle qt ironic and highly entertaining dialogue as they say two thumbs up i wish had more thumbs thoughvote 9810      02 deducted for using dont let be misunderstood in the soundtrack  i hate cheesy latin songs sorry,cruel
a deliciously violent movie which tarantino had to do in his uniquely animated way which people would enjoy long after  a revolutionary entertaining form of art since tom  jerryuma thurman had never got better parts since pulp fiction her yellow jumpsuit image is as haunting as bruce lees  a much bigger impact than the dollops of crimson ketchup,cruel
it is not easy to interpret my summary and i actually have the same feeling after watching vol 1i had very big expectations to this new tarantino movie i had hoped it would be just as good as pulp fiction it was maybe a bit much to expect but you should not expect less from such a talented directorthe actors chosen for this movie are chosen wisely i really like uma thurman she has it as bobby bowfinger calls it it is hard to describe what it is but it us a combination of personality and talent the rest of the cast was also good but uma thurman is especially a fantastic experiencethe action is good too but it is actually a problem tarantino seems to be obsessed with impressive fight scenes so he forgets to get flow in the story at the same time i must admit that i am not a fan of the fight scenes used in matrix and crouching tiger hidden dragon i prefer fight style ala indiana jones with fists it is much more cool it is maybe not as artistic but it is how fight scenes should beanother tarantino obsession is blood and i actually like the use of blood as in pulp fiction or the verhoeven style but the use of blood in this movie was more like the monty python style and it does not work in the long run in this movie i could laugh a few times because of the extreme use of blood but it could not keep the comical element for all 111 minutesas you can read from my review i was not as pleased as i had hoped the movie was without doubt beautifully made but the plot was maybe a bit too thin and the story moved too slowly despite all this the movie deserves 710 but do not expect this to be a classic like pulp fiction,cruel
i always somewhat enjoyed some of the old japanese sword fighting kung fu type movies even though most of the time i never understood what they were saying thank god for subtitles quentin tarintino hasnt done anything to impress me since pulp fiction this movie brings that element back of when everyone knew it was a movie out of the ordinary had real memorable lines no matter how great or obscene they were and always made you want to watch it over and over again because there was something you always wanted to catch again and again to see how you interpret it at points it felt like a real challenging video game which is what i really enjoyed about it if you can get past the mega violence factor then this movie would be as enjoyable as the good the bag and the ugly as clint eastwoods character the man with no name where as uma thurmans character can be regarded as the same yes revenge can be cold but for those who feel it hard enough you will avenge with no other goal in mind like a warriorall of the fight scenes were done well best one was between the bride and go go yubarki and the scenes were shot very well has a great look to it and a rough but slick feel to it at the same timegreat movie quentin kept it straight to the point not complicated at all looking forward to volume 2 uma thurman will ,cruel
i did not find the violence cartoonish even the cartoons i wish the creative talent had been used differently  i felt uncomfortable with the blood and gore sure blood is red and snow is white and an artistic beautiful creation can come from marrying the two but whyuma may be beautiful but her toes are ugly they should have used a stand in for the feet  someone with attractive ones,cruel
volume 1 2003 uma thurman david carradine lucy liu daryl hannah vivica a fox michael madsen michael parks sonny chiba chiaki kuriyama julie dreyfuss d quentin tarantino frenetic witty ultraviolent action yarn about a retired assassin waking up from a fouryear coma and settling the score on her fellow assassins and onetime boss bill who gunned her down on her wedding day and left for dead the extreme kinetic violence including mutilation of limbs and blood spurts make up for its beginning episodic lulls and the fight scenes are masterfully choreographed and tantalizing which makes it even harder to catch your breath tarantino celebrates his love for films with comicbook animation black and white imagery and pop music written by tarantino followed by volume 2 running time 93 minutes and rated r for strong violence language and sexual content ,cruel
first of all did you feel uncomfortable during or after this film and were not entirely sure why  lets see if i can helpi have to say that i havent been as close to walking out on a film since my one and only actual midfilm departure during joel shumachers 8mm  the exact point was just after our heroine has stabbed a mother to death in front of her poor child  its not the act of putting that on film that riles me as much as how qt deals with it  having uma thurmans makeuped face twist round and sexily stuff some heinous twaddly retort in my face about the woman having it coming to her just rips the will to live in this world right out of my little humanistic heart having lost a mother as a child myself i would never dream of cartooning this moment of trauma of utter nightmare in such a frivolous manner  it is symptomatic of a large moral blindspot that continues to plague the more mainstream bigger budget kill fests of late  this film is simply a flick made by a guy who has not just seen a lot of kung fu films but adores and respects them far too muchwith regards to all the other violence in the film i accept that this film was to all intents and purposes a cartoon  its respect for life was cartoonish  so why the issue  because this was shot on film and was presented as a live action feature  this makes me uncomfortable as the medium of film is intrinsically realistic  films photographicness lends a realism that makes us suture into events as though they were real  what do i say to people who say chill out man its only a film   well you can bet that there is a small percentage of people out there that dont have the mental capacity to understand the complexities of what they are witnessing when they witness a filmic massacre to them and perhaps underneath to a larger majority the film panders to the same base human desires that make people want to distribute sick photos of deformities and accidents and the like over the internet or slow down to gaze at a fresh car crash  its an ugly unconstructive human traitbut it is not the violence itself that i object to as i hinted at above its the handling of the violence the treatment of human tragedy  this film as well as many others has a complete and utter disrespect for it  most mainstream films are simply representations of life and amongst those representations ideas are formed and tossed out for the audience to catch  having a film full of throw away tragedy is consistently tossing ignorant ideas at an audience to the point where you become desensitised  its this and the context that makes the violence palatable  if the scene i described above happened at the end of a ken loach film it would be highly disturbing because instead of being surrounded by drivel the event would be surrounded by events and ideas that give life the respect it deservesmicheal hanekes funny games is a worthy antidote to this rubbish  the cheapening of life in films has to stop,cruel
in the world of film a lot of things can happen in six years to some directors six years is a mere blink of an eye such as stanley kubrick others like the coen brothers would have to fill that period with as much great work as possible in both filmmakers cases you always knew you would be rewarded with a great piece of work and also in both cases the strength of their established material was so great that they were never afraid of disappearing from the public eyeduring the past six years my heart and mind has been caressed and challenged by such new talents as pt anderson and christopher nolan with masterpieces like magnolia and memento and during that hiatus my mind forgot about the fact that reservoir dogs focused my direction toward quality films the amount of dialogue from pulp fiction that is now part of my daily vocabulary and the laid back chilled out approach tarantino took with jackie brown my mind tends to forget what is good for it and so we come to opens with a bang and ends with a question both of them are unexpected and both of them hit you hard and leave you reeling inbetween those events uma thurman as the woman with no name yet starts out on her path of bloody retribution thats all you need to know going into this film that and the fact that there may be spoilers aheadive heard a lot of people whove seen this film complaining about either the lack of plot the lack of typical tarantino dialogue or the levels of violence well to all you who complain of such matters you dont deserve this film go bury your head in the sand and wait for something formulaic to appear in terms of plot progression no nothing much actually happens in the first volume the bride wakes up four years after being shot into a coma on her wedding day orders some japanese steel and takes out two of the people on her death list number 5 but so what if thats all that happens is it essential for every great film to have a complex and detailed story no absolutely not in the straight story all that happens is an old man travels across the country to visit his estranged brother but its the richness of the way the story is told which makes it so captivating and in everything is told with style with regard to the dialogue i think i would have found it offputting if the film had been populated with characters that talked and discussed everyday matters like they do in pulp fiction or reservoir dogs while this film moves incredibly fast the characters dont theyre contemplative and remorseful over their actions both in the past and for whats to come besides which what film law states that tarantino has to fill every film he makes with whats become known as his trademark dialogue ridiculous and there are some great lines in if on your journey you should encounter god god will be cut and i want him to witness the extent of my mercy by witnessing your deformed body great lines and great deliveriesas for the violence yeah theres a lot of it deal with it either watch and enjoy or shield your eyes theres brutal ugly violence and insane cartoon violence and then theres blood soaked anime violence and unseen but horribly implied coma violence limbs go aleaping and bodies are bloodied theres a lot of blood in here think of mr orange as a starting off point and take your imagination from there i like the level of violence in this film its refreshing after so many directors are afraid to show the full extent of damage that could be caused to someone in order that their film will be more accessible to mass audiences i like the fact that the samurai swords in this film dont just kill people but they cleanly slice through flesh and bone and i like the fact that every move every slice every punch and kick really hurtsthis film is set resolutely in the revengeexploitation genre as quentin himself has stated many times and as such the carnage has to be bloodier and more savage than you would find in mainstream movies until now of course as is most definitely mainstream but with an even wider appeal reaching out to those of us who can identify the genres and styles he has successfully blended much like the way pixars films appeal to both children and adults will grab the friday and saturday night audience tempted by the thrill of action but it will also ensnare the serious film head who will appreciate the film on the same but also a deeper level from the wonderfully measured performances the technical aspects that quentin is more in command of as a director such as the camera work and editing the mixing of genres and film styles live action to anime colour to black and white to bluebackdrop shadow outlines back to colour and of course tarantinos latest soundtrack compilationand its here that he excels himself perhaps more than in any other aspect contains my favourite tarantino soundtrack so far and if anything his musical choices actually seem to have improved in the past six years not that there was anything to ever complain about of course but here its just a little deeper the songs and themes seem to resonate more with the action onscreen starting off with perhaps the most ridiculously apt song bang bang my baby shot me down straight after bill slugs a slug into the brides head he then stirs in spaghetti western themed music against oren ishiis animated origin chapter to excellent effect theres a superb touch that happens three times where tarantino takes a short burst of music from ironside and plays it when the bride comes into contact with someone she badly needs to fcuk up and theres a beautiful japanese voiced song that picks up after the bride and oren ishiis fight in a striking snow covered japanese garden the effects and sound design to this film are excellent and a vast improvement over his previous work methinks quentin got into home cinema in a big way during his writing holidaythe fight scenes are expertly choreographed and captured although there are only really two to speak of the initial melee with copperhead in suburbia land and the showdown at house of blue leaves which takes on about four different stages and lasts for something like 20 minutes the domesticated fight is messy and fleeting both women grabbing at whatever they can to gain the upper hand its loud and it hurts but its also prematurely broken up before too much tissue damage stops the funhouse of blue leaves however is a thing of beauty it begins with an arm being hacked off as the bride strides toward oren her bloodied hattori hanzo samurai sword in hand standing in her way is the small matter of orens six initial subordinates her personal guard go go yubari and of course her yakuza army the first six are dispatched with very simply no fuss just slice and dice go go is more of a challenge with her whirling ball of spiky death and more of a challenge to film for this fight the camera moves around more as in the same way that the bride has to ready and better herself for each stage you can see this by the first fight being fairly grounded both the bride the camera and the combatants with go go the fight moves around the floor more and up onto table tops and we get overhead camera moves and more varied shot types with quicker editing cuts by the time she faces orens army everyone is all over the place the bride uses the whole space of the floor under and above through paper walls and up the stairs onto balconies and traversing down bamboo shoots the camera follows in the same fashion and even more rapid cuts are required and the film changes to black and white now this can either be quentins homage to the monochrome samurai films of the 50s or that he didnt feel us audiences would handle the vibrancy of geysers of blood as well as eastern audiences who are getting their own full colour version of the film personally ill be getting dvd versions tailored for each side of the world so it matters not to methe fight and film changes again as the bride and the remaining 8 or so of the crazy 88s head up into a small room where after a lighting change by the owner of the restaurant the principals are cloaked entirely in silhouette framed by a gorgeous blue background once the last suit wearing sword holding member has been spanked and the bride addresses anyone left alive to hear its onto the final part of the climax i dont know where quentins production designer has been or what hes been doing for six years but that japanese snowy garden is one of the most beautiful looking sets ive ever seen on screen and again the film changes design this is a slower and more calculated fight arguably its less climactic than the previous fight but only in strict action terms the exchanges between the bride and oren ishii as minimal as they are provide the whole crux of the film the understated regret and remorse from the main characters of what they have done in their past and what they intend to do in the future should they even get that fartheres so much that i havent touched on as well the little tarantino tricks like mias onscreen square in pulp fiction and his wealth of film references the whole man from okinawa chapter and the greatness of sonny chiba the character actor the performances of darryl hannah and the unseen david carradine as billis a masterpiece and the most exhilarating film ive seen in years its exactly how i would have expected quentin tarantino to bounce back onto the screen yet completely confound my expectations and were only halfway through the story,cruel
the first thing you need to know about is that its about as far removed from tarantinos classic pulp fiction as you can get tarantinos calling card  cool criminal types who kill casually and shoot the breeze about pop culture from this and many other decades  is absent and thank god returning to that formula used to lovely effect in fiction and 1992s reservoir dogs and aped by just about every subsequent crime movie since would have provoked audible winces from audience who have been anxiously awaiting the directors followup to 1997s mildly received jackie brownno mr tarantino has tired of that one trick and as such cant be called a pony hes looking in other directions inhaling every piece of cinematic candy he can find and sifting through it all to find suitable inspiration in this case the inspiration is the classic kungfu chopsockies of the 1970s is littered with sly references to these cult flicks so its safe to say that those cultists will get slightly more out of than the average moviegoer but that doesnt mean the average moviegoer wont have fun with this trash because make no mistake is trash in its purest and most exhilerating form tarantino borrows recycles and improves on old garbage and turns it intowell new garbage the result a cult classic in the making and a breath of muchneeded fresh air in this seasons stale movie environmentthe second thing you need to know about is that the pace never slows down you know youre in for a treat when the first major fight scene takes place less than 5 minutes after the opening credits after that its a highoctane ride as the bride uma thurman tries to track down the btard who crashed her wedding killed everyone in attendance including the groom and her unborn baby and shot her in the head she survived though and newly equipped with a metal plate in her head and one hell of a bad mood the bride is out to see bill is the leader of a topsecret group called the deadly viper assassination squad dvas  theyre divas get it the entire squad along with bill busted up the wedding for an asyetunknown reason hopefully volume 2 will fill that particular hole so the bride decides to kill all of the dvas along with bill in case you couldnt tell by now has cult movie written all over itand what a cult movie tarantino fills with knowing nods to martial arts classics and manages to fuse them with his own poppunk ultraviolent sensibilities the gore in this movie is deliciously overdone  you can practically see the hose spouting blood out of the decapitated yakuzas head and thats to say nothing of the anime section detailing the childhood of one of the dvas oren ishii lucy liu the final climactic fight scene which takes place in a gorgeous tokyo restaurant has more eyepopping choreography and virtuosic camera work than you likely thought possible the whole thing is like crouching tiger on acid with uma and co brazenly flaunting the rules of gravity while showing off some of fight supervisor yuen wopings best work to date dialogue is shamelessly cheesy its characters are cartoons and its all overseen by the faceless bill david carradine from tvs kung fu natch whose weapon of choice is a katana that closely mirrors the one that the bride uses to exact her revenge a retired swordmaker who makes one last blade after swearing hed never make another weapon again cough cough cheese cheese a psedoff bartenders assistant a necrophilic male nurse hes buck and hes here to fck nancy sinatra and el paso all make their way into the mix but whats most interesting about atmosphere is the eastmeetswest sentiment for every slomo katana attack theres a gunshot from a sixshooter for every oriental flute solo theres a harmonica lick for every masked yakuza gangster theres a deputy decked out in a cowboy hat and leather boots its as if tarantino is subliminally trying to get us the west to connect with them the east two cultures legendarily incompatibleas it turns out theyre quite compatible after all as has huge appeal for both hardcore bruce lee fanatics and the average bloodandgutsloving joe schmoe is a bracing thrilling piece of popculture junk that no one over the age of 18 should miss out ongrade b,cruel
boy some people take watching movies so seriously  what do they mean i got up and left after 20 minutes how can you review the movie  this is classic throwback tarantino  there were several spaghetti western oneliners that i liked and the martial arts was great fun  the carnage scene in the restaurant scene was very montypythonesque and most people around me were laughing  this is a movie you go and see to have fun at not to experience some cultural awakeningim ready for vol 2 whats she going to do to bill when she catches up with him,cruel
herein is one of those times when a film simply sucks but you love it anyway  perhaps it is because it has been six years since i have had a taste of tarantino  perhaps its because im a sucker for all the hommage stick  common people bruce lees yellow jump suit  what ever the reason this film entertained me  the hong kong action the western feel the animae all equals one rocking good afternoon in the dark  that aside from a serious critical standpoint this film is his worst from wooden and over used characters like buck to miraculous coma recoveries to silly batmanesq same time same channel endings this film is a huge disappointment from a man who looked like he was getting better with each release if you put your action adventure goggles on this is a winner  if you expect a tarantino film have an extra one at happy hour before buying your ticket,cruel
another entry to the you will either love it or hate it genre personally i liked this overthetop film of a former female assassin seeking revenge on those who tried to put her permanently away  ive laughed at some of these reviews where people are saying how this is the worst film of alltime etc  people please pay attention here  tarantino intentionally made this film exactly how he wanted to  its a tribute to virtually every karate action drama adventure film or tv show he ever liked  yes it does have the feel of a 70s bmovie at times  yes it does not exactly flow in a straightforward fashion as many of these reviewers would apparently like all of their movies to go  and yes some of the actionviolence is extreme and implausible but this is because he wanted it that way  if you have ever seen any of the films referenced in this one click on the movie connections link here on the imdb site for then you might have a different way of looking at this movie  i have seen many of these films and totally love what qt did with this one  i cant wait for vol 2  for the rest of you im sure terminator 4 is just around the corner,cruel
i came out of the theatre hating this movie though i cannot figure out why for its story is actually a very wellmade movie i have to give them that  it is fun to watch a lot of the scenes are visually cool the blood is excessive to the point of stupidity but its just so silly that i was kind of laughing at it  it doesnt have much of a plot but given that im really into brainless action flick thats not the issue eitherin the end after much discussion with my friends i realized i hated it because its a hommage to movies that i grew up watching  im from hk originally being an action flick fan i daresay ive seen most of the moviestv shows that inspired in fact i still watch a lot of the kung fuaction films and tv series and anime these days  a lot of them are very campy but a few are really exceptionalso for many of the things in i can find an example from asian cinema that does it better  for example the blood spurting is quite typical japanese samurai and anime  yet in better done ones it doesnt look stupid  its actually cool  the focus was not the blood but the tension before and after the sword strike the spurting is there just to highlight the deadly elegance of the motion which a lot of times is supposed to be so fast that you cant seeand a lot of the ohsoinnovative camera tricks ive seen before in hk or japanese movies just not together all mashed in one movie  i believe the manga sequence is probably the only portion that i find up to par to the standard of most modern day japanese mangaanimei cannot help but feel that instead of paying respect to the asian films that inspired it was making fun of them by making the scenes look as campy as possible for laughs  in the end just seemed like an americanized asian action flickparody which is not something i would gladly pay 10 to see,cruel
yes yes  theres lots of blood in  that and everyone has 200 lbs of blood pressure under their skin which explodes upon contact but thats the fun part  its the kind of action thats perfect after a stressful weekdespite the campiness the characters have well character theyre engaging and sympathetic  being a martial arts moviegeek i was also happy the movie followed a classic samurai story linei loved the music even if some tunes have drilled themselves into my skull  i found myself whistling them over  over  i gotta buy the dvd,cruel
 volume oneuma thurman teams again with quentin tarentino in this ultra violent tale of revenge and survival thurman plays an assassin that was betrayed on her wedding day by her cohorts who executed the entire wedding party thurman was beaten shot and left for dead she survived and began enacting revenge on each of her former partners  the deadly viper assassins the assassins include vivica fox lucy liu and michael madsen with david carradine showing up to play their boss bill other notable characters in the film include buck a hospital orderly that is welldisgusting and gogo a pubescent female bodyguard dressed like a catholic school girl remember this is a tarentino film a good one tooin the hands of almost anyone else on the planet this would be a run of the mill story with run of the mill action sequences and shoot outs tarentino however turns this story into a homage to samurai assassins 1970s karate movie and  legendary japanese film maker  akiro kurosawa  it was kurosawas the hidden fortress that was the basis for star wars  with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek  tarentino has created another stylish and daring movie that audiences will either love or hate not many people will say oh its ok they will either love it or hate it no room left for waffling tarentino is like that kid you grew up with that was always in fourth gear and over the top now he has a few million dollars to put those thoughts on the big screen again you either love it or hate it two people got up and left the theater  in disgust during one of the fight scenes and others while the majority of the audience including me were laughinggo figureas far as the movie itself goes it is hard to describe the effect of seeing it on the screen its part black and white part animation part subtitled and non apologetic for any of it its loud brash and bold with an a performance by thurman she plays her part with convincing attitude and swagger and doesnt give a hint of vulnerability im not sure if this was done on purpose but the effect is great the long drawn out final sequence  with thurman in a yellow jump suitsound familiar bruce lee fans is worth the price of admission and feels like an entire movie in itself and is artfully disturbing to say the least there are plenty of gross outs in the film and those with weak stomachs might want to stay away as stylish and intentionally corny as some of it is if dismemberment isnt your thing you might get grossed out i have to admit i cant wait to see the next volume due out in february so all the questions that are left at the end can be answered and there are plenty of questions some of which will never be answered like why they beeped out the name of one of the main characters and how each assassin got their nicknameswe can discuss that after you see it it will make better sense thenbottom lineif you like tarentino or want to have fun go see it if  you dont like tarentino and want to have fun anyway check out pirate s of the caribbean with everyone elsekurt,cruel
volume i lives up to or exceeds all the prerelease hype usually when i hear so much about a movie before its released its because its a weak lame movie and the producers know it so they advertise like crazy to try to get people to go that certainly isnt the case here tarantino has done it again i dont know exactly what it is but the older i get i just turned 60 the more i enjoy tarantinos warped and twisted mind i used to think that david lynch and steven king were twisted but they dont hold a candle to quinton tarantino i imagine a lot of viewers would find the overabundance of blood spray to be a turn off but i caught myself laughing several times during the goriest of scenes i think that was because the scenes were so far out and implausible you know they arent real and could never happen that way in real life at least thats how i justify my reactions una and lucy were superb even daryl hannah did a wonderful job in her role she just gets better with age i cant wait for volume ii to hit the screen its definitely on my must see list certainly makes movies like charlies angels look weak and at best very childish and silly,cruel
ive read many comments on this movie and got the chance to watch it the other night i agree with other comments about the movie that the violent scenes were bloody but were done very skillfully and i feel since the two volumes were originally filmed as one movie it will be both of the volumes together that will make this movie tarantinos best since pulp fiction i enjoyed the first movie and thought that tarantino did a great job in pulling off mixing the different genres together and i happened to read a previous comment when the person criticized tarantino for adding a satyrical or comedic effect to his movies if we think real hard as movie fans we can all think of some great genius who was a director that basically made the hidden satire effect famous that man is brian de palma one of the greatest directors of all time so in closing i thought in my humble opinion that this movie was great and when both volumes are put together as one movie it will make tarantinos second best movie behind of course pulp fiction,cruel
if you was a moron you could almost admire itthe fact that what i have seen so far is only half a movie by default makes what im going to say subject to change as soon as the second volume of tarantinos latest hits the screens next february i can safely say now however that until i see the second half it will be quite impossible for me to say whether is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece or a piece of substancedeprived trashreferencing spectacle cinemafirst of all i will say this much i believe that it was a big mistake to cut the movie in half the overtly simple concept just isnt strong enough to carry the weight of 3 hours and i find it highly doubtful that it will be able to draw any but the more hardcore tarantino and movie fans back into the cinema come february due to the simple fact that nothing in particular is happening to the untrained eye if you will allow me the movie isnt much else than blood limbs and finely choreographed kungfu and theres nothing wrong with that as such but if youve seen one scene youve seen them allill be the first to celebrate the bloodgeysers and limbremoving sword play of the work of martial arts choreographer extraordinaire yuen wooping whom youre sure to know in particular from the matrix trilogy and crouching tiger hidden dragon as well as other movies that have made it to the west such as black mask double dragon and fist of legend is just phenomenal and lives up to everything we have come to expect from modern day kungfu action on the big screenbefore i move on to talk about the movie itself i would like to just take out a few lines to sum up my view of tarantino since i think it vitally important that one considers the artist when viewing the art and of the modern day auteurs tarantino in particular is worth a second glance before his movies are delved intowith reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in particular but also to some extend jackie brown huge critical successes and to great lengths also economic successes quentin tarantino was pretty much set for life though reservoir dogs made a splash when it was first released it was not until pulp fiction debuted at cannes that tarantino made his mark critics went berserk the audience frenzied and the money rolled into miramax making miramax cofounder harvey weinstein a happy man who has said miramax is the house that quentin tarantino builtand that is the very reason that tarantino or indeed anyone has been allowed to not only spend some 55 million and 3 hours of screen time on what is essentially a tribute to trash cinema exploitation movies and oriental kungfu tv series from the 70s however its not just the screen time that seems to last a lot longer than it should as was being shot new scenes were being written in daily and what should have been a 2 month stay in china soon doubled and the list of production oddities goes on and onwere i to make a guess i would say that the weinstein influence has affected more than just the bloated production and release making it possible for to receive its rrating something which even to an incarnate ratingopponent such as myself seems absolutely preposterous though it makes for a good case against the mpaa ratings boardtarantino like other successful modern film makers is at heart a massive moviegeek which shows in no small way while it wouldnt have been thought possible is in fact more stuffed with absolutely obscure movie references than any of his previous outings making it a study in the fine line between tipping the hat to a blatant ripoff luckily for tarantino his reputation as a lover of what is i think commonly thought of as trash cinema steps in and saves him from falling into the ripoff category and that probably makes the biggest tribute movie ever released recognizing among a plethora of others such talent as sergio leone kurosawa zhang yimou ang lee and john fordthis also makes me want to visit tarantinos home which has to be the biggest collection of obscure movies ever seen in the history of geekdom and that is kind of coolnow im not going to pronounce myself a lover of grindhouse cinema 70s revenge movies or samurai tales of mostly any kind even though a quick perusal of the various message boards will reveal that there apparently are a great deal of geeks that do pronounce themselves as such i have however seen in my youth a quite wealthy display of ninja movies that was back when ninjas were the coolest thing around and i wanted to see them kick some ass add to that the various grindhousegonecommercial movies of the mid70s that i am sure most of us have at some point digested how they survived the intervening years at my local vhspusher i dont know but i was a bored kid in a lazy town so i ate it up and the inevitable russ meyer flickso while im unable to pronounce myself the knowitall guru of 60s and 70s underground movie making i certainly feel that i know where this movie is coming from and even more so where tarantino is coming from and i think most other people like myself do as well unless you failed to waste your youth on bad movies in which case the finer points of might go over your head which in itself isnt necessarily a bad thingand that the purity of the love that tarantino has for this stuff goes a long way to save both himself and if you saw any other director do a movie like and not have their heart and life buried in the same kind of moviemythology that tarantino wears like a badge wherever he goes it would die a horrible death at the hands of the fans and critics though it can be argued that has already suffered death at the hands of the criticseven so rikke and i both agreed that while we can respect the selfindulgence and obvious egotripping of tarantino the final result suffers from being much too long at least for commercial purposes and in terms of average costumer satisfaction it is obvious that if you are like tarantino and feels like a movie that tarantino tailormade just for you then there is absolutely nothing wrong with the length of it and i can certainly sympathize with that attitude seeing as that is how i feel about the matrix and the lord of the rings some people bitch and whine about their length i just wish they were longer yetand that i think is a good basis of comparison the matrix trilogy both series have been made by bergeeks who have thrown absolutely everything including the kitchen sink into these works of pure adulterated passion they both tribute the movies and cultures that the directors grew up with and they both use yuen wooping as their fight choreographer  and finally and most importantly they have both been created for great sums of money and released as commercial cinema when they in fact only cater to a relatively small audience of people in the knowbut if i were to rate this the first chapter of based on these merits alone i would probably end up somewhere around 65 out of 10 seen from my perspective it is an entertaining movie with a great use of color some cool cinematography fantastic but ultimately nonrevolutionary fighting it is too long too selfindulgent utterly lacking in story and with a main character that i quite frankly find it hard to emphasize withwith the exception of the suburban houseraze and the wedding massacre i found most of the scenes to run way over the time that they could support those two scenes however are worth taking a closer look atthe fight in a suburban living room was by far the best scene in the movie if you ask me not only did it at the time warm up to what seemed like classic tarantino meets kungfu  though it never got there  it also had a ferocity that the rest of the fighting lacked in this scene we have two primal animals just having a go at each other with everything theyve got it leaves scares and it smashes inventory it almost manages to culminate when the bride kills the mother in front of her baby rrating anyone but then just sort of fizzles out from thereas for the wedding which is interspersed throughout the fragmented timeline that is so characteristic of tarantino it certainly pulls all the dramatic weight in the movie granting the bride with any and all audiencesympathy with the exception of the hospital scene i thought it was unfortunate that there wasnt more of the movie that had been given the same dark bleak treatment of that scene unfortunately it seems to pull most of the grit in an otherwise glossy moviebut then again since is a tribute to trash films it can allow itself to be trash without anyone really being able to point fingers at it and that is in itself somewhat brilliant when you think about itanother thing that tarantino up until now has been brilliant at is writing i personally enjoy him much more as a script writer than as a movie maker and story even goes that he became a director so that he could star in his own movies since no one would let him star in theirs and even if you havent seen any of the movies that he himself directed you might still have come across his work in such contemporary classics as true romance and natural born killers both personal favorites of mine and both written before pulp fiction and then of course half of from dusk till dawnthe funny thing is that of all the movies that tarantino has been involved with writing i like the ones that he himself hasnt directed natural born killers being by far my favorite of the bunch which is kind of ironic since tarantino was so against what oliver stone did to his movie that he had himself removed from script credit though he still received story creditregardless of what you may think of natural born killers or whether or not you like tarantinos particular style of writing to begin with i think that it can be said with some certainty that a good deal of the charm and wit that movies like pulp fiction gained from that writing lacks presence in where you have jules and vincent discussing the finer points of a european mcdonalds something which manages to tell us a great deal about their characters has almost nothing of the same sort and that is truly a shameyou do get some of it when the bride goes to fetch her sword from hattori hanzo when he starts bickering with his help but ultimately that seems to lead nowhere and doesnt at least on the surface further the story or the characters in any waywithout having seen volume two i would say that if the point of was to point out the low standards that popular culture has for art in modern western culture and possible in eastern culture as well then it certainly succeeded a visit to the various message boards will show you lots of people shouting to the hills about the wonders of and how it is true artsomehow i dont think that was the point tarantino had in mind however but like so many things that contains it is hard to say whether or not it is meant to have any depth andor seriousness embedded in it the mere fact that the movie and all its pr announces with much fanfare that is the fourth movie by quentin tarantino is in itself a puzzle are we meant to take from that that this movie is a wonder bestowed upon the world or is it merely poking fun at the tarantino imagein the same way that the overt feminism of the movie can be looked on as nothing more than modern day equivalents of what russ meyer did back in the day it can also be interpreted as a feminist statement or at least merely a feminine stone on one hand we have uma thurman being shot from every conceivable angle and with close ups of every conceivable body part including an extreme toe closeup we have blood that makes blatantly sexual allusions and the crazy 88 puffing and moaning after having been exposed to the furious virility of the bride its all overon the other hand we have a woman taking charge avenging the murders of her husband and unborn child she takes the absolutely oneminded revenge that is normally reserved for men and makes it her own instead when the suburban fight is interrupted by vivica foxs child returning home from school there is an unspoken understanding that can only exist between to womenis on the surface a simple revenge movie with a good side and a bad side but further examination reveals that there are in fact many layers to the good and bad sides of the story not only is our heroine a coldblooded killer herself gaining our sympathy only through of the brutalities bestowed on her by her former coworkers  she kills a mother in front of her child in cold blood which leads us back to the opening klingon proverb revenge is a dish best served coldoren ishii gets her own complete anime sequence where she witnesses her family getting brutally murdered and indulging in pedophile sex to gain her vengeance making it two mothers killed in front of their own children  rratingbut isnt your standard runofthemill hollywood summer action blockbuster and it doesnt need to make any excuses for its characters the bride doesnt have to spare her crippled opponents in fact we dont give a s if she does she just wants revenge at all costs all other factors are irrelevantand that is probably both the reason why the movie works and the reason that it doesntbecause in the process of revenging the bride looses any character she shouldve had she is  as are her enemies  defined by the outfit she wears and the weapon she uses and that could work just fine if the movie wasnt 3 hours longconsidering all of the more subtle nuances at least the ones that i currently know of and understand i would probably go as far as to grant the movie a resounding 8 out of 10 but as i said at the very beginning cant really be fully appreciated before the entire thing can be watched from beginning till end and while i have no doubt in my mind that the second half will be just as virtuoso in terms of its mastery of references music style and cool it better be tighter than its predecessorbut should that happen then it could truly be a potential masterpiece the effects of which will be felt in cinema for years to comeand that is about all i have to say for now there are so many things that i failed to cover and it is to tarantinos credit that an entire book could be written about the many subtle details references and echos of its source material i did find the movie to be too long but for the selfindulgent movie it tries to be it is absolutely stunning in its execution,cruel
you can tell when youve just watched a really great film you find yourself replaying whole scenes in your head or sitting at your desk daydreaming about the music or the action or remembering choice moments of dialogue volume 1 is one such film a exhilarating experience from bullet brained beginning to revelatory end itll leave you with baited breath counting down the seconds until volume 2 appears in february ,cruel
possible spoilerswell that remains to be seen however may be quentin tarantinos finest film to date and this is coming from somebody who rates pulp fiction as one of their alltime favourite filmsthe plot is minimal but then it doesnt need to be anything else uma thurmans the bride wakes up after spending over four years in a coma caused by a bullet to the head at her wedding when she wakes she seeks revenge on the people who robbed her of four years of her life and possibly her unborn child this includes cottonmouth lucy liu californian mountain snake daryl hannah copperhead vivica a fox and eventually hence the title of the two filmsbill david carradinemany users and critics have stated that to enjoy the movie a knowledge of martial arts and japanese cinema is mandatory true if you are familliar with these movies you will stand a better chance of understanding all the stylistic and thematic material on display here however i have very little knowledge of the genre tarantino is paying tribute to and i thoroughly enjoyed the first volume of another key element of the film is the violence much has been written about this including the controversial decision in america to grant the film an r rating the violence in is the icing on the cake the fighting takes place in an alternate plain of reality a stylised movie world which knows it is a stylised movie world quentin is constantly toying with the audience experimenting with their preconceptions of where the boundary of reality and fiction lie his deliberately outrageous cartoonish bloodletting is both a tribute to his favourite movies and his little jokehowever the real joy of is in its pure unadulterated entertainment value quentin obliterates the option of boredom through his flawless direction and as previously mentioned wonderfully stylised violence the soundtrack is effortlessly cool and charcteristically offbeat ranging from nancy sinatra to rza the use of different media such as black and white colour and anime make the experience even more complete and memorablehowever when reviewing it is hard to ignore uma thurmans presence her performance treads a fine line between reality and the personification of revenge she epitomises what quentin is trying to achieve in so much as she is sex violence and cool on legs whether this is her greatest performance so far is to be seen volume two needs to come out for me to reach this conclusionbut she is damn fine as black mamba and qt was wise in delaying filming for herits not deep profound or original but volume one will be one of the best things youll see at the movies all year i was thinking while watching this masterpiece that having the amount of fun i was having was almost probably illegal,cruel
i say vol 1 is a success  for what it is anyway  the style and content of this movie will vastly narrow down its viewing audience  obviously it isnt suitable for children and even many who are of eligible age will be turned off by the gore  so we have to wonder why did tarantino make this film  im convinced that he just likes to make movies his way  he takes pride in being unique  indeed his uniqueness has earned him critical praise left and right what i love about this movie is that it shows us once again as we saw in pulp fiction and other qt films how he loves to make us find humor in the fundamentally unfunny  i read a user comment on this site the other day that said violence isnt funny and people getting killed is serious and we shouldnt be laughing at it  and i think thats the point  qt doesnt think killing is funny but he wants to make people laugh when they dont expect to laugh which is why he presents the killing in such a cartoonish way  i read that in the house of blue leaves scene alone the japanese club at the end they used 450 gallons of fake blood  come on thats not realistic  and once youve seen a waterfall of blood spewing from a lopped off appendage a few times  yeah its a little funny theres a scene early in the film where the bride is in the home of one of her former colleagues now enemies conducting a brutal gruesome fight when the womans young child walks in the door from school and the two women try to cover up that theyve been fighting despite the blood all over them and the ransacked house  when that scene happened the theater literally burst with laughter  you see what hes done  its subtly brilliant  hes taken a situation and a moment that in any other context would be horrifying and would cause the theater to collectively gasp  and made it funny  no one can do that like quentin anyway if you have kids dont take them to see this one and if blood makes your stomach turn you might avoid it as well  but if you like quirky unexpected welldirected movies with amazing fight coreography is for youkyle,cruel
over the top and outrageous has always been a characteristic of director quentin tarantino  and in his latest film vol 1 the filmmaker doesnt merely leave this trademark all over the screen but all over the floor and every square inch of the settings  tarantino who is best known for his witty dialogue and pop culture references relies more on the action to do the talking in his latest feature  the directors tribute to the kungfu genre packs a powerful punch that not only leaves audiences with their jaws dropping but has them begging for moreon a warm texas afternoon a pregnant young bride known only as black mamba uma thurman is about to leave her old life as a mercenary  the ceremony is cut short when she is brutally beaten by her old cohorts the deadly viper assassination squad vivica a fox darryl hannah lucy liu michael madsen  the bride is left for dead after the final blow delivered by her former boss bill david carradine  alive but in a coma woman awakes four years later from her ordeal  with the memories of her beating replaying in her mind she sets out in search of the squad and vengeancedirector quentin tarantino makes a triumphant return after a sixyear hiatus  in vol 1 tarantino presents his own unique style of martial art filmmaking  a wellknown trademark of tarantinos films is the jump between times in telling the story  the director utilizes this signature with great effect in revealing the past of the bride and the viper squad  a great addition to the story telling is the incorporation of japanese anime to introduce lucy lius character oren ishii  the transformation from reality to animation gives the audience a break as well so as not to overexpose the physical fighting  the cartoonish action does not by any means take away from the effect of the film  rather it serves as a different vehicle for the fighting and narration  with all the different camera tricks and storytelling techniques fans will appreciate how the director never fails to capture a blood spurting chop or action packed sequencetarantino cowrote the screenplay with lead actress uma thurman  their combined talents deliver a smart and hardhitting film from start to finish the first volume is built on heart pumping fight scenes  each fight not only knocks moviegoers back into their seats but will also stun them with the aftermath effects  the writing duo not only pens the fight scenes that are true to form of the kungfu genre but the dialogue as well  but that is not to say that the film lacks punchy dialogue that fans have come to enjoy from tarantinos scripts  one such example fans will undoubtedly appreciate is the comedic discussion between the sushi chef guest star sonny chiba and his partner as they discuss who is in fact in charge of the restaurantactors rarely put on a bad performance in tarantino movies  many seem to connect with the directors vision of the character and play it to a t vol 1 follows in this great tradition  uma thurman is absolutely terrific as black mambathe bride  she plays the character with such great emotion that audiences feel her fear her sadness and her thirst for revenge  even more impressive is the extensive amount of work and training that went into for the role  thurman executes each fight with mastery that rivals many of todays action films  her technique and skill would make one believe that she had been studying martial arts and sword fighting for years  equally talented in her role is lucy liu as oren ishii aka cottenmouth  liu emits an aura of fear and sympathy  her portrayal is so well done that audiences will sympathize with ishiis traumatic childhood one moment and just as quickly become enthralled with her ruthless tactics liu is also very experienced with the sword but it is her acting ability that will grab audiences and make them cringe should they meet such a character  although playing the title character david carradine does not make a facial onscreen appearance  however his presence is felt  with a sly evilness in his voice carradine provides a truly sadistic villain even without seeing him audiences can still picture the sadistic persona who would beat a pregnant woman unconscious and unleash a merciless horde of assassinsalthough vol 1 is not for the weak of heart it is still an excellent piece of filmmaking  all the right tools are involved superb acting brilliant directing and an expertly crafted soundtrack  fans will leave the theatre with their hearts racing and a longing for the immediate release of vol 2  tarantinos contribution to his beloved kungfu genre will surely be remembered for years to comegrade a,cruel
this must be the most crappy movie i have ever seen the director is probably a violence maniac showing violence for no higher reasons should be censored without questioning tragic heroes killing each other isnt a worthy plot for any movie,cruel
has received more than its fair share of publicity in recent months and as a big fan of his previous directions pulp fiction being one of my favourite films of all time i was very exited about this filmuma thurman plays the bride a former hit woman who was double crossed and left for dead by her fellow killers copperhead liu cottonmouth fox sidewinder madson california mountain snake hannah and their boss billright from the outset you know you are in tarantino country with the different styles of camera work drifting from colour to black and white even sepia and back to colour an animated sequence which works surprisingly well a nonlinear story to the memorable characters and tarrantinos unique quirkiness the pace is a bit on and off however i suspect this is designed to give the audience a breather between the fast and in some cases unrelenting action scenes dont blink during the final half hour where the fight scenes rival if not better the matrix without using so many special effectstarantino has obviously had a lot of fun with this film letting his imagination flow drawing heavily and unashamedly on his influences as good as it is this is no pulp fiction and there are some points in the film where tarantinos over enthusiasm gets the better of him however this does not take anything away from the end result what lacks in dialogue and memorable oneliners it makes up for with visual style and wonderfull dark humour never trying to take itself too seriously and proving to be a triumph of style over substancenot surprisingly has been criticised for its violence however this is mostly cartoon like over the top and too tongue in cheek to be really offensive althought the usual hardliners will always fins something to moan about  you know who you are with that in mind this is definitely adult material and not for the faint of hearti wholeheartedly support tarantinos decision to present the movie in two volumes as it would simply be too much to take in and appreciate all in one sittingdid not disappoint me instead for the first time this year i left the cinema buzzing with excitement at what i had just seen love him or loathe him quentin tarantino has produced what i consider this to be the best film of 2003 and what is sure to be another cult hit i cant wait to see vol 2 when it hits cinemas next year,cruel
bloody but beautiful  uma is fabulous and quentin does it again  and lets not forget lucy liu as the yakuza queen  this movie is woven like a rich tapestry  it shimmers and changes with each new view  i cant wait for part 2,cruel
i would like to respond to the criticism of this movie as too violent and bloody first i should say that i am not a fan of gratuitous movie violence it disgusts me i couldnt even finish watching resevior dogs however i loved the violence in this movie is not meant to be taken seriously its not supposed to represent what would actually happen to a person who was decapitated as quentin said in an interview i think it was on the view human beings dont have garden hoses for veins the human body does not contain as much blood as was portrayed in this movie the entire movie is unrealistic and thats why the blood had to be over the top i havent seen any of the kung fu movies this is modeled after but im sure they dont attempt to portray reality in reality if you stuck a sword through someones stomach yeah thered be lots of spurting blood from arteries at first but it would eventualy come out more slowly and there would probably be guts all over the place if quentin had showed that it would be even more gory because it would be a realistic portrayal of someone dying this way its just so ridiculous you cant possibly take it seriously,cruel
tarantinos bloody valentineclap your hands stomp your feet and wiggle your toes     5 out of 5volume 1directed by quentin tarantino 2003hits the ground running with an uncanny grasp of film lore and a boyscouts shameless innocence quentin tarantino carves up a bloodied slice of geek mania in the finest of martial arts traditions  as masturbatory as it is exploitive and rewardingtheres a popular saying about tarantino that he didnt go to film school he went to films underlines this with a big fat marker in screaming pinkit is crafted with both a burning passion and a delicate sense of detail amidst a grounded understanding of the history and style of its many scattershot origins be it hollywood spaghetti westerns che chang the shaw brothers a cult benchmark like blade runner yes thats the la tunnel doubling for tokyo or popculture 60s tvschlock like the green hornet music and kato mask and star trek how about that pompous opening quote tarantino is throwing everything and the kitchen sink in the same cooker and it smells delicious tastes even betteris it a tribute or a parody then neither its a celebrationthe plot is deceptively simple a woman known as the bride uma thurman seeks revenge on a team of assassins the deadly viper assassination squad or divas led by a man named bill who massacred her wedding party including the brides unborn child and left a bullet in her brain as if that wasnt enough miramax decided to cut the movie 180 minutes into two separate parts whatever stand tarantino made on this issue doesnt matter because volume 1 works effortlessly in its current running time even though we dont get to see that much of headhoncho bill portrayed by sleaze icon david carradine  remember how bad this man was at kungfu or the whistling hipswinging oneeyed darryl hannah instead we get an agile thurman carving her way through opponent after opponent leaving wounds and body parts that erupt like scarlet geysersas with his other films tarantino ignores chronological order and goes about his story in a mishmash of information yes this is the style we are accustomed to with him but it never felt as right as it does here this is the cartoon and anime style of interwoven storytelling where characters are rooted by their past experiences and charged by emotions of revenge while defined by their weapons of choice andor colorful namesit turns out no one does it better and tarantino naturally also knows where the line is drawn  hes a phd in congenial geekdom laws  so theres no plastered speech bubbles of oomph and kaboom and no awkward special effects just for show he might tease us with bleeping out a name go manga anime for an otherwise too offending scene or suddenly turn black and white as a fingerpointer to tv censorship but its all direct homags that fit as a whole theres an unflagging spirit to as if the tons of soul trivia and history invested in it was meant to bethere are also no digital effects during the fight scenestarantino brought in friend and choreographer yuen wooping best known to the mtvgeneration for his matrix and crouching tiger work yet the elaborate action in is like nothing youve ever seen before its a gorgeous throwback to woopings original style from the 70s  his zui quan drunken master days  which translates to being real stunts by real people and an emphasis on say just how sharp a japanese sword can be cgiless and based on hardcore flow rather than specific stiff kungfu moves see matrix even the rare wirework feels fresh and elegant blended with a keen eye for editing sally menke works miracles takes genre material and elevates it to a whole other level to a whole new world the showdown in the house of blue leaves restaurant between the bride and the yakuza underworld is the most exhilarating wellstaged and intoxicating swordfight ever brought to the big screen doubt me just watch tarantinos smokethurman delivers a remarkable performance as the bride never once do you doubt her moxie or capabilities physically shes completely convincing and not just a silly caucasian girl playing with samurai swords an actual quote from the movie ofcourse evident from the opening highspeed knifefight with vivica fox as killer vixen vernita green to her eyepopping electric boogie twirls on a dancefloor cutting hundreds of yakuzas into bits and pieces literally thurmans martial arts mannerisms are deadon  a performance for the history books white girl yellow heart indeed she truly honors the tracksuit she wearswhile the yakuza showdown packs the most wallop the best scene turns out to be a rather exquisite one the final standoff in volume 1 between the bride and another fasterpussycat assasin oren lucy lui in an idyllic snowcovered garden  is a marvel so whered the snow come from dont ask and dont spoil the moment just acknowledge and respect that tarantino is honoring an ancient japanese tradition with the kind of love a mother has for her newborn its an angelic scene enhanced by the loud dead calm that only lazy falling snow produces as the two warrior goddesses reflect in the crisp white landscape the silence is broken momentarily by the caressing clank from a wooden waterpump its pure poetrythe cast is perfect all around tarantino brings out both slapstick and relaxed realism in sonny chiba while he gets the rather obvious oriental fetiches and his own covered with dressing chiaki kuriyama up as a schoolgirl with murderous inclinations her weapon of choice is a steel ball and chain with popout razors what a deliciously funny performance by kuriyama however much is taken from kinji fukasakus battle royale laid aside but its lui that almost upstages our heroine her dotted cheeky smile and twinkle of eye concealing a hidden ruthlessness is the object of much attention by the cameralui is forgiven every bad episode of ally thats about 95 and the shameless charlies angels remakes for her performance as the sexy godmother of the yakuza i am reminded of john fords famous statement  when an assistent director questioned a shot he was making of a characters face stating it was boring  that what is more exciting than the human face lui articulates a delicate cuteness and bruteness through the most subtle of facial expressions and as she fronts the yakuza entourage arriving at the restaurant enhanced by the terrific main theme its as classic and cool as cinema can possibly getthe mastermind behind the wutang clan rza has scored together with tarantino and given it a pounding pulse to match the storm of visuals that come in from all sides of the universe the overall sound is hard to define imagine oldschool nancy sinatra bang bang mixed with the savvy groove of hoteis battle without honor or humanity on top of the theme from ironside by quincy jones and youll have some idea oh wait those songs are already in the movie well there you goit has to be said is extremely gory the violence is ludicrous sometimes hilarious but it actually walks a fine line between simply bringing bloodsplattering anime to life and the repulsive horror of michael madsens earcutting moment in reservoir dogs one minute gets down dirty and dangerous for fun or shock and in the next tarantino brings everything to a screeching halt  as when the bride and vernita simultaniously hide their knifes away welcoming reality walking in the door in the shape of vernitas kid coming home from school you just might be able to sense tarantino laughing contently in the background hes toying with us but its as thrilling for us as it is for himis glorius pulp fiction a trancelike celebration of the pulp in the fiction a martial arts benchmark and a slobbering bloody valentines kiss from tarantino to movie geeks all around the world right smack on the mouthnow thats a first,cruel
unfortunately tarantino did here something worst he saw the fashion and the future of action movies and tried to do here something like that but he didnt manage to do it  every scene from the movie u can see where from the influance came the scenes were like a cheap kongfu movie if you already had taken one of the great martial arts actor eg gordon liu  shaolin master killer then use it to do some good martial art not the poor scenes on the movie if you tarantino saw anime movies ninja scrollspirited away then do some good manga and not the anime in the movie  its kinda disrespectfull to the oriental cinema who did master pieces and this movie looks like a third grade next to them and we hadnt even start to talk about the dialogs and the story which are like b type movies and not from the great maker of pulp fiction sorry to say but a big disappointment,cruel
its definitely true that you can create original beautiful and clever combinations and call them art filmmakers above any other artform seem most comfortable with this sort of cultural crosspollenation and recontextualizing certainly with previous films reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown in an order of sequential creation and declining originality that cannot be called a coincidence qt as a films filmmaker assembled his work from the works of others in a combination of hipness and homage that appeased both cinema fans and your average filmgoer however the slope turned out to be way slippier than anyone would have guessed his latest work fails as a cohesive mixed bag it fails fans of the director and if anything belittles them its among the worst films ive ever seenits true that im not a fan of the kung fusamuraiwhatever genre but i dont have any particular aversion to blood and gore or for that matter maligned characters this is a very polarizing film trash culture masquerading as important american art therefore its only natural the films supporters seek to discredit negative reviews of the film by implying that they dont understand the films inspirations or they they have little propensity for blood therefore arent qualified to accurately judge the film no its not the gore of which ill add ive seen way more horrific examples of in many better films as for ignorance of kung fu cinema negative on that too having a taste for other things doesnt make me unqualified to judge a film when it really needed to stretch out and use the parameters of a genre to create something original not merely rape its cliches quentins main contemporary jim jarmusch has always had to shoulder a kind of responsibility that comes with having your original ideas tactlessly lifted and turned into international blockbusters i was shrugging and mumbling about ghost dog from the second i left the theatre jim jarmusch accomplished alot with that movie he took slices pun intended at the martial arts genre and rewrote it to accomodate an outsider interacting in the traditional kung fusamurai manner with other outsiders while keeping the concepts of duty and honor very intact above all the characters were interesting and likeable and felt like real people is more of a counterfeit from the 70s standard issue shawscope and feature presentation intros on than anything approaching great cinema or even passable filmmakingi didnt even feel like i was watching great cinematography but it certainly didnt get in the way the final fight scene anticlimactic as it was looked very nice in the softly falling snow but as anyone who ever took a 35mm camera to the beach knows its impossible to mess up certain shots in certain settings furthermore in another recent film far less disappointing sofia coppola knew that her movie inabout japan would practically write itself the dialogue from completely unconvincing alist actors was awful and even though most reviews im talking major media have referenced this they usually push it aside to exclaim that well it didnt really matter this was all about the action false if that was truly the case thered be no dialogue hell it got away without having a plot the soundtrack was certainly below tarantinos par the old trick where you play a brutally appropriated yet far from appropriate rock track nobody but me originally by the isley bros here in the human beinz version the lamest lift off the nuggets box set since rushmore contrasting with intense physical violence was clever once 10 years ago in reservoir dogs stuck in the middle with you the gall of quentin to use even other soundtracks truck turner by isaac hayes and then a definite forgery of goblins suspiria score is embarassingno doubt fans of the matrix the films share the same martial arts choreographer and buffy the vampire slayer the film and tv series share the same moronic plotless fightin babes concept will be overjoyed heres an approachable wellknown actors and a wide release yet contrivedly marginal seemingly ultraviolent hipster director rzamixtapefeeling soundtrack film that will stimulate your dumbest internal desire for watching people fight yet make you feel like youre taking in goodhighlearned artculture  its even hard to believe that hardcore kung fu and anime fans arent calling foul at this hopelessly anglosaxon imitation its just a shame that people with any taste whatsoever arent so easily fooled,cruel
first of all how did this film ever make an r rating if your not old enough to drink you shouldnt be allowed to see this film that said this modern western is a great visual treat it has style and then some the only problem is that the violence has little or no impact after a while this film begins to resemble an monty python blood bath sketch after a while you dont care who or what is being slaughtered its still one of the best films ive seen in 2003 tennis anyone,cruel
even though i am a huge movie buff i am not a quentin tarantino fan i didnt enjoy any of his previous three movies and thought they were basically overhyped garbages therefore i was reluctant to watch  volume 1 when i watched the trailer i thought to myself give me a break however after a close friend recommended the movie to me i finally gave in and was quite surprised with what i sawdoesnt seem to contain one original piece of movie making just about everything in the movie is stolen from some obscure movie or television show of the past from the opening credits to uma thurmans yellow jumpsuit however all the pop references of the past are chopped up and brought together in such an unique way that a totally new movie is born even more surprisingly than that is the movie actually works even with all the cheesy gore great sword fights and wittyyetoverthetop dialogsoutside of the characteristic heavy foul language i thoroughly enjoyed the movie i left the cinema thinking to myself in that sense the movie resembles another great tribute of the pop cultural past the surprise cliffhanger cant wait to find out what happens in  volume 2,cruel
what an awful film and tarantino suggests that 12 year olds go tosee it for the gang rape scenes the guy is sick  another example of how some people will do anything for a buck by the way he watchesold roy rogers films so what does that tell you,cruel
this film marks to firsts for me it is the first tarantino film i have seen in a movie theatre and it is the first michael madsen movie i have seen in a theatre i became a fan of both madsen and tarantino after seeing reservoir dogs a year ago so when i knew that there was going to be another collaboration between them i was thrilledand i wasnt dissapointed in tarantino does exactly what he set out to do make a bad 1970s samurai film and it works it can in some ways be considered a spoof there are plenty of laughs along the way and most of the gore is done for laughs it also features tarantinos uncanny ability to find a song that is absolutely appropriate for whats happening or for what just happened on screen in the first scene we are shown from simply a closeup on the brides face bill shoot her in the head there is a blackout and then nancy sinatras bang bang my baby shot me down plays over the opening credits could it be any more perfect i also enjoyed the quiet strains of nobody playing during the climactic fight between the bride and the crazy 88s at the end if you havent seen it youll understand what i mean when you dois not a typical tarantino film it doesnt have the biting dialogue of dogs or fiction but it does have some choice lines and the cinematography is stunningi read the screenplay and some postings so i knew approximately where the move would end and i didnt want it to thats another thing i have to mention the movie is an hour and a half long but it absolutely breezes byoverall i am not disappointed i know that ill will have to pay to see the other half and i dont care its well worth the money i cannot wait until februaryand how could i be a michael madsen fan without mentioning him he is here for about two minutes of screen time and it was a wonderful two minutes i loved the fact that tarantino put him in a black suit i assume to give a little reference his mr blonde character  from reservoir dogs he even has a little animae cartoon in the o renishi segment and a cool line at the end i wait until february when his character of budd becomes more of a prominent character and goes head to head with the bride go mr blondemr tarantino you have done it again and i am proud to have contributed to the box office of your film i already want to see it again and i probably will and ill be waiting in line for volume 2 in february 1010,cruel
i am a huge fan of quentin tarrantino i loved pulp fiction reservoir dogs and even found a place in my heart for his hit and miss jackie brown but vol  1 was a total disappointmentwhere pulp fiction and reservoir dogs never shied away from violence and blood both films contained a hidden cheekiness and clever sense of humour that created a black comedy even when bullets were flyingattempts this but somewhere along the way tarrantino has lost his sense of humourthe violence was over the top and an obvious homage to kung fu killer flicks but this one just missed the mark uma thurmans bride did a terrific job of convincing us that her character could well be a force to be reckoned with but the over the top aspect of the film really negated rather than added to the actual strength of her character making her seem more cartoonish than courageousthe hospital rape aspects were quite disgusting i wonder why every time there is a strong female protagonist in the film she has to be raped at some point clearly tarrantino was trying to shed his mysoginist reputation by having a large female cast here but he has fallen into the same old stereotypes male film makers always make  the women have to be beautiful have to be rapedbeaten or somehow defeated by a male in the story have to lose a child or protect a child to account for their strength and finally have to be ultimately controlled by a male bill in this caseadded to this was the volume 1 aspect the current trend to create serial movies is annoying at best but when a movie such as this one wastes so much time having fight scenes rather than moving the narrative along it really becomes frustrating vol 1 could have been told in an hour and we could have seen the conclusion of the film in one sitting instead a cheap marketing ploy was used and then time filled with senseless violenceits a cheat and despite some memorable scenes and great female performances failed to ultimately impress,cruel
i like hong kong action my favorite is crippled avengers which is to say i have a sense of this world and i like it when the monty python guys make the blood spurt which is also to say that i have a sense of those things but this film is about nothing and contains characters i never cared about even though its central pillars are things i like it felt like oliver stones uturn he was so high when he made that and everyone in the world was calling him a genius so he must have thought that pile of poo was chocolate icecream i feel the same way about this ersatz espresso i tried i really did to like this film the red cross eye patch the spurting blood the goofball music the green hornet masks i got it but it never scratched my surface maybe im too old,cruel
whats the difference between an homage and a ripoff  judging by quentins latest effort not much  the spurting blood was bythebook japanimation and several sceneseffects looked like they were lifted directly from some old kung fu classics splitting a bad guy in half with a single strokebeen watching duel to the death eh quentin  the only distinction between this film and a highlight reel of genuine animekung fu movies is the presence of some recognizable hollywood talent and the absence of an allasian cast anyways do your self a favor and watch some real martial arts movies on cable or rent quentin tarantinos second film instead  of course if youve never seen any kung fu or anime pictures then this may seem new and exciting to you as it did to my datewho was a girl  ha  i raise my snobby movie nerd nose at youbtwhow about that one line summary  pretty clever eh  i should do this for a livingim just kidding of course  im a huge loser  but one thing i knowthis movie blows,cruel
quentin quentin quentinwhat are you doing mananyone whos been a victim of real bloody violence knows that real bloody violence isnt funny in fact its not the least bit funnyi doubt quentin tarantino has ever even been slapped across the face in anger because if hed had i bet hed be a little more invested in the notion that real bloody violence isnt funny and it isnt glamorous and it isnt even all that interesting in and of itselfthats why is so confusing for me all three of his previous films to date have explored the bizarre ironies of real violence the arbitrary and unexpected turns it can take  especially when perpetrated by the slowwitted selfish or overzealous persons who so often find themselves in a position to harm someone cops shoot innocent housewives by accident thugs forget to take their guns into the bathroom with them and women sometimes evince a propensity for coping with violence that belies their appearance violence is not glamorous not at all its frightening and itll most likely be over before you even have a chance to fight backthere were flickers of this kind of theme in the beginning of watching the scene in which two grown women battle with knives in a suburban living room only to pretend they werent when the schoolgirl daughter enters  that was pretty entertaining as was yet another commentary on the appalling matteroffactness with which the lowlife standing next to you in the elevator goes about plying his trade  spoiler  in the present feature a hospital orderly pimps coma victims to truckertypes lowbrow but compelling however these scenes ultimately felt tacked on to a different kind of film and served only to remind us whod made the picture once it devolved into a latter day matrixmeetshongkongmartialartshomagethe heartless filthy gruesomeness of was what really turned my stomach though heads arms and scalps are all glibly hacked off for our entertainment in biologically realistic torrents of jetting blood and guts we get to watch arty anime versions of scenes in which toddlers cower as their parents are chopped to pieces fun but finally just boring how long can anyone be engaged by watching characters get creamed right after we meet them as we meet themand no amount of fancy cinematography and stuntwork is going to compensatetheres a reason those stupid hong kong martial arts movies showed up on channel 44 saturday afternoons when we were 12 quentin they were stupidc minustwo more quick thingshollywood puts too much violence in their movies i know this and i know that indietypes like matt groening and quentin tarantino think theyre lampooning hollywood when they wratchet up the violence to levels of total or neartotal absurdity whether its itchy scalping scratchy or  spoiler  uma scalping lucy i get it ho ho but ive looked into the eyes of the generation pulling up the rear and i can tell you now they dont get it they dont get the joke guys theyre taking you seriously they really are they see us laughing and they think we really think its funny that someone just got disemboweled maybe theyll think its funny to dump us out the 3rd floor window of our retirement homes someday tooand finally i counted two yes two small children in the theatre where i watched this film two small children watched pretty ladies getting their arms chopped off and pregnant brides getting pummeled into submission please join me in suggesting to all parents who bring their small children to films like this one that perhaps they should have their arms chopped offthis movie review by erik gloor,cruel
was it really worth spending 55000000 to make this it seems like an expensive way to show off it made charlies angels 2 look like an intelligently plotted story or is that the point maybe part 2 will be better,cruel
many who have seen it have panned this movie for its overthetop zealousness and its high body count not forgetting the many severed limbs and bloodied body parts along the way coming from me i can only comment that these critics have not seen many films or at least they have not seen the films that qt has seen,cruel
im super glad that i was able to catch this film in japan  after hearing how the american version was different in a few places i was happy gloat in the fact that i got to see at least one scene that didnt make the american cut as far as i have found out the way the movie opened was possibly one of the more distressing things i can think of  if the beginning didnt creep you out a little bit then there is something wrong with you i was already feeling a bit uncomfortable before the first image of the bride even appeared on screenthe main reason why i enjoyed this movie so much is that i too am a pretty big fan of the kind of movies that pays tribute to i found it quite enjoyable to see tarantinos vision of these movies and the simple idea of a movie about revenge made it that much more effective i cant begin to recall how many old kung fu flicks ive seen that had this basic concept at its coreonce again tarantino has managed to pick music that only makes the movie better it may seem odd to some people but i thought that the contrast of the music with the images was just too cool all the actors worked well in their parts but i was particularly taken with sonny chibas character  it was hilarious to hear his english dialogue especially the line my english is very good in his rather thick japanese accent if you are a fan of old kung fu flicks and the like this movie is a must see,cruel
first off let me say that i wasnt too sold on this movie from the previews i was really hoping the that trailers was a huge bad hollywood joke from tarentino cause these scenes from the trailers look like a filme that is featured in a film about hollywood  however i still saw it cause its tarentinoits gots to be good  but i feel after seeing this film that poor qt had seen crouching tiger hidden dragon one too many times and thought i can do that with an anime twist to itand that brings me to the title of this less than glowing review  some of the most popular anime titles akira ghost in the shell are ultra violent blood is spewed like a geyser limbs are cut off and fights are higly choreographed is like a live action anime and the gore is a plenty  i have a feeling that qt was told by miramax to tone it down a bit hense the big fight scene with uma and 80 samuris is in black and white and why this film is in two parts  if it wasnt in two parts this film would have recieved an nc17 and no theatre would show it this is a very violent picture i got turned off by the violence and one of my favorite films is a clockwork orange quinten from a fan please try to make you next films violence toned down to a pulp fiction level,cruel
once again quentin releases a film built to befuddle those who cant quite swallow cinematic violence unless rendered devoid of all possible dramatic power so as not to upset a general audience or disgust someones datefair enough  i remember those screenings of pulp fiction that found people heading for the doors even before uma got a needle in the chest and certainly by the time christopher walken describes in such detail how he protected the sole inheritance of a fellow pow to his only sonyep volume i is not jackie brown pulp fiction or reservoir dogs as it surely was not intended to be  yes quentin is definitely reveling in his opportunity to offer his own unique take on the martial arts revenge films of his youth  did he go overboard losing his way in cinema styles he only thought he could use to tell a storyor as i surmise isnt this film the kind of wild offthewall kind of presentation we should have hoped for from qt by now  the kind that rabid fans of asian action cinema go nuts overkbvi is a big broad blast of a violent comic book  i dont think theres any mistaking that this films ultraviolent visuals can be taken as a statement to all those critics who have taken umbrage with qts violent content til now dubbing artful effectively presented action as too graphic while absolving other films that dull down their content despite often greater body counts and sicker acts  i suppose freddy vs jason finds its audience only because it falls beneath so many critics radarto those expecting or demanding the dialogue driven stories of qts previous films there is some memorable dialogue to be had lucy liu gets the big samuel l style speech of this film but be prepared for a much wilder and violent visual rideto those who get itchy around tarantino and never liked pulp fiction or reservoir dogs i say stay away  if you never appreciated violent films before you will hate this one  perhaps actively  and the world doesnt really need a bunch of disenchanted filmgoers ready to take bloody revenge on qthowever to those who can take this movie for what it is a big broad opera of betrayal violence and revenge or at least half of one i urge you to go and enjoy it on the big screen and then on dvdbut i do wonder  how can you actively hate a film that offers uma thurman in the bruce lee track suit from game of death duelling with an army of catos,cruel
where have the staples of a good movie  a plot characterization or a shadow of written conversation  gone toowhy is it that a movie is a movie based solely on pretty a person flips through the air a sword gleams as it slices in the dark how far a spray of blood gushes from a severed stumpsocalled critics panned a movie like secondhand lions and stumbled over numerous accolades for this piece of oozing filth how can so many critics be so universally wrongterrible piece of drudge dont waste your money,cruel
fine you can see this flick because it was directed by quentin tarantino you can see it because of the hype that typically follows his name you can see it because of your appreciation for swords and martial arts but some of you will see it for the revenge theme that it is i know that everyone on this planet gets screwed at some point in their lives but the hero for this story is a nameless woman who sets out to the one who almost killed her how many women have thought of avenging a wrongdoing in the name of dignity and selfrespect for those of you who have a strong stomache for those of you who get a twinkle in their eye at the thought of combat thisll turn you on i was worried that the public would label this a chick flick but hardly anyone mentioned that phrase at all maybe thats my issue to deal with but im glad this movie is only appreciated for its style and action sequences as i have im seeing this film again i cant wait for it to come out on dvd and i cant wait for kbv2,cruel
having seen vol 1 leaves me with an annoying feeling a feeling i cant get rid of at least not for the next couple of months as it is a feeling of wanting more much more tarentino is back in the game with this monster movie a subtle mixture of classic hongkong style martial arts kick ass movie featuring sonny chiba the grotesque amount of blood to match braindead and last but not least the extremely morbid humor of the master tarantino himself the movie mixes the madness of a clockwork orange with the genius of resevoir dogs and pulp fiction adding a twist of from dusk till dawn in the gory limbcutting scenes seen throughout the movie the master touch is however in my humble oppinion the very subtle and almost disguised morbid humor of tarantino i wont give away all the pearls of the movie here discover them for yourself but just to give an example notice the name of the box of cereals in the beginning of the movie tarantino is back big time,cruel
this is quentins tribute to martial flicks blood and gore done at its very best puts art and linguistics back into movie presentationthe above text is just some comments of mine about overall i enjoyed kb the action wasnt too overthetop as uma thurman the bride dances and parades around the room while coherently slicing her enemies some of her moves even seem to be doable by the average human im not into ruining the movie for those who havent seen it so i will not comment on the plot anyways i encourage those who havent seen it to see it and those who have seen it to see it again its a rewatchable movie that continues to baffle my mind in terms of visual presentation and style to be blunt fcking rocks hard a excuse the language i tried my best to keep it pg13,cruel
qt is a director that is loved for not being mainstream unfortunately by the over generous reviews has received it seems praising anything with qts name on it is now mainstreami didnt read any reviews before seeing the movie i just heard that it was really good instead i sat through a very confused movie qts usual scene shuffling in this movie serves no purpose its not ground breaking anymore its tired the dialog is very lacking in comparison to his other filmsthe movie is your usual qt style movie for the first 13 and then all of a sudden it goes anime i think its too sharp a change in style for the same movie it just doesnt flow very well especially with the excess of blood i found myself thinking please turn off the blood jets or at least make them shorter i have the stomach for gore in fact disturbingly enough i like it but this wasnt gory it was stupid i cant appreciate directing vision that is nothing more than look its blood dont you think its gross way too much of it could have done a lot less and had more impactwith tarantinos movies like rdogs there is an excess of cussing every over word is the fword after a while it becomes obvious that its an attempt at shock value and nothing more but after a few minutes of it you are numb to it suffers the same fate but only with cheesy blood sprayi give it a 65 out of 10 over rated,cruel
in tarantino has ditched the complex plotting and diversecharacters of pulp fiction in favour of production value this is allabout sets costumes choreography music style and gore andfor the large part it works very well uma thurman is excellent asthe bride the soundtrack is a piece of genius in itself and the 110minutes fly by the oceans of blood are ott and this story doesnot require tarantinos traditional backandforth timejumping asit adds little depth but overall this is good stuff,cruel
is undoubtedly the greatest psychedelic yakisoba western kungfu musical shockfest ever made this is in part because it is the only one ever made at times i wished it never had been made you get the feeling somewhere during the film that writerdirector tarantino is like a kid locked in a toys r us overnight there are just too many temptations this film is at times slow actionpacked witty banal humorous sad grotesque and beautiful while the variations in tone waver between the hardcore chops of reservoir dogs and spoofishness that doesnt become tarantinothe violence in the film is outrageous and over the top the clever use of anime is nearly blunted by some inept musical choices in fact musically the entire film plays like something out of ennio morricones nightmares at times the blaring music and rythmic shots play like a music video gone wild i was impressed with the performances the film is almost an ode to uma i can think of worse ways to spend two hours than staring at uma thurmans beautiful and unique face some of the situations uma finds herself in are almost incomprehensibly horrible is like watching the pulp fiction overdose scene for two hoursthe cinematography was almost too polished for the narrative the film looks very good i like the 70ish feature presentation bit at the start of the pictureall in all i couldnt recommend this film to the squeamish but i would hope that a brave viewer would give this unique picture a chance i think it will find its way to the cult section in the video store nearest you in the future,cruel
the fourth film from oddball director quentin tarantino is expectedly violent flashy and totally offthewall thurman is wellcast as a vengeful bride who goes on a deadly mission to wipe out the ruthless gang of assassins who sandbagged her wedding and left her for dead more specifically her focus is on the gangs sinister boss with whom she has a much more personal vendetta tarantinos direction is anything but smoothprobably by intentionbut with eyepopping visuals clever referencesinjokes bold bloody and pumpedup action scenes the film pays off in spades by design this is only one half of the entire picture but in that aspect it certainly works ,cruel
quentin tarantino has done it again bringing something fresh back to the table in a time where action films have been lacking of latebeing now synonymous with his violent spaghettiwesterns with a twist this surely doesnt disappoint while come critics condone his use of violence in his films at times its so over the top it comes off as comical and not to be taken so seriously a light humor that hangs in the background of most of the carnage that happens in his films and id ask for anyone who has not yet gone and seen it on that side of the film to take a look keep an open mind youre sure to be left with something that will be remembered with mixed feelings but a unique flavor that is rare to find in box office blockbustersthe music alone is memorable to say the least quentin tarantinos choice in odd songs adds to the experience we heard the surfy tunes of pulp fiction and in the lead up to seeing it was a big question in my mind to what wed find next cheesy but oh so lovable is what i was left with at the end of the film great soundtrack that ill personally be buying when its out from japanese sounds of old coming through with its haunting strength all the way to stuff wed all thought had been buried back a few decades ago all of it complimented the filmgo and see enjoy another tarantino masterpiece,cruel
after being quite aprehensive about watching and knowing nothing about the movie all i can say is it completely blew my mind away being as i have never really seen any of tarantinos movies i watched with an open mind and no expectations the first few seconds of the movie grabbed my attention and pulled me into his bloodthirsty world that was it bathroom break or not i wasnt going anywhere till it was over brilliant casting and definately uma thurman and lucy liu at their finest im not much of a fan of anime either but the anime which explained the story of oren ishiiliu worked brilliantly well violent bloodthirsty disturbing heart warming amusing at times and outstanding fight scenes make this for me one of the best movies to hit the silver screen in a very long time i never knew it was a 2 part movie so i was very disappointed when it ended and now cant wait for the 2nd episode will definately be buying the dvd when its released and even the soundtrack is excellent altogether its a well earned 1010 from me,cruel
this movie was by far one of the worst films ive ever seen that switching from present to  days to weeks and years was extremely confusing and that whole sex while she was in a coma was demented theres no reason why that should have been in the film the gore was absolutely sickening i wanted to vomit several times watching this film yuck there was nothing masterful about this film its just plain demoralizing when someone gets there head chopped off and a freaking fountain of blood just starts shooting out of the body thats considered entertaining it was just two hours twisted gore that could only give serial killers satisfaction its boils me what this world is coming to and oh yeah that god will get cut out if he stands in the way  crap they better watch what they say everyman will answer for his actions and words i will definitely not see the second volume,cruel
quentin tarantinos back with this high speed action  kung fu  anmie  samurai movie i only watched this one once by now the reason for this is not that its bad just that is not out yet  at least only in lame ass workprint andor telesync  when i watched it in the cinema last weak  october 25th  danish premier  i quickly noticed that this is a very different kind of movie then what we are use to seeing from the king  qt  quentin tarantino  there are a few scene skips  as seen in pulp fiction and resoivoir dogs  the movie is devidet in to chapters like a book and chapter 2 comes before 1 this however i did find a little odd becaurs i was unable to see what the point was other then thats what he always does another thing that i did not like was the fact that the movie was short on qt dialog qt write the most interesting and awsome dialog where ppl  mostly gangsters  are in a verry serious situation and however talking about some silly ass shit like if mr pink sounds like mr shit and so forth this movie however focus more on individuals like a old samurai movie often do or like classic kung fu movies  fist of legend and so forth  this put a side i think this movie is very very very good there are tons of sceenes in it where the hole cinema laugh smile and almost cry at first where a pregnant uma thurman is shot in the head by bill the second she says its your baby the scene is so well made that i and everybody else jumped in there seat from that point the action starts i dont know what i liked best that hospital scene where it she learns that lots of ppl have been having sex with urma while she was in a coma or the house battle where the victoms daught walk in and aventualy see her mother get a large hunting knife in he chest anyway maby a bit to short this movie have only a few scenes in it pretty much devidet by the chapters qt made it follow the story and change the style to fit it luci lu is presented in a 15 minnuts anime clip with as much violence as the rest of the flick i dont wanna give any more away for the ppl who diddent see it yet however if u didden do it now i read in some other reviews that if i liked anime or kung fu this woudt be nothing like that and i must agree its much much better this is what jet les onl kung fu movies woudt have been like if they had had the buget  and the worlds greatest writer  director  this movie is a tribue to kung fu western john woo chineese  japaneese anime i like all hoose generes and therefore i like this movie very very very much,cruel
rating  out of what next for quentin tarantino after crafting two of the most talked about films of the 1990s in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and then trying his luck with an elmore leonard adaptation jackie brown what more can this man prove  well why not move into the martial arts worldhis latest film tries to do just that unfortunately i cant make a final judgement on how successful the whole film is as yet for i am only reviewing part of it by taking what appears to be a linear story dividing it in two and stretching out these two volumes into 1 hr 50 min segments tarantino has regrettably bowed down to the moneygrabbing demands of the distributor although he  and they  claim otherwise its hard to watch this in the cinema without the unease that miramax are ripping filmgoers off a shorter running length with an intermission would have been far more appreciativeputting miramaxs greed aside volume i succeeds  to a certain extent the dialogue and characters that you know tarantino for best take a back seat to the technical side of things but his mark is certainly on the film and as our protagonist uma thurman shows a kind of ruthless glare and authority that i once felt was beyond her reach the film opens with our heroine known as the bride facing up to a member of the deadly viper assassination squad the squad has five members oren ishii aka cottonmouth lucy liu  a charlies angel suddenly gone tough eh vernita green aka copperhead vivica a fox budd aka sidewinder michael madsen elle driver aka california mountain snake daryl hannah and the infamous bill david carradine who we dont even see yet they all thought they had killed her in a wedding massacre  they were wrong she recovers from a coma then she begins her revengehas a very pulp fictionesque chapterlike structure but the similarities end there in some ways this film is a straightforward arty and sometimes overly pretentious hybrid of the matrix and crouching tiger hidden dragon the first hour is really enjoyable the development of orens character with a nice bit of anime to help sets the ball rolling for some very interesting moments however tarantino allows some scenes in the second half of the film to drag on for too long this serves little purpose except giving us the chance to gaze at admittedly beautiful scenery and choreography the latter courtesy of the matrix man yuen wopingcomparisons with the matrix reloaded will be inevitable yet i must admit that at the end of volume i i didnt feel quite as cheated as i did when i first saw the end of reloaded this film does not end so abruptly and we are clearer about the situation theres a nice twist at the end too even if it feels too convenient so its not so much an unclear plot that annoys us as the fact that in a matter of months we will have to part with more money to see how it all turns out for little reasonyou may find another clear similarity with reloaded in the closing battle if you take out the blood and gore the fight would easily fit into place in that film indeed watching the bride survive the hardest of attacks makes you think she may be some kind of superwoman although i wonder if it was such a good idea to use flying effects in the final showdown for they actually look a little outofplace in a battle where most of the fighting is firmly on the groundits good to see tarantino having a go at this sort of film even though if we see many more films like this the genre really will become overexposed nonetheless his fans will be kept more than satisfied and the final twist should help ensure that many will look forward to volume ii,cruel
im a big quentin tarantino fan and knew i had to see this in the theater you do want to see this in the theater the cinematography and soundtrack are killernote  possible spoilers follow so dont read on if you want to judge for yourselfi wasnt exactly disappointed but it wasnt as good as i expected or perhaps it just wasnt as good as i wanted it to be  mostly i thought it looked and sounded awesome but it was a little slow and i thought the ending was somewhat lame  i think it would have been better 30 mins shorter  probably i would appreciate it little more if i had watched more of the films he is trying to emulatetributetopwhatever  i realize that it is only the first of two parts but it just seemed to end abrubtly in the middle of the story leaving me thinking what the feven so there are a lot of incredible visuals and a classic tarantino soundtrack  i just loved the pussy wagon scenes especially uma thurman and the the vivid colors  the anime portion for the background story on the japanesechinese character played by lucy lui was fantistic and i really enjoyed the japanese schoolgirl ninja and the rest of the uma thurman fight against lucy luis thugs  really spectacular to watch,cruel
this movie doesnt have much of a plot or depth of character for that matter its not a story that will inspire a lot conversationwhich left me concentrating on how it was put togetheri had trouble trying to make sense of it and maybe your not meant to first i thought it was some kind of west meets east thing then we had the japanese anime thing and at other times it felt like a wannabe splatter movie and a bad one at that tooin the end i decided it was a 101 ways to portray the same violent scene of revengeful woman kills assassin movie and this movie displays a lot of innovation in achieving that goal where it falls over though is that the violence is as my summary suggests so watered down that if there wasnt so much of it this movie would have got a pg ratingoverall i consider it to be an ok movie but would have preferred a better story cause thats what i go to see movies for not for how great the director was in putting it all together,cruel
is a very good film its well thought out and well directed my only problem with this is the excessive amount of violence dont get me wrong i have no problem with violence its just that there is so much of it unnessecarily in that it detracts from the really well choreographed fight scenes apart from that i have nothing against this films its definitly one worth seeing  unless of course you dont like blood and guts,cruel
this was without doubt one of the worst movies ever the people in it hide their alleged acting abilities so well i cannot call them actors the dialogue sounded like the us english translation of the italian dubbing of a chinese movieit stinksnow i know that qt is supposed to be one of the best i dont care what he has done before or done since hence the comment about the emperors clothes this film should be ignored freddy vs jason and cabin fever are vastly superior in fact at the end of fvj the audience gave a standing ovation in the case of half the audience had leftwild horses will not get me to vol2 and if there is any sense in the world it will never be seeni can only think of one reason to see this as a guide how not to make a movieto me this was self indulgent pap,cruel
when going to see i expected a very good amount of blood i was not let down  the movie immediately starts off with a bang with a wild knife fight between fox and thurman  then as tarantino loves so much to do the movie takes an out of order hour long detour explaining the shtickor plot of the movie  while some of this excursion is a little boring or a little disturbing any points lost are more than made up for in the end  an epic fight sequence stacking thurman up against over 88 bad guysand girls in black in a fight scene in which over 100 gallons of fake blood was used  this fight is in my opinion far and away the best part of the film with such excessive gore that it is funny  while isnt quite as solid as reservoir dogs or pulp fiction as far as plot is concerned you should not leave the theater disappointed,cruel
wonderfully displays the cinematic genius that is tarantino the films extremely vivid cinematography displays bright colors that complement every scene  breaks away from conventional film techniques by throwing cartoon animation black and white footage and multiple closeups and insert shots into the mix  gets the adrenaline pumping throughout your body and has you on the edge of your seat waiting the next confrontation the amount of training that went into to making the fighting scenes look believable is evident in  the actors especially thurman gave great performances that succeed in making a funfilled action packed film although tarantino is known for his immense use of dialogue such as in reservoir dogs he proves that he is equally suited for making action movies as well  also contains fun music and crisp sound quality that only add to making an exciting film  is 110 minutes of sheer exhilaration and leaves audiences craving to see the sequel volume two,cruel
at the very begginning of the movie i was already disturbed by the extreme close up on the battered face of uma thurman who usually looks like a godess among humans  however the impact of her uttering the words bill its your baby followed directly by the bang of the gunshot hitting her in the head made me jump out of my seat  i was shocked to say the least and i knew that i was in for a delicious film to fill my ravenous appetitevol 1 is one of the best movies i have seen in recent years it is a must see for anyone who can stomach it  it is a classic example of quentins staple to take borrowed methods and put a modern twist on them it is a tightly woven revenge story told with many obvious allusions to shaw brothers martialarts films spaghetti westerns and anime and like all other tarantino films has a wonderful throughline explored in extreme depthi can not wait for the story to be finished in volume 2 but i was not dissapointed with the cliff hanger ending  tarantino ended volume 1 exquisitely unlike the ending to the lord of the rings movies and matrix reloadedis extremely violent but the violence is never without purpose in this way i liken it to titus andronicus by the bard for those of you who are not familiar with it which is also a entricate story about revenge that is extraordinarily violent  tarantino fans and indifferent movie fans i think will both enjoy this movie a lot  heck even people who just like a film with grand action and hot babes will like this one,cruel
you are lucky if you can go to the theater watch a movie and come out feeling any kind of emotion at all good movies are hard to find i left feeling disturbingly moved it was definitely not what i expected and i mean that in the best way the acting in this movie was spectacular lucy liu and uma thurman giving particularly good performances not only was the film visually stunning but the story itself keeps your mind interested and constantly at work there is never a dull moment the sequence of the film is abnormal keeping a steady pace it is full of flashbacks and introducing new interesting characters as it progresses this film is a mustsee 1010 and lets not forget that horridly wonderful anime scene,cruel
possible spoilers once upon a time people used to tell stories as a means of human communication  perhaps the highest means is the zenith of the refusal of meaning  its claim is to exist in a realm of its own as pure filmmaking pure cinema which ideologically means pure entertainment all of which makes the film a typical product of capital  let me say a commodity the interesting thing is that the film is not only a blatant commodity in itself one which exists purely as spectacle but it also exhibits some consciousness of itself as a commodity by being about commodities the figures that populate the film are images to be sold each of them both exemplifies and exhibits the most extraordinary fetishism the film is about both the objectification of its characters and their place in a world which privileges objects the climax of this first part has the bride proving the worth of her sword which is a fetishized product a special brand which gives satisfaction in fact the film renders its ostensible premise  revenge  to the status of commodity of fashion accessory and as the old klingon proverb quoted at the films start states  such products are best served cold ie heartless and without any human content like all products the film offers the possibility of gained satisfaction  as does revenge for the bride and the sword she has made which stands for the film itself is proved within the plotline to be satisfactory whether the second part will confirm or challenge the claims of these things to provide satisfaction remains to be see but the movie is nothing more or less than the quintessential commodity of consumerist society also whether it is a zen lesson in commodities or a mere product of the system is something i cant as yet figure out figure out,cruel
i saw this movie as soon as it came out i had been waiting a while for its release it was worth the wait like all of tarentinos work this movie was briliant i loved every aspect of itthe story is good the action was straight out of an old school kung fu flick it was just all in all i think exactly what he was going for a very good depiction of old time genres and as for any harsh comments about this movie whether on this site or in person i have heard one or two of them i would say if you dont understand it qhich any who talks foul about it obviously doesnt dont tell anyone you saw it because who ever you tell that has seen the movie and understood it will think you are a moron so keep bogus comments to yourselves unless you can explain why it wasnt good thanks,cruel
this film is unlike the three previous films by quentin tarantino but it also has the guaranteed tarantino quality label on it there are the familiar tarantinolike dialogues with lots of dirty words of course perfect songs for each scene also a few surprises and of course cool and classy atmosphere the whole timethe first thing that sticks to your eye is the blood the excessive amount of blood and violent images ive seen some gory films before but this one also brought back up the kebab meal i had just before the movie the fight scenes in this movie dont hide any details although they are lightened a bit in different ways for example a long and bloody fight seen is shown in black and white and another part is in animation the whole film is a very interesting mix of styles there is a constant japanese feel in the movie much because of the martial arts theme but at the same time there is also a touch of spaghetti western the music in the duel scenes could be straight from the good the bad and the ugly or some other sergio leone flick even with all the different styles they are matched perfectly togetherwatching this movie i had the same feeling as i had when i saw pulp fiction for the first time like pulp fiction this one was something different from what i had seen before and thats why it was a pleasure to watch it i had no idea what i would see in the upcoming scenes and thats a nice feeling nowadays the cast was good although only a part of it is seen in the volume 1 uma thurman does her job well in her second tarantinofilm and lucy liu was nice in her role of a different kind of angel the idea of a dark counterpart of charlies angels popped in to my mind a few times during the film the deadly viper assassination squad just say bills angels mostly consisting of women with ultimate skills in weapons and martial arts and lucy liu as one of them do i need to say more well i have to say that this is a much better movie than the two new charlies angels films togethervol 1 is a very good movie i cant say how good it is in a tarantinoscale because its not really comparable to the previous ones this is more fantasy than the previous more realistic crime movies but it doesnt make it any worse or better either if you expect to see a good tarantinostyle movie this is definitely it no doubt about it its a shame that was cut in half and is now shown in two volumes its not so long that it wouldnt be possible to watch it from the beginning till the end nonstop but this is such a good film that it doesnt hurt so much to pay two ticket fees to see both volumes though i havent seen the second one yet so i cant really say anything about that anyway with uma thurman theres one very good improvement made since pulp fiction she really looks better as a blonde ,cruel
i came across this one day as i was looking around a lot of you are talking about how this film is a ripoff of a bunch of movies this is for youall artists borrow great artists steal quentin tarantino,cruel
after watching this slick plotless film i was wondering and not a big fan of kungfu what other folks in this forum consider a masterpiece you guys who praise this movie whats up  was there a plot i missed newlywed left for dead maybe a baby maybe a father so what alot of blood and a lot of smug actors this aint no hard boiled and leading us on that david carradine is starring in this movie was downright crueli slipped into the rundown after vol 1 was over and i thought the fight squences  especially when the rock kicked the gun clip to slip up seann william scott as he tried to escape the bar were on whole more inventive and fun to watchmasterpiece of violence yeah right chopper and irreversible seem to me much more in the vein of modern day masterpieces of violence,cruel
i find it hard to read the previous comments being an avid fan of kung fu cinema and qt in my opinion this is one of tarantinos best outings to date the action is flawless the references are outstanding and the acting fits and thats the part that bugs me the most  people are harping on this movie because of its onedimensional plotting and acting because its all action and no story have any of you sat down to watch a 70s era kung fu especially gordon liu films i recommend eight diagram pole fighter or master killer these films are all about action telling story through action and constantly skimping on storyplot while we laud qt for his ability to intertwine pop cult references into his movies we criticize it when he takes it to the next leveltarantino in my opinion does an incredible job of questioning the genre hes taken up the use of campy dated effects when it comes to violence allow the viewer to place it in the present the absurdity is impossible to mistake but at the same time it says alot about the current state of cinema the big questions are why is more realistic violence rendered more appropriate today secondly why is it not alright to laugh at tarantinos blood bath yet its okay to stare in quiet horror at movies that portray intimately realistic violence thats a scary divisionis excellent because it is what it is and nothing more,cruel
for more than thirty years all important american films and i include musicals and comedies have been preoccupied with the realistic depiction of the gangster lifestyle and the glorification of greed violence sadism firearms cars dismemberment and disembowelling as modes of selfexpression or a way of life this thirty year period of continuous lowering of moral aesthetic and human standards had to culminate somewhere and it did in the personality of a terminally adolescent movie geek forever fixated on his masturbatory fantasies of celluloid sadomasochism quentin tarantino has misspent his youth cosily sheltered from real life in dank movie houses obsessing over the kind of ultraviolent and ultranerdy cinema cranked out for the planets social rejects and epsilons he is now considered mainstream and the darling of western intellectuals when he crawled back under the rock from whence he first emerged his fans worried when he finally came out bearing a new opus like moses bearing the tablets of the law it was nothing less than the ultimate legal snuff film for the grand theft auto and mtv generation of immature and imperfectlysocialized twits and a triumph with critics and at the boxoffice nobody seems to mind that like all his previous films and scripts his last one is a souldestroying and genealtering abomination not to mention a major rip in the spacetime continuum as long as the teenagers  who are not legally permitted to watch his movies  can get their jollies watching uniformed criminaltype chicks lopping off each others body parts while blood spurts every which way but this is considered ok in polite circles because 1 it is well done 2 it is funny in a kind of mindless slackjawed socially irresponsible way and 3 this type of violence refers to an existing nerdy subgenre of adolescent fantasy kung fu movies triad movies what have you which makes it a bona fide cultural artefact worthy of anthropological study no one seems to mind either that reportedly irony and decadence have been pronounced dead after september 11 2001 nothing hinders arts progress after all tarantino would still be popular  and probably more so  if he admitted to having singlehandedly warped the minds of all of americas youth and his responsibility for societys widespread desensitization to gore murder violence and the suffering of others,cruel
actually i was taken to this movie by my husband not knowing a thing about it  at the end of the movie i was like huh what kind of an ending is that  its then that he informs me duh  this is vol 1 meaning theres a vol2  that was my blonde moment for the daybut anyways about the movie tarantino movies are growing on me  at first viewing i hated pulp fiction but now love it in its own weird way i have a feeling i will be the same with this movie  i thought it was very good and had some awesome elements ex scene changes via chapters anime thrown in  it was a bloody mess with body parts flying but it worked if you like that kind of thingmy only complaint    the second to last fight scene with oh i dont know maybe 150 samurais against our lone heroine was a little ridiculous and drawn out  i thought it was never going to endall in all id recommend it and i will definitely be at vol2 on opening weekend,cruel
after watching this slick plotless film i was wondering and not a big fan of kungfu what other folks in this forum consider a masterpiece you guys who praise this movie whats up  was there a plot i missed newlywed left for dead maybe a baby maybe a father so what alot of blood and a lot of smug actors this aint no hard boiled and leading us on that david carradine is starring in this movie was downright crueli slipped into the rundown after vol 1 was over and i thought the fight squences  especially when the rock kicked the gun clip to slip up seann william scott as he tried to escape the bar were on whole more inventive and fun to watchmasterpiece of violence yeah right chopper and irreversible seem to me much more in the vein of modern day masterpieces of violence,cruel
ill say this about qt  hes one of the most stylish directors to ever work in the movies he approaches things from skewed angles picking up stories in progress and then going back and filling in the blanks his movies are never boring but i do think they suffer from a definite lack of substance i realize substance was one thing kb wasnt really going for but his other films dont have a lot of depth either they come on strong and fascinate but they dont exactly make you think not that every movie has to but i think if qt wants to have a lengthy career he needs to break out of his seventies fixation and show some varietyseventies fixation is what kb is all about from the shaw scope opening to the snapzoom close ups much of is violent colorful fun uma is great in the lead and the supporing characters are cool i have to say that i was disappointed by the final battle though i looked forward to it the whole time and when it finally came it all just seemedaverage theres better swordfighting and wirework in crouching tiger the fight with the gogo girl is unexceptional and the highly touted bloodbath is mostly in black and white this really annoyed me because i know it was just done to get an r rating to me the b  w took most of the fun out of the scene hopefully the dvd will restore itoverall kb was pretty cool and i was ready to watch part 2 when it was over i think now that qt has done his ultimate homage to kung fu films he should tackle another of his passions and do the ultimate comic book movie,cruel
bruce lee said that in enter the dragon the kungfu masterpiece  its good question in that movie and a good one here  qt has made a pretty good homage to the genre he loves so much however the problems that plague many of those movies also occur here namely that no matter how bad a kungfu or sword master one happens to be you cant beat a gun  so why when so many people seem to have their lives on the line does no one pull out their piece when they are obviously overmatched in swordmanship department by the bride  the usual answer to this question is that it is movie but that isnt good enough  sure tarrantino puts some bizzarre and improbable events in his movies but none of them totally defy logic like having one person fight and kill 90 others with nothing but a sword and corpses to be 290 never think about whipping out a nine a capping that ass  this is why kungfu tends not to work outside historical period settings because people dont kill people guns kill people  this is why i have a problem with the showdown at the house of blue leaves 90 vs 1 and none of them not any of the crazy 88 not the insane bodygaurd not even the ultraruthless oren ishii pulls out a gun black mamba is pretty much occupado and open for the shot in the back but no one takes it  are you supposed to suspend disbelief so much as to accept that a group of gangsters was able to take power in the yakuza which is notoriously violent with swords otherwise this was an awesome flick especially the amazing anime sequence which looks like it was done by the cowboy bebop folks the characters are not as deep as in say pulp or dogs but qt is going for straight action here  also he seems to be trying for a semiliterary feel with the chapters and such but again is going for action so he uses pretty a basic plot a characters that more movie archtypes than actual people this isnt the count of monte cristthe book and quentin isnt alexandre dumas  uma was good but the best performances were sonny chiba and lucy liu both of whom were pretty fing amazing  also not as much quotable dialog and the fact that this is half a movie  was qt so anamored with the matrix and lord of the rings shooting multiple movies at once that he decided to cut this in half because length cannot be the issue pulp fiction is two hours forty five minutes long what you think people cant sit in the theater for three hours give them an intermission preferably so they go out and smoke a bowl  finally the music is awesome from the oppening song to another great score by rza another big fan of 70s kungfu here going for more or a 70s funk vibe than the badass beats he used to score ghost dog now if only he could hook up with john carpenter for the next wu tang albumany fool can pull a trigger,cruel
this was a good and exciting movie full of great moments that has a lot going for it the cinematography and score were the best ever but the problems stick out just like one of uma thurmans sore toes stuff like this becomes forgetable and self indulgent to say the least there are valid reasons why i think this ones vastly overrated read on i put a lot of thought into itwarning major spoilers ahead1 reason tarantino is having fun with himself at the expense of his audience the audience i saw it felt cold and indifferent to the character of the bride her logic although justified somehow seemed forced for me the design of the story is the culprit not uma thurmans performance she was great but lacks the screen precense and charisma to truly make her an iconic characterbummer 2 reason could anyone explain how can a skinny white girl survive that beating awaken from a four year comma suddenly remember what happened to her and rehabilitate herself all during the span of one day come on the jokes on us and we bought it this belongs in an 80s action movie and if its intentional then i got lost on that one if its arnold or stallone then we i could beleive that but uma thurmanno way3 reason the handling of the o ren ishi character bar none lucy liu is the best thing about this movie whenever shes onscreen the energy level goes up her story actually made me feel empathy for her character and i thought she was the superior swordswoman vs the bride the bride beat her because of the hanzo steel not the sword skillsbut after such a great set up why did tarantino kill her off like that exposed brains cheapens the character and thats so unsatisfying why didnt he stick to the samurai ethics and have her die a more honorable death is beyond me4 reason there is a fine line between theft and paying homage ive seen everything in this movie done better and more effective in films of directors like suzuki seijun and kinji fukasaku the fact that he copied their superior movies isnt the point its how he used the theft that cheapens it its like he went ballistic and tried to top these masters with his 55 million budget hes all technique and sloppy execution5 and last reason the story i reserve judgement till i see the resolution but i say the story doesnt warrant a three hour movie this is a trend of many directors who have final cut pt anderson comes to mind as a genre movie about revenge it doesnt earn itas a whole this movie could have been a smashing 139 minutes had they cut off vivica foxs character and peripheral stuff and just concentrated on the bill and o ren ishii characters miramax robbed me for paying twice to see one movie once again the jokes on us the audience but like i said i give tarantino benefit of the doubt and juicy stuff might come on volume 2there you have it those are my reasons the movie will make a truckload of money but that wont hide the fact that this movie sucks ill skip vol 2 and rent sword of vengance instead now thats a samurai movie,cruel
can anybody tell me why does the bloodiest fighting scene in this movie was shown in black and white i mean the one on the clubs dancefloor with lots of badguys it made the blood look like water and everybody soaking wet im sure umas bruceleelike costume made them sweat like hell but comon anyway the films great,cruel
as much as i enjoyed his previous films i wouldnt exactly say im a great fan of quentin tarantino after seeing vol 1 i would say hes one of the greatest writers of our timethe plot and story has been detailed elsewhere so i will simply give my impressions of the moviefor starters it has literally been years since i walked out of a cinema smiling gushing and feeling inspired its not an original movie and in many ways the style outweighs the substance but it was so brilliantly executed that you cant help but feel wowed by it the impressive fight scene is very similar to that in matrix reloaded although it actually engages the audience with humour and peril rather than simply trying to dazzle them with special effects like that scene it does go on a bit too long but the duel afterwards makes it worthwhilethe music throughout is perfect the animated portion was stunning and i even found myself lusting after daryl hannah who wouldve thought it was possibleso yeah while i avoid adding to hype to save people being disappointed i really do suggest you see this movie in a cinema if you can,cruel
possibly minor spoilers vol 1 is in the same vein as tarantinos three previous flicks that redefined the term coolness here we have a movie of flawless craftmanship with slick action and blood galore but this movie lacks one important elementa heart it plays like a detached action flick that is far too selfindulgent to really be fettering all characters are so flat and onedimensional that you couldnt care a fig about them black mamba the heroine is almost just as revolting as her enemies on her death list shes driven solely by revenge she doesnt display any kind of humanity whatsoever the viewer is expected to root for her even that aside one may wonder what has come of tarantinos most memorable pieces of dialogue theres hardly anything memorable here what made pulp fiction a classic is the way it redefined a whole movie genre with its selfirony and grotesque plotlines but in vol 1 tarantinos goal was simply to pay tribute to his beloved martial arts movies he grew up with so in the end he simply copied and pasted from other movies making his fourth feature seem like a collection of quotes from other movies giving him the chance to flaunt his movie knowledge but to be fair his version does look a lot more lavish and stylish but where is the plot where are the characters where is the dialogue where is the heart all in all though i still enjoyed myself watching the action  but i cant help but feel a bit let down 610,cruel
i hated this film a guy in the hospital allows people to rape her in a coma wonderful the japanese school girl stabs a guy in the groin for no reason and gallons of blood pour out delightful a cartoon that goes on forever and is ugly and  disgusting great a hundred jokers in masks get various body parts chopped off and rivers of blood flow from their wounds lovely this film is vomit the once great man of pulp fiction ingests thousands of foul and rotten film ideas and vomits them back up onto you covered in blood worms and maggots that is how you will feel when you leave  i dont like feeling vomited on i hated this filmi go to the movies to have a good time to laugh to be thrilled to gasp at creative visual storytelling not to be vomited on i felt gross and it pains me to know that this is the guy who wrote one of the bestscreenplays of all time pulp fiction it seems qt willgo the way of orson wells and its a real shame,cruel
is probably the most outlandishly silly tribute to good old time kung fu movies full of insane amounts of blood no not gory blood silly blood and not too much dialogue its so over the top youll either laugh yourself silly or leave early i stayed and am glad i did though wondering since the japanese version has even more blood throughout where would they put it the only part i wasnt as impressed with was when the direction of the movie got down to the hard plot it seemed to lag in some parts or decide on taking too much of the story in detail but maybe thats just me the silly action sequences and sarcastic wit pop culture references in the background her heartbeat at 69 more than made up for what was lacking i think alot of people were going into this expecting another resevoir dogs or pulp fiction these movies are similar but this is borderline comedy where the other two are overtly sarcastici would have been ready to sit through the other half by the time the movie ended,cruel
along with millions of others i eagerly awaited tarantinos fourth movie he is one of my fave directors and when i finally saw it i wasnt dissappointed but i did realise that this movie does go several way if youre a big tarantino fan ur most likely to enjoy it some didnt like it because they were thinking too much about his past projects like pulp fiction and resevoir dogs this film is not like these i liked this film as it shows a different side and talent to tarantino and shows he can write and direct anything other people didnt like the film because they said it didnt make sense but this is because the film hasnt even finished yet the directing style is definitely there but if youre expecting a story like pulp fiction then you may be disappointed ignore that factor not tarantinos best ill agree but good none the same a definite for my dvd collection 810,cruel
like a dj who samples movies instead of music  this one is way too vanilla ice  of a rip off   sure he added one extra note to the bass line  but its not enough  of an original    for a fan who knows the movies from which he pays homage to  there is a nice feeling of nostalgia  a few winks here and there   but this  effort lacks soul    lets hope that the fifth film by looks forward and not  back,cruel
i am not the average tarantino fan   reservoir dogs was an excellent film exploring alot of realism pulp fiction was just a good film and theres nothing else i can say about that jackie brown i think is tarantinos best work with a killer soundtrack until i saw before entering the cinema to see this latest offering from qt i was expecting an ok film with alot of good action scenes but what i got was something completely different   the opening scene was quite scary and disturbing with the bride just laying there battered and bruised and the second the gun shot to her head goes off everyone just jumped out of their seats including me and from then on in i was expecting something special because the moment nancy sinatra started singing the words to bang bang i was hooked and it didnt stop to the very end  everyone i have spoken to about the movie have mix feelings but i cant get it out of my head   i just saw it as a present day sergio leone western with a hint of the swordsmen   you either hate qt or you love him and after watching this i think he is nothing but of pure genius   i mean he has taken all the great concepts of all his favourite films and put them to together to make one but what is so bad about that   every film maker is inspired by somebody and they take there heroes ideas and put them into there own films like martin scorsese leone and even spielberg does leave you annoyed in a way because like matrix reloaded it leaves you wanting more and feeling angry you have to wait 56 months to see what happens next but i actually like that because it gives you time to reflect on the the first volume of the film which i have really enjoyed but it is hard to to judge because its not actually a film its the first half of a film but from what i have seen already i shall leave it in my head that what i have seen so far is nothing short of a masterpiece,cruel
if you want blood and violence  and more blood and violence and an extra dollop of blood of violence to go with your healthy portion of blood and violence then volume one is a film you should treat yourself totarantino the self confessed film geek  whos enclyopedic knowledge of cinema is the reason why is such a finely grafted film of pastiche  homage and with a polish of originality to bootthe homage in question is to a library of classic japanese and hong kong films the street fighter series featuring sonny chiba are three  that immediatley spring to mind this is why stands out  in its language  sub texts  imaget and symbolism it is simply not an american film  with several references to buddhist teachings  wise ancient proverbs and the very japanese garden hose style bleeding not to mention oren ishis played by lucy liu  bodyguard gogo could of walked right from the set of battle royal,cruel
just got back from watching this movie and felt compelled to drop a few lines  i thought this was great  tarantino is back with icebox cool ultra slashfest  i wont go into much depth here as others have adequately covered off the key points  but i did want to say 2 things the animekung fuspaghetti eastern pastiche works  this is pure entertainment tarantino style and those picking faults such as the unrealistic way the blood squirts everywhere have fundamentally missed the point  its a film  for me the entire flick was epitomised by one scene in particular turn away now if you think this might spoil it for you  did anyone else grasp that possibly the bloodiest single most action packed fight witnessed on celluloid was conducted on a glass floor of a club with a serene zen garden visible underneath  talk about counterpoint,cruel
i must admit that i had very high expectations on this movie because of his earlier movies i thought tarantinos trademark was great stories and great dialogues like reservoir dogs this was pure action the story was missing it felt like a twelveyearold could have figured out something betterbut it still was entertaining and good filming with the cartoon scenes maybe the vol2 explains this catastrophy rating 610,cruel
the ample fun and excitement provides dont result from the fact that its about anything that its characters have motivations or that its plot makes sense but from the way it takes us deep into movies and in doing so it also takes us deeper into the peculiar movieloving mind of quentin tarantino there are endless references to other movies most of all the shaw brothers and bruce lee and other martial arts extravaganzas and sergio leone perhaps more interestingly since this is the first tarantino effort where he lets himself go again with his own writing after the more disciplined exercise of adapting elmore leonard in jackie brown contains endless references also to tarantinos own more personal movies and particularly to pulp fictionstar is uma thurman who above all is the most delightful fun person in pulp fiction  mia wallace the wife of the awesome crime boss marsellus wallace and vincent vegas john travoltas dangerous dream date dont think for a minute that theres none of mia wallace in the brideblack mamba umas role in when black mamba comes to life and begins the chain of revenges chronicles after being teased by a mosquito into awakening from a fouryear coma she pops up exactly the same way mia did after she got the hypodermic needle of adrenaline to the heart its a direct visual echoof course is a homage to a different kind of pulp and it hasnt got the amusing dialogue pulp fiction has but we can see the same thought processes at work in the way is put together theres a prologue equivalent to the diner holdup scene with honey bunny amanda plummer and pumpkin tim roth that begins pulp fiction which leads into the background of the wedding murder scene with its stylized wild west imagery and sergio leone overtonesfrom then on tarantino thinks in big settingaction blocks 1 the hospital sequence where uma comes to and takes charge of the pussy wagon we saw her using in the prologue 2 the samurai swordsonny chiba okinawa sequence where black mamba gets her magic invincible weapon and finally 3 the long tokyo sequence this is divided into four parts a two background sequences on oren ishiicottonmouth first a one distanced by discrete anime where we witness oren being turned into a killer as a child by being attacked by a pedophile grandparent second b a scene of her with her yakuza subordinates where she beheads one who objects to being led by a woman who isnt even pure japanese this is followed by the two big final sequences of c the interior of the restaurantdisconightclub where umablack mamba confronts orens posse and wipes them out and d the exterior snowy garden where she takes on oren herself and vol 1 comes to a astonishingly peaceful and beautiful endits not only the higgledypiggledy time sequence that has a lot in common with pulp fiction there are more specific echoes besides the awakening of uma the showdown in medias res between uma and vernita greencopperhead vivica a fox which serves as a prologue feels strangely similar to the kahunaburger sequence with travolta and jackson the exploded head in the car and the wolf harvey keitel calmly supervising the tidying up of the bloody vehicle at jimmies tarantinos house in toluca lake in each case its ultraviolence abruptly breaking out in a bland mediocre suburban setting as professional killers take revenge with interruptions for brief spurts of terse dialogue and the blank reaction of copperheads pretty little daughter to the mayhem and her moms extinction reminds one of the small boy in pulp fiction who gets the long narrative from christopher walken about his grandfathers watch kids in tarantinoland are innocent victims and affectless onlookersothers may delight in the faultless choreography of tarantinos martial arts sequences for me the hospital sequence stands out even more brightly here again there are elements that rhyme with pulp fiction because the way umas character brutally punishes the crude orderly whos been renting out her inert body stabbing him and bashing his head repeatedly with the door when he falls and the way she then painstakingly escapes to the pussy wagon and rids her nether limbs of entropy by sheer patient power of thought recalls the patient methodical butch in the prizefight zenmaynard pawnshop sequence retrieving his watch escaping his tormentors freeing marcellus wallace to revenge his sexual assault by getting medieval on the hillbilly perverts ass and then returning to fabienne maria de medeiros on the commandeered chopper his pussy wagonvol 1 is more highly stylized and ritualized homage than tarantino has ever done before its interesting that the greater artistic freedom and budget he has this time has led him in a way to restrict himself morethe movies idiosyncratic plot sequences fit in with tarantinos mentality as described in larissa macfarquhars excellent new yorker magazine article the movie lover october 20 2003 she emphasizes that tarantino has an incestuous familiarity with an almost endless quantity of beloved pulp movies favorite movie sequences exist in the cyberspacelike limbo of tarantinos insatiable visual memory as if he had a head full of videotapes hanging half spent and never needing to be rewound somehow somewhere his plots all mesh but its the furiously engaging set pieces that stand out both in his mind and in the movies he makestarantino is a movie lover and theres no irony in his homages the problem with the irony charge against tarantino macfarquhar says is that pop culture and life are not separable for tarantino therefore any homage to pulp is a homage to movies and a homage to life that granted becomes life affirming  and also artaffirming what is about is an irrelevant question the key to the treasure is the treasure statements to the effect that is smart butthin j hoberman brilliant but containing no story ebert or worse yet decadent and crap denby miss the movies affirmative aspects and try to make it seem cold when its bubbling with enthusiasm and joie de vivre,cruel
a masterful film by tarantino he numbs the audience towards the violence by making it funny and creating some amazingly realistic fight sequences the music is incredible and dubbed in at all the right places there is an amazing animation scene the acting is not incredible but adequate sonny chiba gives the best performance as hattori hanzo i am not a huge fan of massive amounts of violence but stylistically this film is a masterpiece,cruel
it slices it dices it juliennes ron popeils latest kitchen invention no were not talking infomercial here but the 4th film by tyro filmbuffturnedfilmmaker quentin tarantino if the opening line of this review made you chuckle even a little then you are already in the right frame of mind to watch this movie if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then every director from woo to depalma to scorsese leone and at least half the working directors in hong kong will get a major case of swelledhead syndrome watching this movie quentin has begged borrowed and stolen from the best with this and what he has wrought is one of the best examples of liveaction anime ever doneeven with a topnotch short anime feature thrown in that wouldve been powerfully effective all by itselfunless youve been living in a cave outside iran for the past month you already know the basics about the story the bride aka black mamba quentins muse uma thurman was once the lead member of the divas or deadly viper assassination squad once she got preggers though it was all over but the garroting as she decided to retire from the business of butchering settle down and become a nice little housewifeunfortunately her former boss and lover the bill of the title the barely visible but very sinister david carradine doesnt have a very rewarding retirement plan as mamba finds out to her chagrin when bill sends her associates to the wedding rehearsal to give her a real sendoff as in permanentbut this bride takes a lickin and keeps on kickin even after being brutally beaten bludgeoned and even shot in the head by mr bill himself not to mention having her comatose body sold into sexual slavery mamba has the wherewithal to survive for four years after the fact get back on her feet and go after her wouldbe killers one by onevolume one finds her pursuing the first two targets on her death list vernita green vivica a fox who herself has become little miss suzy homemaker and you oughta see the way she has around the kitchen and probably her most formidable opponent the deadly queen of the tokyo underworld oren ishii superbly played of course by charlies angels alum lucy liu and take my word for it shes no angel here what her character is though is the subject of the startlingly good anime portion of the movie a revenge story in itself as brutal and disturbingly beautiful as the one that surrounds itand no as a nowoften run scene from the preview suggeststhe goal of the brides quest is not as easy to achieve as it may sound before the wellearned dessert of orens bloody demise there is still the appetizer an incredible battle with insane schoolgirl and ishiis bodyguardassassin gogo yubari chiaki kuriyama who has a way with a ballandchain that no mere parochial student should and the main course one of the most violent setpieces ever commended to celluloid black mambas epic battle with orens personal army the crazy 88s at which point those not wellversed in anime uncut samurai movies or the skittishly squeamish should leave the theater immediately if anyone was wondering why there were so many audible chuckles during the credits when the words special makeup effects by knb studios flashed across the screen this scene will solve the mystery for youwelcome to fanboy heaven we have always known about quentins love of the art and artifice of grindhouse classics the kungfu action and exploitation films that were the staples of a lot of saturday mornings for redblooded american moviewatching males what makes bill so special is what drives the film so relentlessly tarantinos unbridled and thoroughly unjaded enthusiasm which its beating and yes bleeding heart all the excited longaftermidnight discussions about the fantastical images every fanboy would love to see if they could only make the ultimate movie is exactly what quentin has done and those audience members who just dont get it probably never willwitness all the homages on hand from the themes resurrecting the dusty ghosts of the good the bad and the ugly ironside and the green hornet to direct lifts from tobe hoopers eaten alive brian de palmas dressed to kill and scorseses casino and you couldnt possibly miss the cackles of glee that mustve echoed across the bill set as he directed scenes with yet another legendary childhood idol the toshiro mifune of the ninjitsu grindhouse drama sonny chiba who stars here as the reincarnation of his most beloved character hattori hanzo the man from okinawa and a pivotal part of the brides quest for bad bloodso for those who would whine about the lack of thorough character development and deftly written plot points look elsewhere is more style than substance because thats exactly what its all about personally the intellectual in me who loves rashomon knife in the water the piano and day for night had a really difficult time respecting myself in the morning after seeing thisbut the mr hyde half who loved death machines flying fists of fury enter the dragon and cleopatra jones grinned maniacally back at me from the mirror already capering with glee at the prospect of volume two next on the death list ellie driver darryl hannah the sexy nurse with a bloodcurdling bedside manner budd aka sidewinder reservoir dogs alum michael madsen the only male diva in the group and of course big bill himselfso whether you take that as a recommendation or a warning is completely up to you the effect that seeing this may have will be no different,cruel
you dont need a description of the plot  you dont need to hear about how its been released in two volumes  you could certainly happily no joyfully live the rest of your life without ever hearing vol1 described as a cinematic homage moviemovie or any of the other scripted answers to scripted questions that quentin tarantino has sadly been forced to repeat endlessly  you most definitely are no longer interested in the phallic symbolism of samurai swords or uma thurmans tracksuit  what is it that you really need to know how will it make you feel if youre anything like me from the second you hear the siren wail as the bride looks into vernita greens eyes you will be entranced  your muscles will tense but when you notice you no longer care  any aches and pains will seem mere memories shadows of what they were earlier that day  your eyes leap from one end of the screen to the other the human muscles incapable of keeping up with the speed on screen  you frequently see actions only as consequence you were too busy reeling from the last scene to register umas sword movement when she chopped that writhing body to pieces  unable to keep still you may start tapping a couple of fingers or biting your lip by this time you will be perched on the edge of your cinema seat craning forward to immerse yourself in the house of blue leaves jerking back when gogo descends a staircase swinging a lethal ball and chain  just as you feel you will never leave the cinema when you reach the point that if questioned you would swear allegiance to the bride and follow her trail of revenge blindly till your dying day it ends its not enough you are still tensed like an animal ready to attack people around you start talking and like a sick joke you are hurtled back to the reality of a burgundy plastic seat with a slice in the cushioning i know nothing about all these kungfu films that tarantino has been referencing  i cant even remember the name of the company who made the aforementioned siren sound their trademark a few decades ago  i have never watched a samurai film before but if that was just a homage my god im going to start,cruel
in true quentin tarantino form this film takes you for a ride into uncharted territory twisting and turning down a narrow mountain pass in the dead of night blind folds on at mach i with your hair on firethe gore is disturbingly funny almost of monty python genre several times i laughed out loud during the film while most of the theatre was quite in shock i suppose uma pulled off her part in a most convincing manner you believe she could kill you with the wink of an eye much better than angelina jolie in tomb raider uma was scary and sexy at the same time a must see on the big screen 9 stars,cruel
heres my theory quentin tarantino has run out of people to shock  he used to be able to get a rise out of absolutely everyone whether or not they even saw his films  reservoir dogs was a shock people still quote the aw man i shot marvin in the face line from pulp fiction  but by now its become almost commonplace  people see something completely messed up and while theirinitial reaction is holy crap their next thought it oh well its tarantino its okay it must be art  and if youre a guy making movies largely for the shock value that can probably get tiresomei think that quentin just decided one day for his own amusement to play a huge trick on the american theatregoing public  he was going to make a movie sosadly derivative it couldnt even be called a pastiche so horribly contrived it couldnt even be called camp  there are only so many long moments that youcan watch lucy liu tremble dramatically before youve shifted from art intoparody and its time to get more popcorn  and he was completely conscious of all of this while he was making the movie  he didnt even tell the actors and actresses what he was doing  the joke was on all of us and im sure he waslaughing quietly to himself the entire time  for those of you who have seens1mone this movie was quentin tarantinos i am pigand we are all the saps that made it possible  qt is sitting somewhere in the hollywood hills laughing his fool head off at everyone who fell for his ploy then lighting cigars with hundreddollar bills then laughing some more  and more power to him  he pulled it off i fell for it  the man is a god,cruel
it was very entertaining  it was really a movie movie as tarantino said i think this movie is not an art just an entertainment  it was a revenge movie and she kick their asses back hard  dont think too much just relax and enjoy the show  it is entertaining ,cruel
a bit disappointing after all the hype but this is a wellmade movie nevertheless it deserves a second viewing and perhaps after that my mind will change for the betteri understand that this movie is a tribute to hong kong and japanese martial arts movies throughout the decades and everyone seems to know that tarantino had been a long time asian cinema fan and that is his dream projectwell to be honest the movie come across as a blend of different genre at one side it is an unforgiving and violent japanese crime movie on the other side it is purely tarantinomy only problem after watching the movie was there was simply nothing to talk about the movie came about as a shallow gorefest flick thats about it the soundtrack and setting was not bad though and i did enjoy the verbal jokes with hattori hanzou,cruel
you wait six years for a new quentin tarantino film and what happens two come along but on the strength of volume 1 im really looking forward to the second and maybe some cinemas will show both parts together giving a whole new meaning to the term double bill the whole project is a tongueincheek homage to samurai films kung fu movies and spaghetti westerns that will revive tarantinos cult reputationfrom the throatgrabbing opening to the jawdropping closing along a gravitydefying bloodspurting limbchopping journey of retribution this is classic and unmistakable tarantino down to the use of chapter headings and labelling the nonlinear nature of the narrative the graphic deployment of an anime sequence and the inevitable idiosyncratic choice of music writer and director tarantino was right to wait a year until his preferred star uma thurman was available because this talented  as well as sexy and sassy  woman carries the film as the onetime pregnant bride who becomes a vengeful assassin in a yellow cat suit with a very special swordthe whole thing is something to do with a strange and fearsome group called the deadly viper assassination squad two squad members  vernita green who is actually black vivica a fox and oren ishii who is actually a chineseamerican and not japanese lucy lui  pay the price for messing up the wedding with a veritable orgy of death and dismemberment in between and i dont think that the other squad members including former lover bill will have much of a chance in volume 2 but i want to see how they meet their welldeserved end and hopefully in the process discover where the bride learned her martial arts what exactly was her relationship with bill and why was her wedding day the subject of such savagery,cruel
spoilersso here he is again mr tarantino has released another movie and as with the rest of his works its a gemvolume 1 ill never get used to there being two volumes but then itd be enourmous if not split in two stars uma thurman as the bride who is attacked on her wedding day by bills deadly viper assassination squad and placed in a coma for four years awakening to the realisation that her unborn baby and the entire wedding contingent have all been killed she sets off in an attempt to get revenge on those five people responsiblein this film tarantino pays homage to all those bruce lee types of films which he adores and which the vegas and co from his other films would also adore hence im writing a film my characters from my other films would probably watch at the movies and he does it very well the fighting is almost constant incredibly gory and extreme but cleverly done and without any cgi makes a good change the outfits are stylish and well suited to the film the same going for the stunning soundtrack and the acting is up to the standard requiredto be honest the one flaw with which everyone will pick up on is the relatively little ammount of quality substance regarding dialogue these people would have a fair point as i admit that for the first time tarantino has made a movie which doesnt make you want to quote it every five minutes unlike the royal with cheese from pulp fiction the tipping scene from reservoir dogs and many many others ultimately though that is ok to make quentin tarantino has been incredibly brave and i sincerly hope it pays off for him its a bit of an epic film or at least it will be once both parts are together on one video or dvd but compared with all the other enourmous epics going around at the moment lord of the rings the matrix etc its a pleasant change of pace and its enough to make everyone smile well worth viewing,cruel
if you have not seen go see it now its the most fun ive had in a movie in year i laughed through at least half of the movie when to see again and laughed just a much the characters the style the anima the black  white and blue screen its all 100 magic on a subconscious level you can tell that everyone making this movie had fun and you will too ignore the grippes on the page and treat yourself the one of the most delightfully spellbinding movies to come out is years quentin you pulled it off this ones a keeper,cruel
very cool movie qt does it again in the bloodsoaked tale of revenge i walked out wanting a samurai sword made by sonny chiba naturally ladden with references aplenty it was well worth the wait the violence on display is very much in the style that qt is doing a homage lucas pronounciation of and when i went to see it it ped me off that alot of the audience could only relate to it as parody of that style of movie making and so laughed through alot of the action when this was not in any way a comedy i hope they release the uncut version in the west and freshly amputated headroll on volume two,cruel
vol 1 from the beginning until the end was perfect the presentation of the film in chapter form is ingenious the storyline is intelligent leaving just enough to your to ones imaginationeven the casting was flawless and the directing is breathless this film is about a pregnant lady who gets tortured and left for dead she awakes from her coma four years later with one mission to exact revenge upon her attackers its a simple and justified story but with raw talent of actors and actresses that the parts seemed to be constructed for them the fighting scenes shot partially in black and white had a comic book effect of the injuries caused blood shot out of the wounds instead of splattering and tarantinos signature of sonnie chibas cameo appearance cool all in all i wish i could say something bad about this film unfortunately i am completely biased and cant wait to see vol 29210,cruel
successfully encompassed everything quentin tarantino has become famous for the plot is relatively simple however the intrigue of the film arises from the eccentric characters surreal scenes and chronologically disjointed editing the uniqueness of the action scenes was riviting they featured an excess of blood and gore although bloodshed is typical of tarantinos other films seems to elevate it to a slightly higher level and at times intentionally comedicunrealistic despite being an exteremely shallow film it is also quite fun and entertaining once again quentin tarantino leaves the audience with a topic of discussion 810,cruel
this movie is all hype  it is so concerned with being cool that it fails to contain anything resembling great cinema  the violence music and editing only function as a continuous distraction  this is qt merely getting off on himself his private little joke  the first two minutes and the trailer are the only pieces of this film that have any feel the rest of the movie fails  even qts trademark flashback technique serves little use  i walked away from this film not caring about any of the characters  if this is the future of cinema we are in sad shape  qt is hitting us on the head throughout this film trying too hard and failing to provide strong characters a strong interesting story or a consistent feel if this was a tv movie by another director it would be panned and i really wanted to like this film,cruel
all pop culture of the last 30 years collides in a carnival of color motion violence and sound in vol 1 perhaps the most unique action film since crouching tiger hidden dragonquentin tarantino once said that pulp fiction was not based on real life but on movies  it was a tribute to the fantastic and the exaggeratedall banter and witticism and sex and drugs and blood  pulp fiction didnt just breathe new life into movies  it brought them back  there is no more apt way to express it than that  it established a new way for film laid a new road between the glitz of bigbudget hollywood and the stodginess of indie cinemaboth of which were choking on their own dullness  it found the synergy between pop and art more than any film of our timecountless filmmakers have followed tarantinos path since but proves emphatically that none can navigate its twists and turns with the aplomb and vitality of the creator  like pulp fiction is an unapologetic tribute to the heightened reality of the screen  tarantino ecstatically glorifies the genre films which make up his inspiration film noir spaghetti western kung fu 60s biker movies even animation  what makes special is that we feel the same ecstasyis arguably the single most violent major motion picture release in american history  the kung fu sequences are breathtaking ballets of dismemberment capturing the voluptuousness of carnage as well as any john woo or sam peckinpah sequencethe soundtrack and score are stunning with wutang clans the rza providing the original music  just as he enhanced the somber ghost dog with gritty tragic rhythms and melodies he embellishes with flamboyant aggressive movie musicthe cinematography and production design are as striking and daring as anything youve seen in recent memory and awards are sure to come in those categoriesbut for all of this i find myself marvelling at just how good the underappreciated story of this film is  like kung fu and spaghetti western films it is a fable of violence and revengerelying on its simplicity for impact  you sort of have to be a fan of these genres to get this but if you do indeed get it this becomes perhaps the most heartfelt of tarantinos tributes  it is a recognition of films as more than entertainment that basic moral themes of truth and justice can run underneath even the glossiest and most appallingly violent exterior,cruel
i felt was a fantastic film that was not only reminiscent of the hong kong filmsbut truly a stimulating visual masterpiecebuti did feel slightly let down by the fact that there were no tarrantinoesque conversations in the filmlike the pulp fiction one between vincent and julesyet im the first one to admit that i came out of the cinema totally mesmerised by the film as a wholeand as suchwill be first in line to see volume 2come febuary910 for me,cruel
i really loved pulp fiction liked the other 2 qt films was very different from any of them i loved how almost animeish it was a cross between something like akira and a cool kung fu movie the cinimatography storyline even the dialogue and soundtrack had a great anime quality i really liked it and cant wait to see vol 2,cruel
hard to review what is essentialy only half a movie since the incomplete storyline is hard to really understand but if you ignore things like logic and character development and just want to enjoy some well choreographed mayhem well this is your movie the action scenes which involve uma thurman slicing and diceing herway thru lucy liu and vivicka a fox among others are top notch not for the squemish as blood and body parts are plentiful here still tarantino here does relish his chance for cinematic bloodshead that rivals any bloodbath films of recent vintage grade b,cruel
this movie was horrible on all levels had this movie been released under any name but tarantinos it would never have made the theaters in fact showtime would have turned it down even qt himself must be laughing at the fools who are actually applauding this dog crap the last time i saw an artist wave his middle finger this blatantly to his fan base was when lou reed released his metal machine music in 1975 looks like qt is seeing just how much he can get away with sort of a test really let me see who is just kissing my rear end and who is really watching i was watching and this thing smelled up the place,cruel
what do you get when you add one part japanese anime one part kung fu revenge movie then mix together with the genius that is tarantino you get volume one some say this movie isnt for everyone yet it is who wouldnt want to see a movie about revenge trust me folks the best part of this movie is that you will agree with the characters motives you wantthe bride to have her revenge you want every last one of those shameful pricks to pay for what they did this movie is driven by its audiences need to see justicetarantino bravely tries to tell a story without even having a story in this film we have straps of a story its as if we all have amnesia along with uma the only thing we can remember throughout this film is that someone has to paythis film has several laugh out loud moments while it never strays from its overall tone is a shot in the arm for a genre that needs more thoughtful pieces like this,cruel
i was truly blown away by this movie quentin tarantino does a great job the writing and directing blending so much things together like comedy animationcatchy musiccool action scenes and alot of gore and violence when i went to see this movie i didnt know what to expect but this movie truly lived up to the hype uma you kicked so much ass in this movie that neo is jealous you deserved an oscar nomination quentin i have to admit you are a fg genius and you deserved a oscar nomination this is probably the movie with the most gore and violence in movie history this movie deserves mega attention in the oscars for every big category including best picture quentin you did the right thing splitting this into two volumes cant wait for february to see volume 2 what else there is to say about this this is truly a must see for any movie lover my grade for the movie1010 rate and a,cruel
honor betrayal and revenge are three traits that are renowned throughout all literature and media but perhaps no culture has so thoroughly examined these issues to the point that rules have been established on all of them as the japanese havethat is perhaps what led avantgarde director quentin tarantino to make a modern day samurai movie with the bushido code of honor still fully intact among todays assassins tarantinos three previous films reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown have all dealt with the three traits but from a decidedly american standpoint add that to the fact that he grew up watching chop sockey flicks during his formative years its little wonder why he would be drawn to make such a filmvol 1 is an unapologetic throwback to the low budget and violent kung fu theater flicks of the late 70s but mixed with all the weird idiosyncrasies weve come to expect from hollywoods favorite indie director the story is told in chapters that are out of order characters have seemingly inappropriate civil conversations during the middle of chaos people are tortured for information and sometimes just for the heck of it and bad guys compete with each other over who is the ultimate villainin this strange world or honor and insanity we meet the bride uma thurman a former member of a hit man team known as deadly viper assassination squad where she went by the code name black mamba the rest of her squad ambushes her and her guests on her wedding day under mysterious pretenses not yet completely known leaving her for dead she miraculously manages to survive the ordeal and four years later awakes from a hospital in el paso hungry for revengeblack mamba soon begins her long journey of hunting down her enemies which include oren cottonmouth ishii lucy liu vernita copperhead green vivica a fox elle california mountain snake driver daryl hannah budd sidewinder michael madsen and of course the mysterious ringleader bill the as of yet unseen david carradine she really only wants these top five figures but is more than willing to put down anyone who stands in her way as wellstrong character development takes a back seat to violence and mayhem which is sort of strange for a tarantino flick the characters are all interesting and unique but this is not meant to be a deeply thought provoking experience this is pure style over substance with characters hacking each other apart with swords knives and other weapons all for the benefit of the audiencethe film succeeds best when it is playing the material straight legendary japanese action star sonny chiba has a small but wonderful role as hattori hanzo a near mythic sword maker who crafts a special blade just for black mambatarantino however cant seem to control himself here there are numerous comic scenes included with little rhyme or reason such as a dirty hospital orderly who pimps out comatose patients to truckers a scene where hanzo keeps yelling at his lazy underling and a lengthy scene in a parking garage where black mamba tries to regain control of her legs after four years of idlenessalso a tenminute ultra violent anim sequence detailing the origin of oren ishii seems added for just the heck of ittarantino definitely has his tongue planted firmly in cheek here especially in the battle sequences victims who are decapitated or lose limbs spray out gallons of blood from their gashes in a disgustingly overthetop fashionnot since the battle between king arthur and the black knight in monty python and the holy grail or the lawnmower finale of dead alive has so much of the red stuff spurted out of open wounds audiences will either react to such scenes by losing their lunch or laughing hystericallyreally the only way to enjoy is if you have a very sick sense of humor and even then its kind of hard to laugh at somebody lying on the ground screaming while blood oozes from a severed arm still tarantino knows who his audience is and anyone who fits that demographic will have a blastthe cliffhanger ending will entice others while leaving other people feeling cheated but then the whole movie is a rather schizophrenic affair on one hand its nice to see a movie where you dont know what will happen next on the other the mixture of slapstick and extremely gory death scenes may be offsetting to most viewersi look forward to the second half of in february though im not honestly sure why tarantino has certainly crafted an original picture here but i doubt many people will think it lives up to the hype as an exercise in extreme violence and revenge the film is a full throttle blast but as the latest film from one of hollywoods most celebrated directors its just a strange detour8 out of 10 stars though at times it is an excessive assault on the senses its unique enough by itself to be visionary,cruel
quentin tarantino is overrated this movie and every movie hes in writes directs whatever is absolute trash this guy needs to go work at 7 eleven where he belongs this is a pointless movie with no respect for anything and i think if youve seen this you know what i mean go see texas chainsaw massacre now that is an underrated movie that deserves more,cruel
before i begin my review let me establish that i havent seen every kungfu movie ever made in fact i havent seen very many at all but i have seen enough to appreciate this films many moments of homage  in all honesty if youve seen 2 good bruce lee films and liked them and you have a sense of humor youll probably love thisi know this is horrible but ive only seen three tarantino films including this one this is the only one ive seen in its entirety and the others from dusk till dawn which i loved and jackie brown which i would have loved if i had seen more of it were on television and heavily censored ive been meaning to get around to to the good uncensored stuff but im a college student without a car and im pooranyway on to the review im not going to say too much about plot because well i want you to go see it p wow this single word serves well in summarizing my reaction  and if thats not sufficient i had to pee very badly the entire time i was watching this and i still enjoyed it  i went to see this with two of my friends one of which had already seen it and and i dont think ive ever looked over to check someone elses reactions as often during a movie except maybe the matrix  after leaving the theater it was our sole topic of conversation for at least 10 straight minutesthis is going to sound terrible clich but from the opening scene until the ending this movie grabs you by the collar and shakes you vigorously  the theater i watched it in had the sound turned up very loud and though it was uncomfortable at times it ultimately served to enhance the experience and now in no particular orderthe sound its great  every movement onscreen is accompanied by fitting satisfying and often hilariously overthetop sound effects  the soundtrack is phenomenal and varied with one intentional exception being the music provided by an inmovie band and it serves the atmosphere wellthe acting superb  everyone involved in this film supplies either convincing enjoyable appropriately overblown performances or gratingly cheesy ones intentionally so and very much in line with the movies that tarantino is paying homage to  uma thurman is excellent as the bride and david carradine is perfectly casted as billthe special effects impressive and howlinducing  im not sure ive ever laughed as much at a film at the right times as i did watching tarantino definitely did the right thing in refusing to use cg or bigbudget special effects this feels very much like a 70s kungfu flick  the animation parts of the movie are inexplicably appropriate and well donethe storyline simultaneously ridiculous parody and heartfelt homage  as insane as the action is and the characters are i still found myself getting engrossed in the story  tarantinos love for the classic movies is palpably evidenti have to admit it i was skeptical about this movie  i have very limited exposure to tarantino films and the man has such a cult following that i went in guarded and with high expectations ready to lose the little faith i had in him  did nothing but confirm that faith tarantino is immensely talented and intelligent  he obviously in the right business and he definitely knows what hes doing  hes definitely on my small list of favoritesone final note this movie is extremely gory  if youre not used to watching that kind of stuff you might be turned off by it but its presented in such a tongueincheek manner that you cant help but laughoverall rating from 1 to 5 an enthusiastic five  go see it,cruel
this movie relies almost exclusively on shock effect and stylized dismembering in order to affect a surreal indulgence in the absurd  the violence doesnt carry the plot and only draws out what otherwise might be an interesting and shorter story  why tarantino takes his directing style to this extreme is beyond me but i know people are going to praise this movie simply for its tastelessness much like the nouveau european chicks sporting mullets  only the ignorant masses cannot appreciate true trash  i suppose that i couldnt possibly understand whats to like in an excrement sandwich either but i feel like i lost 3 hours of my life on this one  what a disappointment  if youre in the mood for something with less blood and gore go see the texas chainsaw massacre,cruel
i had only few expectations about this film and even those werent too positive after first few minutes i knew that this movie was going to be better than i had thought this movie as well as the other tarantino movies has a great soundtrack which supports the atmosphere in the movie despite the great soundtrack this film didnt feel like a real tarantino movie it lacked the feeling tarantino had in his earlier movies in some scenes the camera usage was lazy and uninventive the dialogue in the movie remind me more of the matrix reloaded which i thought was really pretentious than the pulp fiction it seems to me that tarantino has adopted too much from hollywood action movies not much but enough this movie had some great actionscenes and i liked it when the movie bounced between the lines of tastelesness and humourvol1 is going to be very enjoyable to watch if youforget about the fact that its actually a tarantino movie this movie had unique style but lacked the feeling 45 or 6  10,cruel

the beauties of film making and the crafting of cars are fundamentally the same both involve the elaborate composition of many elements and technologies togenerate a single cohesive entity therefore if had four wheels then they must have been assembled by ferrari tarantino is the ferrari of his art and is a master of the combinatorial approach to film direction gelling sight sound energy and tone into a piece of entertainmenttarantino has often stated that he grew up on kungfo movies and this appears to be his homage to them this represents the core premise of the film withconcentrically arranged hierarchies of detail then constructed around it inlesser hands this approach could have led to a disjointed film however theimagination and care that has been injected are highly evident and enjoyable to watch however the plot concerning the path of revenge is relativelyinconsequential and simply represents a platform onto which the action andemotion are built not that this matters since the action is so dazzlinglyspectacular and uma thurmans performance so startlingthe camera viewpoint is used by tarantino as a humour in itself little touches such as the rows of sunglasses on the cops dashboard and the pussy wagonkeychain are evidence of this equally he has become more sophisticated in the utilisation of difference camera techniques connecting them to the rhythm of film the best example of which is the long tracking shot to establish the tokyo club layout followed by an abrupt cut at which point the action beginsfurthermore the use of sound in the film is excellent both with the superbmusical soundtrack and the effects touches such as the increasing beat of the spinning ball and chain weapon  as the battle reached its climax were wellappreciated also the moaning sounds of the injured during thurmans rousing speech were hilariousthis brings me to the violence of the film which was admittedly gory but should be understood in two ways firstly it is a tool used in the establishment of a constant tension throughout the film secondly it has comedic value  watchmonty pythons question for the holy grail for the origin of the spouting blood from severed limbs gag the film is essentially a cartoon a fact accentuated via the anime interlude and is not meant for literal interpretationin conclusion tarantinos skilful combination of the various auditory visual and psychological components within the film makes this his best work yet roll on volume two4 out of 4,cruel
first let me saynot a fan of tarantino in fact kinda the opposite i strongly disliked pulp fiction and when someone starts in quoting the annoying dialogue i just want to shoot them never watched reservoir dogs everything about it just turned me away indifferent toward jackie brown no interestbut there was something about the trailers for  after seeing the movie about a halfhour ago i think it was actually the music i loved this film and not just for the music its not about the plot its about the film a lot of films are just made to tell a story and the story or increasingly the special effects are what makes them great the lord of the rings movies may have goodtogreat actors and expensive special effects but without one of the greatest pieces of english literature driving the story it would be  well those latest two pieces of crap that george lucas squeezed outbut i digress is cinema for cinemas sake its so drenched in not just blood but culture its an homage to so many styles yet also breaks new ground and back to my favorite part the music is just as pastmeetsfuture amazing words cant explain this visualauditory feast because it isnt about words its not about the action scenes either no matter how fun and cool its about film see it with an open mind some people still have them dont theyi still cant believe how much i loved this movie considering how much ive loathed tarantino in general and pulp fiction specifically,cruel
a movie as hyped could only warrant the slightest of negativity especially from someone who appreciated the hype but the only negatives i can come up within 2 days after seeing the film are dominantly related to the crowd i watched the film with yet the reactions of those not in tune are probably the best reactions in years to come those people who saw this film and laughed at the inopportune moments are probably the same people who found reservoir dogs and pulp fiction highly controversial on first viewing and its those people and their realisation that the controversy was unfounded who are the people who make films like these live on past their domestic theatrical shelf lifesome find jackie brown weak but compared to a lot of other films its very strong the filmmakers previous films had so much notoriety that they couldnt be topped within the same measure and qt got an unfair bad rap for it though anyone watching it now past the hype will be able to fully appreciate the fact even after only 4 films tarantino has proved he cant make a bad filmand is like the cherry on top hardly a moment passes in the film when you dont feel this is different yet familiar its tarantino but its something new from him ok not a great deal to achieve after a handful of films but they are such iconic filmsthis is only part 1 just like lotr you cant fully conclude your comments on it but just like said films what you can say is this is a film who has someone behind the camera who isnt just some director for hire but someone who knows how to make movies that stay with usv1 is a classic in the making you may have noticed i didnt actually comment on any of the specifics of the film but thats because its like a concept album you just need to watch it let it soak in and appreciate the complete picture just like any classic filmto even dare comment on vol2 would be completely moronic it may be the worst film ever who knows just let us glaze in the glory that is vol1 for now even the dream of vol2 satisfies me more than many other filmsps requires an understanding of japaneseeastern cinema and if you liked but know nothing of that side of cinema i could do nothin better than recommend you discover it tarantino has made the perfect homage in that its as good if not better than its influencesutterly excellent d,cruel

its been a while since quentin tarantino last directed a movie and volume 1 is a worthy effortmany of the tarantino trademarks remain  nonlinear chapters visceral violence and cool music but where this film differs from his previous films is that the dialogue has been reduced and the stylized operatic violence has taken its place in centre stageas before tarantino seems to specialise in taking trashy exploitation cinema influences and mixing them into a spectacular whole with this film he has done it again by using 70s martial arts movies in particular as his primary source of inspiration the result is mesmerizing at times there is even a japanese anime segment which fits in despite the fact that it should never workthis is another addition to a great catalogue of work by one of the best modern filmmakers,cruel
overis a better title for this film sure there were entertaining sections in this movie but for the most part it was just excessive plus im tired of the timelinejumps how about a tarantino movie thats in chronological order that would be nice the final sequence in the movie is almost worth the money but when you have to sit through the entire movie and then are put facetoface with how abruptly it ends youll feel let down and wont even care about the sequel,cruel

interesting film the characters are first off top notch tarentino always has great characters and this is no exception the weakest character is strangly the main one the bride as she is called she just was very generic revenge seeking character that was well played by uma thurman although the character wasnt well rounded her performance was the story suffers from all most to much bloody action bit thank god it is incredibly well done the anime sequence was simpky exdrodinary the best part of the first half of the film my big problem with this film is the first half isnt nearly as entertaining beautiful or well paced as the second half which kinnda gave the film a off balence feel that all of tarentions films have i have always admired the kind of jerky flow he had but it just didnt seem to work in this film the music was for the most part excellent as well as akk of the fight sequences i am so happy to see a film that uses stunts instead of visual effects for fight sequences there have been far to many films with visual effects assisted stunts lately its beginging to annoy me but is still a good film that i must reccommend due to last houre and the beautiful sillouette fight scene as well as the one in the snowgrade b,cruel
in 1982 italian horror director dario argento made a movie called tenebre the most shocking part of that little film was when a woman had her arm chopped off and blood sprayed to all directions well over 90 people lose their limbs with even more squirting blood during the 111 minutes of 2003s volume one so a question remains in mind whats nextthe 4th film by acclaimed director quentin tarantino

superior and bloodier film tarantinos grindhouse dedication to the countless b kung fu flicks of the 1970s gets a grade auma thurman is the bride aka black mamba a nameless assassin who decides to leave the business and start a new clean life by marrying and having a baby but it doesnt happen that soon as her boss bill david carradine and four other killers pay a bloody visit to the wedding and slaughter the entire party before putting the final bullet inside the brides brain fastforward and the bride amazingly survived and remained in coma for the last four years when she wakes up after being bitten by a mosquito and soon realizes both her husband and baby are dead she has two choices either go on with life or which one she chooses you guessed rightbut before killing bill the bride will have to kill all other four hitmen that helped the wedding shooting oren shi aka cottonmouth played by lucy liu vernita green aka copperhead played by vivica a fox elle driver aka california mountain snake played by daryl hannah bud aka sidewinder played by michael madsenand in case you didnt realize yet is not to be taken seriously the convoluted and ridiculous plot line is only an excuse for powerful visual action scenes and dialoguethe movie is not shot in chronological order and starts with bw footage of the bride gasping in the church floor covered with blood after the wedding shooting and receiving the final bullet in the head from bill this moment is followed by the music cue of nancy sinatras bang bang my baby shot me down which is one of the many interesting

film to ever receive an rranting by the mpaa surpassing 1971s twitch of the death nerve over 90 people are mutilated sliced and diced like meat every time someone looses a limb blood is sprayed like it was coming from a water sprout in the volumes most impressive scene which just happens to be animated we learn the backstory of cottonmouth and see how she witnessed her parents murder as a child by a yakuza crime boss and later killed him at the age of eleven the animie moment has tons of blood sprayed all over the screen and the entire audience remained silent if tarantino had shot that moment as a liveaction flashback an nc17 sticker would have been quickly welcomedvolume one follows the bride as she travels to tokyo and acquires her sword from swordmaker hattori hanzo an excellent cameo by exaction hero sonny chiba and gets her first taste of revenge by confronting orenshi the climatic fight takes place in a twofloor restaurant called house of blue leaves that is when the

fight with orenshis bodyguard gogo yubari chiaki kuriyama from the controversial battle royale a japanese schoolgirl that carries a steel cannonball as a weapon prepare yourself for gogos subclimatic fight with the bride the films most visually impressive moment the climatic fight with orenshi takes place in a snowy japanese garden and it leads to the open to be continued ending that will leave the audience gasping for more after the final revelationsince i already stated this is a style over substance popcorn flick with a brain does that mean the acting is flat uma thurman doesnt play the bride she is the bride she has the most powerful presence during the entire projection and all of this is because of her breaktrough performance not a dramatic one but a physical one equally stunning is david carradine as bill he only appears for three minutes in volume one but his presence is felt all the way in 2001 francois ozon made a movie called 8 femmes where eight women confronted themselves because of a recently recently killed man they were all involved with that man only appeared for two seconds in the movie but you could feel his presence through the entire projection same thing with carradine here we only see his hands holding a sword but you can just feel bill the remaining cast all deliver their best overthetop performances very well with daryl hannah being deliciously over the top in a good way as california mountain snake a deadly assassin with one beautiful blue eyedid i just spoil the entire movie no not really the trailer already shows you most of the scenes with the blood being digitally removed  does that mean you should go see because of the grindhouse lucio fulcilike gore  no is not just about bloodsplattering fights hot chicks or character development it is a movie about cinema a movie on movies the entire thing takes place in the world of movies a world where everything is colorful a world where you can easily escape a hospital a world where you can cure yourself from paralyzed legs using brainpower a world where woman are considered equally superior to men and have a similar killing spree wish a world where characters take incredible amounts of damage and still stand up like nothing happened a world where a woman who just woke up from a coma can defeat 100 highly trained villainsbring on part two here comes the bride55,cruel
the story of volume 1 is simple the bride black mamba uma thurman is murdered at her wedding thought to be dead at first she wakes up after a coma four years after the incident through out tarantinos super charged first volume of the film she basically goes around seeking revenge on those who betrayed her the supporting cast features vivica a fox lucy liu and sonny chiba each cast member does fine in their respective roles especially thurman who manages to make the role seem realistic and she also did well in her more emotional scenes the cinematography by veteran director of photography robert richardson is beautiful to look at the fight scenes are totally convincing and the change to black and white flashback and at one point an anime scene completely fits the film quentin tarantinos screen play is mostly filled with brutal fights and japanese speaking which is a bit surprising usually tarantinos dialogue is the key element to his films but it seems there will be a lot more to come in the february release of volume 2 the direction by tarantino is as the title of this review mentions energetic and creative its definitely a throw back to kung fu films but tarantino adds his own style here and there making the film a blast to watch the violence is often comical especially since blood comes out of limbs like sprinklers all in all volume 1 is a must see solid performances great direction spectacular cinematography and more make this one very enjoyable movie experience 97510,cruel
tarantino does it again  as much as i want to hate the man well i do in fact hate the manjust not his movies he is a phenomenally gifted filmmaker  vo 1 is clearly the work of someone in thrall to movies  one of the reviews herein states that tarantino hasnt the guts to go all the way and make an exploitation movie but i think that comment slightly misses the mark  i think he sees the potential in exploitation and uses it as a platform from which to create beauty and arteven though said art might contain elements one doesnt normally associate with beauty cruelty gore coarseness venality  i think his use of brechtian distancing is quite appropriate and really very funny  sure one is always aware that this is just a moviethats part of the point not the entire point however or would not be such an emotional movie  i found moments of the movie nearly unbearableand they werent the violent ones  the moment in which uma thurman discovers a child has witnessed a violent act is not staged for comedy but for pathos and it achieves this in the simplest way  with silence with stillness  the overhead shot when the bride walks away from the child across the cerealstrewn kitchen floor is absolutely beautiful  and thurmans sobbing when she wakes from her comahow can anyone not respond to that  though the director wisely cuts it short for an amusing play dead gag it is a strong momentand an important moment in that it evokes just enough sympathy to put us squarely on the brides side  we know nothing about hershe might be the bad guybut tarantino knows we have to root for her or his film is meaningless but for all my pontificating im neglecting to say that is above all else really quite funny  the violence is over the top another distancing trick so as not to actually offend and it becomes comic  the brides thirst for revenge is not played for laughs but the vengeance itself is  who can be upset over literal geysers of blood  this is a good place to add that the stage blood is very well doneit may spill and shoot and erupt more than it might in real life but it does look realnot always the case in a violent film  the films single funniest moment is uma thurman throwing on a pair of sunglasses to disguise herself like the bloodsoaked hospital gown and the two corpses nearby wouldnt be cause for suspicion  the entire cast has the slightly stylized speech rhythms down and everyone gets their comic moment  daryl hannah makes up for a lot of bad performances just by playing it hyperstraight and therefore making her scene one of the comic high points of the film it helps if youre a depalma fanas i amto access all the humor tarantino throws into this entire hospital room sequence  and chiaki kuriyama is the scariestfunniest villain weve seen in quite awhile  its a smart performanceshe can play gogo utterly straight and very scary and still fit into the fabric of the movie because the sight of her swinging her chain while dressed in a schoolgirl uniform is deadpan comedy  and uma thurman is an absolute revelation  she should work with tarantino more often they seem to get each other or at least what the other one is looking for and capable of onscreen  she has to jump from sorrow to anger to humor she definitely sees whats funny about all this killing and every other emotion in the human spectrum often very quickly  it is a performance so completely rounded you know it can only be the result of so much hard work  and unlike say a deniro or streep we dont see the research  she is remarkably openthe emotions just come pouring out of herkind of like all that blood,cruel
this might be my new favorite tarantino movie with pulp fiction and reservoir dogs being my previous favorites  ive always liked kung fu movies and tarantinos directing  movie making style so when i knew he was coming out with his own kung fu flick i just said tarantino dont let me down  well he most certainly didnt let me downthis film rocks  its very inline with his directing cinematography style youve come to expect from tarantino a movie made up of short stories or segments that are somewhat out of sync in terms of a timeline  isnt nearly as bad as pulp fiction as far as jumping around  the only complaint i have is that you pretty much know whos gonna win in the end because its given away early in the film  its another tarantino trait which does take some of the suspense out near the end but its certainly made up for with the over the top blood spewing and genuine action of the fight scenesthe story is all about a woman uma thurman who is nearly killed by the viper assassination squad for reasons which i either missed or they didnt explain  anyway she after a 4 year comma comes back to avenge the 5 people who tried to kill her  the first movie theres a part two coming out next year is about the first two people on the listthe martial arts in this movie is great  very little cgi if any which im glad of cause it just ruins a movie in my opinion  there is some crouching tiger hidden dragon wire jumping but not enough to annoy you thank god but probably the most notable thing about the fight scenes is the blood spewing from chopped off limbs ect  its hilariously over the top but magically doesnt detract from the excitement and seriousness of the fight scenes itself  ill bet they used 100 gallons of fake blood in the movie i sure hope uma thurman got paid overtime for this as she definitely earned itcinematography is second to none as tarantino makes use of normal black and white cartoon and even a black light simulated scenes  his use of music is similar to what hes done in the past with his 70s style that strangely enough seem to fit every moment of the film  his thoughtfulness and attention to detail amazes me  i hope when he passes on he donates his brain to science as hes the rembrandt of movie makingin closing id say definitely see this movie if you either like marital arts tarantino or woman power  and for those of you who think he might ruin the seriousness of true kung fu movies wont be disappointed as he doesnt in my opinion dishonor the spirit of them  only reason i can think of for not seeing it is if you are really squeamish about blood cant wait for part ii,cruel
excellent this will finish a close second to lord of the ringsreturn of the kingblows away everything that has been put out this year and will be put out until lotrthis is an example of how to carefully put together a great action movie id suggest all the idiots involved in the matrix franchise ask quentin for his advice before releasing anymore of their crap wont be challenged by anything from the action genre for many years lest not forget the second half of the movie is yet to be releasedgiven that lotr the final installment will be done this year vol 2 will rule all of next year on a personal notei think i may have fallen in love with lucy liu shes the stand then some9 out 10its one point lower than pulp fiction also a quentin greatgo see it nowalthough some of you may not be worthy,cruel
tarantino has returned this time with a kungfu revenge story thats probably the most innovative movie of the year i wont go into plot detail or even an inkling of what the movie is about i will simply say that isnt your average 2 hour 850 movie that youll yawn your way through and smile when you see the credits at the end instead youll be captivated by the many twists and turns and illegal amounts of blood used in this movie the acting is all top notch the fight scenes are reminiscent of pretty much every good kungfu movie youve ever seen and the music is wellinteresting for this type of flick many people say this movie was a flop why because it didnt have guns and briefcases in it i say go and see this movie not once but twice there is plenty candy for the eye and no i dont mean a scantily clad uma thurman or lucy liualthough having either one of them scantily clad for even a scene wouldnt have hurt the movie this is a movie that i believe will give my beloved matrixreloaded a run for its money at the next award show in my opinion it has already won best cinematography best directing best supporting castbest fight scene will be the big showdown between and the matrix,cruel
before going on to the many good things i have to say about i have to state what undoubtedly has been stated many times before  i hate the fact that this has been split into two movies  yes i know it means we get two great movies but as one whole movie this could have been an alltime classic  as it is it is essentially half a movie and therefore return of the king will likely ensure that for the third year in a row lord of the rings gets the position of film of the year  however its a good thing that you are left desperate to see volume 2  i could have sat straight on and watched the next movie right away i was completely absorbed in this moviethe audience is treated to a fantastic opening shot in black and white where we are treated to a closeup view of the mangled face of the bride uma thurman  from the moment we hear a voice calmly say do you find me sadistic we know we are in the world of quentin tarantino with bang bang by nancy sinatra perfectly fitting with the opening creditsthen things are turned on their head as a fastpaced fight scene between the bride and housewifeassassin vernita green warms up the audience for a good hour of slowpaced but completely necessary exposition  the plot of the movie trying to spoil as little a possible centres on uma thurmans character known only as the bride since her name is quite bizarrely bleeped out whenever she speaks  on her wedding day bill david carradine and his deadly viper assassination squad of elle driver budd oren ishii and vernita green daryl hannah michael madsen lucy liu and vivicia c fox respectively slaughter everyone at the wedding with only her surviving albeit after being put in a coma by a bullet to the head  naturally she wakes up rather psed and makes out a death list planning to kill the 5 people who have wronged her one by one with bill being last on the list her ultimate mission therefore is to  get it  this volume focuses on her settling the score with vernita green the opening fight and for the rest of the film oren ishii with the complication being that oren moonlights as the queen of the japanese underworld and has a small army of henchmen at her disposalthe plot is pretty much that simple and follows this basic formulabride vs vernita  backstory  bride vs orenin chronological order that would bebackstory  bride vs oren  bride vs vernitaso far so tarantino  but as much as you can tell that tarantino made this film it is essentially different from his other movies  being an homage to his beloved cheesy samurai kungfu flicks this is essentially a cheesy samurai kungfu flick and in the hands of an inferior director probably would have sucked  but somehow it just works despite the surreal moments daryl hannah whistling to the soundtrack thats playing and corny happenings extreme closeups of umas eyes and at one point her toes the movie is as youve likely heard very gory  but this isnt shocking war movie gore this is ridiculous samurai gore  this means that a head is cut off and is followed by geysers of blood that pump away hard enough to hit the ceiling  nevertheless it may prove too much for the squeamish  one of the people i was with had to leave the cinema because of all the gore and that was just from watching the anime sequence which admittedly never would have been allowed past the censors if it had been live actionthe acting is all spoton  lucy liu serves well as the villain of the piece acting as a very effective diversionary villain before the real showdown with bill in volume 2  despite her tragic backstory her sheer ruthlessness prevents you from sympathising with her  nevertheless she is an unbelievably cool villainess with a scene involving what she does when the taboo subject of her half japanese  half chinese origin and american upbringing is mentioned destined to be another tarantino classic this is easily the best role of lucy lius career  vivicia c fox does well in the smaller role of vernita appearing to be a perfectly nice person apart from the fact that she helped murder the bridethen there are the characters we only get a taster of  we see too little of budd to make any real judgement of madsens performance but we can assume that he is going to be a killer with a conscience rather than a 2dimensional thug  daryl hannah certainly looks older than she did when last in the limelight but that suits the character of the eyepatch wearing elle driver better  in the scene that we see elle we can safely assume that shes a twisted vindictive cow  i personally look forward to seeing her burn in volume 2  and then theres bill  the fact that we never see his face in the movie only his ringed hand means that he quickly gains a blofeldlike mystique  we reportedly get to see much more of him in volume 2 which is good because i think hes shaping up to be a great villainbut the real plaudits have to go to uma thurman  tarantino was right to wait for her i cant imagine anybody else as the bride  uma handles the role to perfection whether it be in downbeat emotional scenes such as when she wakes up from he coma or in fight scenes kickingass  case in point the showdown at the house of blue leaves arguably the best swordfight i have ever seen and a battle which makes a mockery out of the matrix reloadeds burly brawl  if there was any justice in this world uma thurman would win or at least get nominated for a best actress oscar as i believe she has created what will prove to be an enduring popculture icon however there is no justice in the world and will be ignored by the academy because its not to their taste  dont worry uma we love youthe verdict  the one thing that stops the movie getting full marks is that its not a complete movie  essentially with most of the plot apart from the fantastic climactic battle being exposition this feels like an extended preview for volume 2  if that is the case then it has done its job as i am desperate for the next installment  if it is as good as this im sure well be looking at having full marks as an overall package 910,cruel
will save you all from yet another summary of the moviei was pleasantly surprised how much japanese involvement in this film from on and off the screenit is apparent that quentin loves japanese culture and bruce lee uma as billy lo bruce lees character in game of death where she wears a similar yellow jumpsuit and takes on the japanese underworld  not per se a remake of game of death but borrowing since this vol1 does not reveal the whole story we have a nonlinear partial story of black mamba with much of quentins campy characters dialogue and cinematic vision and cool retro soundtrackuma is surprisingly quite convincing as a caucasian girl playing with samurai sword rough quote from lucy lius character in the final fightthe action choreographer wooping yuencrouching tiger matrixetc has done a stunning job of making uma look super good in all the swordplay and despite the gruesome carnage were spectacular to watch and behold though i dont totally agree that the audience is to expect all these amputations as unbelievable or cartoon violence i cannot completely desensitize myself from these horrific images and if you dont find some of it horrific i am glad i am not in your high school or go to your post officeoddly most of the story was really about oren ishiilucy liu with much of it in animi and the eventually showdown go go yubari is a great distractionchapter 3 the man from okinawa was the best vignetteconspiracy theory could this movie have the subversive undertone that black mambaaka bruce lee gets revenge on billdavid carradinefor stealing his role in the 70s kung fu series that bruce actually wrote the concept for but the movie execs could never see a real asian actor play if in vol 2 there is a tight face shot of uma with a clenched face and the sound of bills neck breaking i will tend to agreerating film fan 910 movie critic7510 actiongore fan 1010,cruel
i saw on the opening day with my college class and all i can say is amazing quentin tarrentino has definatly done himself proud with one ive now saw it twice and will definatly be going again  even there though there is alot of blood in the film it doesnt seem to bother you because the way it was done it is very unrealisticall thats left to say is that if you havent saw it yet get ur arse down the cinema cause you wont be dissapointed,cruel
although the movie is inspired from the great hong kong flicks but still one must appreciate the way quentin tarantino has turned his influences from the hong kong cinema into this gem of a moviethe background music is amazing acting is almost flawless action sequences are mind blowing and above all the treatment of the story and the editing is absolutely greatquentin tarantino definitely is one the great directors of our time,cruel
last night i had the distinct honor of experiencing how my predecessor fanboys felt when they first saw star wars episode 4 a new hope in 1977 so exhilerated were they that as soon as they walked out they bought the next session and walked right back inwas that movie for me  and it was the first time in my 22 year life that i have done so with any filmindeed it was delighfully brutal and whimsically humorous in that unique tarrentino manner as it was touted uma thurmans punishment for an incompetent henchman is a hilarious classic and a halfand yet beneath all the macabre mirth lies a powerful tale of grief honour and righteous rageconservatives out there particularly christian ones may argue that no rage is ever righteous  and yet how wrong they aremr tarrentinos immaculately timed shooting schedule right after its leading lady uma thurman became a mother was for the lack of a better cliche a stroke of geniusfor her newfound motherhood lent miss thurman a powerful sadness to her performance  nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene where she emerged from her coma only to weep in grief and horror at the loss of her babyalthough primarily a martial arts tale it is the rage that poured forth from this moment that defined the sage  the heartbreaking sincerity of her grief that i silently cried for her even the second time i saw the filmand it lent an unparalleled sennse of heroism and justice in her otherwise horrific vendetta  each swing of her blade and each limb that she removed seemed to scream out you murdered my baby  and we cheer with her as each of her childs murderer gets whats coming to herthere is no warrior more noble than one driven by parental loverighteous is the rage of a mother avenging the death and honour of her beloved childthank you mr tarrentinoand thank you miss thurman,cruel
this movie is not to original i mean if you have seen  battle royale suicide circle versus samurai fiction and a few other asian cinema standards of the genera this film takes those movieswhipps them up  adds a dash of hollywood and presto is born i dont need to go into ploteveryone else already has but rest assured that if you are so sick of hollywood crap and you need a good dose of asian style funk this film is for you my only gripe the huge fight sequence was transformed into black and whitewith good cinematic effect that i suspect was supposed to represent the adrenaline rush that the bride has as it goes away with a blink of her eyes after the fight but i think that it was to keep this film from getting a stupid nc17 rating for those craving the fight bw sucked half the life from itif you have seen the movies mentioned above you will realize that this movie is a bit wimpy in the blood department and makes up for it with style,cruel
well lets start by saying it simple rocks i dont write many reviews but when i do it means the movie is worth it qt has outdone himself there is no slow pause moments like the first movies and he deserves a pat on the back for this genius go watch it,cruel
i loved it  as soon as it closed i wanted to see it again   i had thought id not like it  not particularly a fan of martial arts stuff  but i was wrong  adored the style and everything about it but in particular the fabulous soundtrackgossage,cruel
when i first heard of several months ago i didnt think much of it afterall i wouldnt call myself a fan or even an admirer of any of the people involved tarantino thurman et al at the time this film was going to be one of those ill wait till its on dvd or tv thingso what changed my mind the trailer it was one of those channel surfing thing and i came across it by accident for something that lasted some 23 minutes i was sold  it absolutely hooked me in it created anticipation for a film that i was previously indifferent if not borderline oblivious toso here i am a couple of months down the track made it to the big screen and my golly gosh this is a damn fine flick im not much for blood and guts and sure this is a splatter fest but there is  an inate beauty that surrounds it there is grace within the chaosseems to be somewhat of a litmus test of the filmgoing experience for me its an immediate like and this is easily the best ive seen this year anticipation is quickly building for vol 2 february cant come soon enough,cruel
i can almost  almost  guarantee that this film is not what youll be expecting and therein lies its truer potency an assurance that it can be included in the pantheon of one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces that this decade has so far seen tarantino draws from an eclectic range of different cinematic devices that help to lend the film a retroistic jazz funked kind of coolness interspersed amongst the luridly coloured incredibly sharp cinematic visuals are extreme moments of manga gore that help to underline the films powerfully self referential nature uma thurmans yellow and black striped catsuit is of course a motif redolent of bruce lees game of death and fans of the now sadly deceased master of martial arts will not fail to notice the similarity between this films closing scenes and those of  respectively  fist of fury and way of the dragon there is scant characterisation in this film and any details that we do learn about the films main protagonists or antagonists are revealed either through aforementioned cartoon flashbacks or statistical data such as you might find in a console game in other words dont go watching this film for oscar winning character performances the fragmented postmodernised plot is almost film noir and will keep you guessing and the setpieces are as good as anything youll see in a jackie chan or a jet li movie thurman plays the ice queen with panache and the soundtracks are used to good effect to underline the films constantly swinging transient mood the cinematography is well observed with switches from neon psychedelic crisp visuals to noirish moments clearly drawn from classic japanese cinema but its not action from start to finish rather the opening and climactic scenes serve as action quotation marks the intermediary scenes functioning to flesh out background and character even if youre not a tarantino fan and even if you have no real knowledge  or interest  in the genre that this film references this film is worth a look on the virtue of its vision and originality alone it doesnt feel like hollywood it doesnt feel plastic and in a world seemingly dominated by lifeless bland sequels this film makes a refreshing change,cruel
unlike a certain response i read here  which so happens to be the only one i bothered with  i have to say that this movie is a masterpiece of pulp fiction as only quentin tarantino could provide  not only has he included a litany of oldschool film references but hes managed to invoke with skill and purpose the spirit of the old hongkong action flicks that i used to stay up until two am to watch on cinemax  the anime sequence that introduces orenishii is breathtaking to watch when you realize that it was drawn rather than acted  again in a story that should have few there are many questions questions which have answers that will bring us in droves to the opening of vol ii  make no mistake i am no quentin fanboy his script for natural born killers was absolute garbage and jackie brown had moments nothing more  i went to this film expecting to be like baumer underwhelmed and overspent  i wasnt  what i ended up as was a smiling movie patron perhaps ambivalent about the good that this film will do for the human race none but still full of anticipation for the next installement  to those of you who find yourself predisposed to dislike this movie dont be  youll miss out even if youre paying attention,cruel
this movie breaks new ground even for qt  plays out like a virtual comic book  violent yes  sexy  you bet  entertaining  incredibly so  its replete with tiny surprises  qt has a way of mixing highly fantastical elements with gritty realism  the collective result of this hardtopulloff blend is what keeps your legs crossed your butt on the seats edge and your perspective on its toes  cinematography was nothing short of breathtaking and the sound effects especially those in the realm of all things guttural or the least bit moist were extraordinarily palpable  dialogue was sharp clever and economical  combat choreography was surprisingly exceptional  especially with the scene involving the rarely seen spike  chain though somewhat modified one also has to mention the countless subtle salutes to the movies of yore  the most obvious being the homage to bruce lees unfinished game of death  i so look forward to the second installment,cruel
i was disappointed  its merely average and theres too much padding to bring it out to a 1 hr 45 minute length  take the scene when the planes touching down in tokyo or the final battle in the snow between oren ishii and the bride  its unique and stylish but very poorly written  you can see how much exwriting partner roger avary had to do with the dialogue just compare this to reservoir dogs and pulp fiction   i just cant believe all the hype especially from critics  but what astounds me are the posts on these boards  qt is back qt is a genius 1010 best movie i ever saw etc  this board has to be rigged an 85 rating and in the top imdb 100  wait for the video  710 for uniqueness only,cruel
my first comments on any movie i loved itas i said to my mate as we walked out it makes you want to go out buy a sword and hack all the people you hate to bits it doesnt matter if there are holes in the plotslow bits in the action or i feel for the characters or not i never sat down to watch the movie with any preconceived ideas i let it unfold upon me will you like the movie some will some wontbut if you dont go and see it you will never know and you will have missed another of lifes rich experiences,cruel
i didnt go all religious over it as i am expected to the lack of content is not revolutionary the recreations of other scenes are boring the action is lame the martial arts are not really and the slaughter of asians wholesale for mindless fun doesnt appeal to me sorry to offend you i didnt say anything about that other than it doesnt appeal to me if youve seen a movie by fukasaku miike either of the kurosawas or tsui hark or the movie miramax wont release zhang yimous hero starring an actual martial artsist jet liwhy would you even care about this movie which by the way opened at less bo than once upon a time in mexico which no one celebrated  guess im not cool,cruel
quentin tarrantino once spoke about the infamous scene from reservoir dogs in which michael madsen takes his knife to a cops ear in the final edit of that scene the camera pans away leaving us to listen to agonized screams mr tarrantino notes that test audiences were far less horrified by an early cut of the scene in which all of the gory details were shownof course a good film maker wouldnt have needed a test audience to tell him this at least as far back as hitchcock they have understood that creating suspense is at least as much a matter of what you dont show as it of what you do in mr tarrantino has manifestly failed to recall this lesson here we see not only the ear but nearly every other human body part removed in full bloodspraying glorywhile i wasnt particularly disturbed or offended by any of this i did come away wondering what the point of it was the violence here is so supersized that at times it threatens to consume the entire film this is particularly felt in the films patient stylish and wellfilmed climax whos cutting edge is left dull by the numbing splatterfest that precedes itapparently one popular explanationjustification for all this violence is that it is so intense that it eventually becomes comical well maybe but i think it really depends on your idea of what is funny the road runner was violent haha funny monty pythons black knight was violent haha funny is violent icantbelievesomeoneactuallyputthatonfilm funnythen of course there is the legions of qt fanboys who toss around words like homage and pastiche like so many throwing stars dont you get it three decapitationsperminute is like a reference to old kungfu movies see  well these people clearly have never actually watched any of the old shaw brothers films to which declares itself a paean while certainly violent those films were rarely more than slightly gory if only because they lacked a 10 million budget for latex and fake bloodnonetheless qts mastery of exploiting the exploitation film is clearly evidenced in plot dialog editing and soundtrack  but for my money films like hero and crouching tiger hidden dragon are still much better genre reinventions because their directors dont feel compelled to hide behind winking poppostmodernism i dunno maybe im getting old but mr tarrantinos brand of irony just isnt doing it for me anymore,cruel

shogun assassin is a film from 1980 that has to be one of the best samurai films ever however it is not for the squeamish and the violence like is almost comical like when vincent vega accidentally blew the back seat passengers head off in pulp fictionqt borrowed a lot from this movie and i think in a positive way a lot of the underlying plot and most of the technical aspects in terms of the violence come straight from shogun assassinif you have seen neither film i urge you to rent shogun assassin first and show it to whoever you want to go see with it maybe hard to find at a blockbusters but it may save you the cost of two admission tickets when your date walks out half way through the movie because of the blood,cruel
this movie has a very distinct style and tone starting from the opening credits all the way to the end the violence and tabooness of killing a pregnant mothertobe on her wedding day only makes you feel sympathy for the main character and further enrages your emotions when she seeks revengestory and cinematography are top notch yet non homogeneous fight scenes are amazing and should make the wachowski brothers blush compared with their shrekanimation fight scenes however with the absence of music in some fight scenes made them feel awkward but yet in a sense very much more real the anime sequence seemed out of place and slow yet at the same time gave a more comic book like feel if thats what qt wanted then he accomplished it if not this sequence is better left out this genre jumping is distinctly different but is continuous with each person she pursuesis distinctly unique a slap in the face to the film industry i give it a 7 and 12 out of 10,cruel
spoilers at times ignorance is a blessing not having seen a single one of tarantinos movies i am free of any baggage that may impair my immersion in total enjoyment of the ride in specifically i am not distracted by thoughts such as how kb is similar to pulp fiction or different from reservoir dogs there are more than enough movies that kb reminds one of anyway from game of death bruce lees yellow sport outfit in a gender switch to matrix reloaded 100 agent smiths turned japanese not to mention the kinji fukasakus movies to which kb is paying tributesthe synopsis can be taken care of in a few words the avenger not to be confused with one of uma thurmans previous movie roles works on a list of five and in the process picks up a masterpiece of a japanese sword from a grand master at the end of this volume 1 which in turn consists of five chapters the score is two down three to go plus an almost predictable hook see you in a few months folksthe ride i thoroughly enjoyed including the fights the photography the direction and the music particularly the music just about every scene is accompanied by music that depicts the mood with uncanny accuracy my choice for the top three in order of appearance are the following the chilling tune mainly whistled at the attempted murder of the bride lying unconscious in hospital the tranquil accompaniment during the sword selection and the exciting overture on the converging journeys to the house of blue leaves the bride in a plane oren ishii and her cohorts in a fleet of automobilesa few words on the cast and characters uma thurman is well chosen and nothing further needs to be said lucy luis character received a lot of sympathy in this movie the fate oren ishii suffered was at least as tragic as the brides even though no loss of child was involved she is the only adversary that the bride respects legendary sonny chiba plays grand master hattori hanzo who wields a new blade for the bride in making the spectacular fantasy storm riders 1998 when hong kong moviemakers could not find a chinesespeaking actor with sufficiently formidable presence to play the villain conquer they turned to chiba twentyyearold chiaki kuriyama plays the seventeenyearold maceswinging bloodchilling bodyguard in a schoolgirl look her choice seems obvious as she was one of the most ruthless contestants in kinji fukasakus battle royale two members of the cast we saw only a preview of one is daryl hannah playing probably the most venomous of the vipers the other is gordon liu tarantinos much admired hong kong top martial arts star playing johnny mo a green hornet look alike but a villain while hannah will come back in volume two in continuation of her venomous activities liu will play a different character pei mei the brides teacher finally it is quite amusing to see the restricted rating worldwide any normal mentally healthy teenager brought up with todays cinema world will only laugh his head off deliberate choice of words with the proliferation of severed limbs and explosive gushes of blood throughout the movie give them nightmares or make them violent grownups lets be serious better ban roadrunner first,cruel
i is many things a lovinglyresearched homage to the hong kong action flicks of the modern era a showcase for uma thurman an example of beautiful production design a fun popcorn flick with a little of the old ultraviolence thrown in to discourage the squeamish  there are also many things it is not a wellcrafted story a geniuslevel example of timeshifting narrative two hours of witty reparteeknowing what it would not be going in and also knowing what it was supposed to be helped me manage my expectations  wo pings fight choreography is becoming so wellknown in america that some of the sequences here will be familiar to the audience as more than just homage  specifically a few look recycled  tarantinos time spent lingering on his heroine and her prey in staring matches tends to dissipate the tension rather than increasing it in addition his penchant for showing the narrative out of order is unnecessary here and further drains the story of the buildup thats part of the joy of revenge talesmy biggest complaint was how much quickcut editing happened in the fight scenes  from reading interviews it appears uma thurman was up to the task of the long sequences and that she pulled them off  many times i wished for a longer take a better opportunity to see the grace of the martial artists working through their moveseven so this was a fun time  the anime sequence is beautifully drawn and compelling  since the beginning of film animation has been used to show us stories that would be too horrific and graphic in live action and it works very well here  the overthetop violence and gore are laughable at the right moments as they were in pulp fiction  giving the audience a collective moment of reprieve just when the tension is at its highest  uma thurman shows flashes of better acting than id seen her do in the past most often when shes not speaking  and to be fair while the staredowns are buzzkillers i appreciated the moments of wary sizingup that happened in the middle of fights  this is more like what a real fight to the death would feel like  characters are given a moment to contemplate whether their next move will be their last  music is used well as in tarantinos previous effortsi earns an 810 for me based on how much fun i had  the real verdict wont be in until the story concludes however,cruel
as everyone knows tarantino is known for his crime movies quirky dialogue and foul language which is why with his forth movie a radical change to what his usual work is is a welcome sighti never had my doubts that this would be a good movie im am a huge fan of quentin and i will remain so for many years to come more so with this movie as he has proved that he is a director that can work on a bigger canvasthis is not his best movie i still think that jackie brown is his best and proves that he can mature with the right material pulp fiction and reservoir dogs were both fantastic films but with its twisting plot and fantastic style and grace jackie brown takes the crownplot was the only major downside to but what it lacks in structure it makes up for in style and acting i never seen an actor be so good in this film as when kevin spacey played verbal kint in the usual suspects uma thurman i salute you her breathtaking performance was enough to make me pitty her despite the fact that mercy does not exist when shes arounddespite its sheer greatness this will definately not appeal to a large percentage of the audience if you are squeemish then this is not the film for you the end half hour is a relentless battle between thurman and 100 of lucy luis henchmen so relentless in fact that the majority of it is in black and white to tone down the violencethis is very true to the genre though if there wasnt that amount of blood when being hacked apart with a samurai sword then it would look unrealistic it is true to the genre but it has a very tarantino feel to it stylisticly the man has matured in the six years hes been away we have one fight in black and white one done in sillohette and one flashback scene told entirely in japanese anime this is done by a man who knows what he is doing and is not afraid to show it offit may not be his best but it is certainly one of the best films of the year it has emotion style blood by the bucket load and a tremendous cast that bring the entire thing to life in the hands of a lesser director this movie would have fallen at the first hurdle but with the driving force of quentin tarantino behind the wheel we have been presented with an awe inspiring masterpiece55,cruel
is nothing short of remarkable  nine years after pulp fiction director quentin tarantinos fourth film is a wonderful narcotic personally i think tarantino though great as a director is limited in his writing ability  i know there are many who would disagree but all three of his films share a general form of dialogue a sort of hip70s retro talk that grows old by jackie brown  but in the dialogue is at a minimum and i couldnt be happier  here tarantino pays brilliant homage to the chop socky films of sonny chiba here appearing as a master swordmaker and the spaghetti westerns of sergio leone  uma thurman is flawless in her role  the fight scenes in their sheer brutality and obvious choreography beat the matrix all to hell  limbs fly and fountains of blood follow  a cool comic interlude allows tarantino to voice his inner bloodloving child in a series of bloody encounters  this film is tarantinos most enjoyable work and without the dull 70s dialogue the experience is enriched by the raw force  cannot wait for vol 2,cruel
as the trailer and the opening credits will tell you this is the 4th film by quentin tarantino  granted he has had other projects other than just four but this is his fourth that he has written and directed himselfvol1 is the first half of an epic story about a woman the bride codename black mamba who was gunned down at her own wedding by the mysterious and apparently powerful and yet unseen bill  the bride as she is affectionately credited and her actual name is bleeped out for dramatic affect survives the gunshot and comes back with a vengeance to do nothing else short of  quentin tarantino grew up watching samurai movies and serials  he has admitted on several occasions that they were partly responsible for inspiring him to make movies in the first place and that he has aspired to make a modernday samurai movie  is that movievol1 is nothing short of brilliant filmmaking  it has the pulpy feel of pulp fiction dare i say pulpier  it contains some of the brute violence some say gore of reservoir dogs and is even influenced admittedly from a number of external sources and including japans shadow warriors series old spaghettiwesterns and there is even an exceptional anime sequence right in the middlewhats interesting to note is that all of these influences are often times so clichd within their own genre one wonders how anyone could attempt to make a movie with those elements without being one big clich in and of it self  the fact that tarantino is a genius to partially quote my friend rene makes it possible for him to pull it off without feeling like weve seen this movie a dozen times alreadyin vol1 tarantino also has the knack of being able to push the realm of reality a tad over the top but somehow not leaving us in disbelief or disgust  rather we are left in awe his heroes or heroines as the case may be are not perfect and not without flaw and we can at times see them falter and i think that is what brings it down a notch from ridiculousof course vol1 is packed with preexisting music that only taratino could accurately select and incorporate perfectly into his scenes with perfectly choreographed action sequences and a haunting soundtrack to boot youll almost feel like youre watching a dance rather than a duel in fact on my second viewing both my girlfriend and i were both tapping our feet to the music nonetheless there is no shortage of pain sweat and blood to reenforce that this is a brutal battlepersonally i havent enjoyed going out to a night at the movies in a very long time as much as i had in going to see vol1 in fact it took me twoviewings to ensure i could be accurately inspired to write this review  people only mildly impressed by tarantino in the past may feel the same about however anyone who truly recognizes and appreciates his work will enjoy to its fullestnote volume 2 is expected to be completed this february  lets refrain from calling it a sequel shall we,cruel
so tarantino holed up somewhere in hollywood for five years and didnt makeanything well if this is the result im so glad he did this movie is pure unadulterated joyful entertainment anyone who takes the violence seriously is missing the joke  i was grossed out by the violence in pulp fiction  in this film its too videogame to take seriously meanwhile the movie is a huge big mess of characters scenes and locations from all over the place and they all fit together fantastically a great big commercial hit that is also an art movie created from a pastiche of b movies incredible i cant wait to go and see it againuma thurman is a marvellous action hero and makes you feel personally forher in a way angelina jolie never could,cruel
i hadnt heard very much about the movie but im happy about that because it surprised me in a good way uma thurman gives the performance of her life in  you really feel for the character and support her need for vengeance i was happy with the casting i thought everyone did a great job i cannot wait until volume 2 i have a feel it will be just as good as the first half,cruel
is everything you could want in a movie superb direction  fantastic scenery  great action sequences and some fine acting to boot what could of easily been a 2 hour action fest bore has been turned into magic and thats all because of quentin he has made a truly fantastic first half of the saga and i am waiting anxiously for the second,cruel
ok ill admit that i did know it was a 2 part film series  however by the time that had finished leaving a tantalysing wait till the sequel id forgottenthis has had much criticism but if people dont like tarantino then they just shouldnt go to see his films  as the bride left for dead uma thurman gives her usual good performance as she starts hunting down her assailants before she goes for bill himselflucy liu gives the best performance in a cast that features several of the tarantino regulars including michael madsen againworth a look although there is much gruesome violence  the swordfight with thurman vs all of japan is the best part,cruel
i just got home from the theater and im very pleased with  the cinematography is awesome amazing  ive always loved quentins movies and this is the best one yet  the soundtrack adds the perfect touch to this over the top masterpiece  all the acting is incredible  uma is great of course  props to the girl who plays go go  the 17 year old forget her name chaiki something i love her character  her eyes are piercing and there is just something about her presence thatsunique  lucy l does a great job and has a very intriguing character whose parents were both murdered in front of her causing her to become what shes become  the anime of her life story is great and im not really one for anime overall this is the best movie ive seen all year 1010 stars  go see it and when it comes out on dvd buy it to add to your collection,cruel
well so far the first volume of this film embodies all of what im interested in as far as movies  it has lots of action drama suspense violence subtitles strong actresses with strong acting abilities theres nothing worse than a bad actor seen a lot of that this summer and great use of genre mixture  i had no idea this movie had animation in it  i have never watched a quentin taratino film before but i must say this was a pleasant surprise to have all of my favorite movie types included into one picture  vivica a fox didnt last too long in this one but i guess she will be back in the second part in flashbacks  i also hear daryl hanna is going to get it in the next film along with of course bill himself  and she will also find out her daughter is still alive  very interesting  they dont even mention that when shes in the hospital  we all just assumed that she had lost the baby  but i tell these circumstances only occur it the movies  to have the tar beat out of you when you are pregnant and then be shot and still survive and make a comeback the way the bride does is totally amazing  i heard that taratino was obsessed with kungfu films when he was growing up as a kid thus we have volumes i  ii  samuri swords a whole lot of asian looking people and a bunch of blood and gor but its not horror movie blood and gor  i cant wait to see the conclusion,cruel
being a huge tarantino fan i awaited for quite some time i must say that im very impressed not only did it contain all the normal and beloved tarantino elements but it also showed how much hes grown and matured as a filmmakernot only was it inventive creative and visually wonderful but it also was very professional saying to the world im tarantino and i can do more than whatyouve seen well worth the wait and not to be missed,cruel
for all the critical complaints of all style no substance i say get a clue of course this about style the medium is the message you cant take this stuff seriously except that its all seriously funny i mean were talking parallel dimensions here samurai swords on commercial airliners only two bullets fired in the entire film no cops obviously fake miniatures of tokyo leading the film off with a klingon quotecritics take note this is pure unabashed postmodern fantasy i guess you could even call it porn whatever9 of 10,cruel
is at heart a pulp story an assassin left dead by her former partners takes on the whole squad when she awakes from a 4year comanow what makes special is all the references to kung fu movies bruce lee street fighters to samurai movies yojimbo to 70s series green hornet anyone tarantino combines everything he loves and he knows his audience is secretely craving all the nerdy stuff that is now becoming mainstream that we were all ashamed to watch before tarantino is giving it a little push in the spotlightsand we love him for that and we love the fact that all those people who pretend to understand have no idea where all that stuff is coming from culture is everything in art movies are no exception,cruel
i saw it last night   wow  really amazing wow like cinematic opera the sets the style the colors the music oh man the music the characters  its like he took a comic book a bruce lee movie a foreign film akira samurai jack mtv and mothra threw it in a blender then painted it on the screen  these characters would be so 2 dimensional if it wasnt for this stoneinyourstomach reality of revenge and retribution and its short only 90 minutes  never thought uma was much of an actor until now  wow  i was amazed at the fire hose pressure of blood getting squirted out also it is good to see that martial arts expert from crouching tiger back she could really kick butt in that school girl outfitwhen boss takamoto had his head cut off i laughed right along with sophie and the schoolgirlthis was the best move little toe movie i have ever seen  move over pulp fiction is in town ive never seen anything quite like this before i have to see it again,cruel
 what can i say  if the boring title doesnt instill any desire to see the movie maybe the brain behind it will  this was a very typical quentin tarantinoesque project  sly humor twangy guitars as background music yakuza deviant sexual behavior need i say more  plus all the gore if you can stomach the black knight in monty pythons search for the holy grail getting chopped up then you should be able to take this  some of the scenes were drawn out and maybe a little overdone but its all in good fun  my rating on a scale of 1 to 5 5 being best i give this a 31428571428571 or pi,cruel
is a strange mixture of styles that is inconsistently entertaining roger ebert once said few movies have as many good scenes as pulp fiction  i would say that few movies have as many good and bad scenes as i liked a lot of things in this movie several scenes were very well done including the bar scene with the master sword maker and the reluctant saki maker the fight with the ballandchainwielding schoolgirl and the anime flashback of orens childhoodthe problem with the good scenes is they arent supported by any of the other scenes in the movie  i would have appreciated some stylistic consistency the strength of tarantinos earlier movies is that they never lost sight of the progression of the story or the development of the characters in i felt like each scene existed in its own world there wasnt even a sense of rising tension towards the climactic scenes at the end things just happened one after the other as she crosses another enemy off her hit listlike many other people who have seen the movie i felt that there was just too much in the movie one extended plane scene would have been enough many fight scenes towards the end drag on and on as black mamba chops up guard after guard when we really want to see the big guys fight it out also too much of the action is focused on swordplay with the exception of one or two fights there is none of the energy and movement of other movies in the genre that i really enjoyed such as enter the dragon or legend of drunken master,cruel
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it took all my will to keep from walking out of this piece of trashi read some of the other reviews that people have written and i just dont get what they see in this filmone person remarked that people would be stealing from this film for the next 10 years i dont see how that would be possible as there wasnt an original idea in this movie if i want to see cheesy wire stunts ill watch charlies angels qt movies usually have fast paced witty dialog this had slow moving drivel dont even get me going on the cartoon stuffthis is the first movie that i have ever left feeling violated unless you are a huge tarantino fan save your money,cruel
vol 1quentin tarantinos 4th film is a story of revenge that is quite stylistic in terms of fighting scenes but lacks a story that stirs up the emotions of revenge in the audience it starts with a klingon proverb from the movie star trek ii the wrath of khan the revenge is a dish best served cold the movie doesnt waste time heating things up first we get a glimpse of umma thurmans character severely beaten face a sound of shotgun which supposedly should have blown her head off and we skip to the part where ummas character starts to take revenge from the people who did her wrong as we go along we are introduced to the characters of deadly viper assassination squad through flashbacksthis kind of backward storytelling where we start from the end and gradually move back in time through flashbacks may work for other themes sadly it doesnt work for a movie about revenge by the time  we get to know what has gone wrong between characters the revenge part has already taken place and the movie is over when we are watching ummas character killing her enemies we do not feel anything i admit that every scene is very stylish especially the fighting scenes however without establishing any familiarity towards the characters the scenes are simply unable to create any emotion this i found to be the biggest problem with vol 1 one might say that the real revenge will take place between urmas character black mamba and bill later in the volume 2 and by the time we get to see that happen we will have been acquinted with every little detail about the events that led to it even if this is true the volume 1 would remain to be a movie where an unknown character is taking revenge from her unknown assailants from the past the fact still remains we do not know enough about either urma or her assailants to feel the slightest emotion for either one of themquentin tarantino was apparently influenced by the old time chinese kungfu movies and wanted to make a movie where he pays his due respect to those old classics that led him to directing movies in the first place he does add his own style and humor to what is already a wellestablished a distinctive genre of filmmaking nevertheless a movie where you know so little about the characters is doomed for failure if you are interested in seeing a verywell shot martial arts movie kungfu combats and swordfight scenes embellished with super neat camera angles choreography music and editing then might be just your movie if you are expecting more than that then it will probably disappoint you if you want to watch a good revenge movie i would simply recommend first bloodrambo you will find yourself take side with rambo against the evil small town cop and when rambo kicks ass you will cheer for him as hero and take pleasure in the pain of his enemy something you will not experience in vol 1,cruel
tarantino resembles a politician that votes against his constituency once their votes  have put him in office  it is us that praised him after the shakespearian reservoir dogs after the  sophisticated yet lively pulp fiction sadly is just an extension of its own trailer and its entirety is just a trailer for  the volume 2 after all theres 8 bucks left in some of our pockets its spectacular to watch but from the souls point of view has no nutritional value this movie contains hundreds of winks to other movies comic strips cartoons and  whole cultural genres how would you like to talk to someone that is constantly winking to me it looks like the guy has nothing to say just tries to cash in on his past well deserved successes,cruel
this movie brings out a theme that quentin tarantino has hinted at before dont make women mad because they will kill you he is also paying tribute to several martial arts movies of the past five fingers of death five deadly venoms game of deathand many different samurai  movies he is also giving nods to different directors hitchcock in particular with his camera placement during key scenesit is obvious that tarantino places bruce lee in high regard because he has no less than 3 tributes to him in this movie the yellow workout suit with black piping worn by the bride the kato masks worn by the crazy 88s and the playing of the green hornet theme during a carmotorcycle ride the idea of one person holding off a rival army could also be seen as a nod to the dragonthe action the fights and the overthetop violence mark this movie as a definite ralthough im sure it could have gotten an x for violence not too long agoi had a great time watching this movie and cant wait to see the 2nd half next year,cruel
before watching this the preview for the film made me doubt that it would be any good  uma thurman wearing a bruce lee suit as a hero i just couldnt imagine uma thurman being an action star i suppose  well after watching it ive never quite seen a movie like this  the cinematography alone was worth the price of admission  this movie has very bright colors and excellent camera angles  every scene in the movie has been burnt into my memory some more than others but i know i wont forget this movie any time in the future the fight scenes were great ive never seen a movie so ridiculously bloody that werent animes  i was laughing every time i saw a limb cut off followed by a fire hose amount of blood squirting everywhere  it was like watching a live action anime  some of the scenes were just so great like the scene where lucy lui has the bosses gathered around the table and she cuts the insolent ones head off  i liked all the scenes with sonny chiba they were great  and of course the ending battle was outstanding  im glad the rope jumping was kept to a minimal it always bothered me in other movies  i dont care if some people didnt like it everyone has their own opinion,cruel
to be blunt this film is one of the worst ive ever seeni enjoy tarantinos work and really wanted to like this movie however has major flaws1  appalling lack of dialogue and narration this movie went for incredibly long stretches of fight sequences and gore allowing little time for the storytelling what has made other tarantino films work so well is that the storytelling was compelling and pulled together in a surprising way this movie feels more like a vehicle for blood and action where the story had to find a way to be fit in around that the story definitely seems like windowdressing for the action whereas in other qt films it seemed as though the action and gore were integral parts of the story2  limited appeal of the characters while you feel sympathetic for the bride and what she has endured it is really hard to care about this character or any of the others really they are not characters but are instead caricatures i have so little interest in any of them that i have no desire to see vol ii to find out why bill tried to kill the bride in the first place or if she gets her revenge on him3  unfocused editing quentin tarantino must have sat in a room one day and said whats the most disgusting thing i can do in a film that will have the least amount of purpose wouldnt it be even better if i did it a dozen times if at least half the overthetop fight scenes preferably 75 of them had been cut maybe this vol 1vol 2 nonsense wouldnt have been necessary someone should have stopped qt because he apparently couldnt stop himselfto call this film genius and a masterpiece really belittles films that are an artist can defecate in a museum but just because it came from an artist and is in a museum doesnt make it art this is the case with ,cruel
would you believe that one of the most anticipated movies of all time will actually exceed your expectationsstart believingvol1 is an intense shocking incredible experience quentin tarantino is as thrilling as ever but hes never been this epic the movie has tarantinos trademark quirky humor flip chronology pop culture references and buckets of blood but this time he threw in the kitchen sink including a pretty nifty anime sequencethe film revolves around the bride a onetime assassin attacked by her old gang and left for dead on her wedding day awakening from a coma four years after the attack the bride decides to exact her revengeuma thurman is the bride doing an excellent job with an extremely demanding role sonny chiba also does great work as the brides martial arts mentorvol1 s longest wildest and funniest fight sequence takes place between the bride and the crazy 88s an army of bodyguards in the employ of lucy lius vicious assassin cottonmouth blood spurts limbs fly and you wont believe your eyesyet for all its gore this is one beautiful and atmospheric work that is too breathtaking to feel like half a movie which is not to say that vol2 wont be even more highly anticipated than its predecessor not only does volume 1 end with a stunning revelation but tarantino is in fine form which makes his current film about as good as movies get,cruel
i hated the film although i enjoyed the style and apprantely unique filmmaking at start i walked out of the theatres in major dissapointment i thought the film was a tribute to the classic kung fu moviesit is not one may argue this is a new innovation and therefore its great i dissagree there toothe fight scenes were boring and uniinnovative sure  for people whos only used to the matrix crouching tiger it may be exciting but if you have seen some great classic kung fu films like  iron monkey once upon a time in china ii tai chi master etc  the fights in this film is completely mediocoremartial arts is art  this film makes mockery of martial arts its just some blond cutting everyone down with no morals or dignity the film was more of a japanese action movie style than classic chinese kung fu moviesoverall this is an interesting film for its visual style but disgrace to martial arts genre,cruel
this movie was so sickand thats sick in a good wayi love how tarantino does his magicwithout giving anything away a few things he did which were brilliant1 incorporating anime 2 black and white to color 3 the scene where uma exits the dojo into the snowy outdoors 4 the music before a kill is madejust geniusand finally the shot of the vermin squirminyou know which scene if youve seen the moviecant wait for part 2,cruel
quentin tarantinos boldly proclaimed 4th film episode 1 is a film that succedes on more levels than there are kung fu fighters in its majestic climax it conquers its violent and surprisingly vacant subject matter with consistent doses of visual and sensory flourishes that coexist seamlessly in a world where mr tarantino has free reign over his ideas and uses them to their most extreme and rewarding conclusions its violent its mindless and you guessed it  its pure cinematic entertainment on a grade a levelbefore we go any further lets jot it down for both good measure and vital importance quentin tarantino has obviously got a thing for the world of motion pictures asian kungfu flicks spaghetti westerns and the gritty world of exploitation filmmaking are appropriate influences here whilst big budget objectively based heart warming and arguably maniuplative epics are out unless youve lived under a mutliplex rock you are probably familiar with his past features films that focus on pulpy crime subject matter in a world of amoral colofrul charecters who are no more than fanatsized creatures in the eternal planet of cool ambitiously takes this genre of filmmaking into the next era with a sense of reckless ambition and skill that pulsates each frame along at lightning fast rates taking the viewer out for an experience once known as a night at the movies its important to note that rather than just recycling the similar dialogue based aspects that guided past efforts such as reservoir dogs pulp fiction and the overlooked jackie brown tarantino gives us a breather and brings us along for a trip into walltowall action territory marvelously does for action what pulp fiction did for dialogue it reinvents the genre by giving it new life steeped in both classic film history and equally fierce independant ambition its definately a tarantino type of film that doesnt scream the name like a broken record over and over again spielbergs and scorceses everywhere take notethe plot of isisoh right something about a bride who was left for dead suddenly awakes and is out for vengeance samurai style the timeless yet firmly fixed and idealogically bankrupt plot structure provides the appropriate springboard for a trip into the previously mentioned genres of grindhouse filmmaking bringing an elemental yet still dignified approach to the main charecter whos name is curiously bleeped out on screen is uma thurman the gen x femme fatale from 1994s massive pulp fiction we get all the melodramatic conviction and endless energy of an actress taking a break from the cookie cutter assortment of predictable hollywood roles set out for her and diving into a role with the possibility to really kick some butt i knew this film was working when the supporting cast featured a refreshingly nice performance from lucy liu as oren oshi a member of the divas ensemble that takes top billing on a to kill list devised by our heroine the scenes involving her personal militia herself and the bride will stand as some of tarantinos best work for years to come the cinematogrpahy editing charecter interaction pacing and the excellent soundtrack resound with a strong sense of achievement and purpose here and you cant help but realize that youre sitting dangerously close to the edge of your seat for most of it besides how many times can you really say that you sat on the edge of your seat throughout your film going history im not talking about anticipating the films end either im talking about being stimulated on a visual level that seems completely assumed and natural the kind that seem to have substance even if the plot isnt crying out for it with zealous selfrighteous appeals its nice to experience this universe sometimes as opposed to the heavy chin wagging mind twitching cgi universe that landed a couple years agoif you are like this reviewer and youre not all that familiar with the film influences or genres being cited here fear not and be thankful that you got an 8 crash cource in them rather than a latefee ridden year long excursion into your local blockbuster besides sometimes its more enjoyable watching a skilled director distill these things for you than rummaging through the waste bin of important cinema its rare that ill take style over substance but in this case im not going to deny it rather ill just sit back with the popcorn and gawk away at a film that knows how to achieve exactly what it sets out to mainly because it sets standards for itself that are precise and cliche yet somehow fresh and entertaining volume 1 works if you let it this is a great film out of philip jamieson 2003 volume 1 written and directed by quentin tarantino starring uma thurman david carradine lucy liu michael madsen vivica fox and daryl hannahset forth for an amitious film of this magnitude is what really captivates the viewer and make no mistake about it  actually is the first tour de force of our short century,cruel
yes this is what happens when you have enough money and time and talent and the right people to help you havent you all wanted to make a movie like this well maybe not like this but at least what you want qt has done this and more well this may not be a film of epic proportions it is certainly entertaining a no holds barred fight to the death cutsey dialogue and a killer soundtrack what more could you ask for  cant wait for pt 2 ,cruel
tarantino is a movie maker with vision and a gambler he pulled off a movie that will please and capture martial arts fans and non fans he redifines the way we tell stories influenced by only the old school great directors no cgi here just creative methods that boggled mind i love old hongkong action movies and old japanese samurai films now i add vol 1 to my collection i cant fully rate the whole film yet because i havent seen it it is split in half so they can make extra   but the first half definatly had entertained me a must see for all martial arts fans,cruel
the beginning scene was incredible and the fight scenes were as well the sound and special effects are brilliant but i did ask myself was it worth the money to see nope the beginning of the movie as i said in my first line was awesome but everything after that dragged on so much i could not keep my eyes open luckily a fight scene would break out and my eyes would open for a small amount of time if it was not for uma this whole movie would be one for the trash can her acting was top notch and i can really see her wining an oscar for it the plot itself was great but it seems he could not pull the whole thing together to keep it interesting would i see volume 2 well yes because they really do leave you hanging at the end this has to be one of the sneakiest money making tools of all time he is fooling you all with this piece of crap better luck next time and i hope if he does do a sequel to pulp it is better than this,cruel
behold the glory that is give a very unhappy uma thurman a samurai sword throw in the keys to a bright yellow truck affectionately named the pussy wagon add about 80 people for her to rip into and you have about 1 hour and 50 minutes of quentin tarantinos masterpieceno matter how much i had overhyped this movie in my mind no matter how great i thought it was going to be nothing i repeat nothing had prepared me for the end resulthad me smiling from start to finish  it had everything i could have possibly asked for in a movie and then some just for kicks the pacing was excellent the soundtrack was amazing and the fight sequences were absolutely fantastic  honestly the stuff you see in here puts all the cgi simulated fight sequences to shameuma thurmans go as the bride was spectacular  i honestly never knew she had it in her  the whole movie i had this malicious grin on my face that said hell yeah uma kick some ss  and for those who have seen the movie tell me that lucy liu didnt have one of the best scenes in the entire film  all i can say is quentin gets an a for the casting callas for the rest of it all i can say is pure tarantino  theres a reason this guy is as wellloved as he is  very few people could add such humor and style to a movie where decapitated bodies are pumping blood 60 feet in the air  it may not be for the faint of heart but it sure is deliciously funi loved reservoir dogs i adored pulp fiction  but has officially claimed my heart  you can love or hate tarantino all you want but one things for sure he makes some pretty freakin awesome moviesand this  this is truly his bestto quote the 5678s woo hoo woo hoo hoo,cruel
i really wanted to like i thought and still think pulp fiction was a masterpiece of creativity that was still realisticis a masterpiece of creativity but is a cartoon im sure tarantino meant it to be so at least i hope he did but it just fell in love with itself a bit too much especially the massacre in the restaurant which had no particular point to make after the fourth amputation monty python did it right  four amputations in one scene is the max anything more is wasting my timeim just guessing that wouldve made a good movie but expanded extended and then carved into two volumes it just gets a bit too narcissistic,cruel
quentin tarantino makes every genre worth seeing  i must admit that kung fu type movies were never my cup of tea but tarantino has certainly changed changed my mind  from the gangland wedding opening to the kung fu slayathon ending i was hooked  i wont spoil it for you by giving away any major plot points just trust me that this is a movie well worth your money,cruel
did the transformation from video store clerk to alist hollywood writer and director cause too much trauma for quentin  i truly think the man has lost his mindyou cant say that he got lucky with pulp fiction or that it was just a fluke  i think that pulp was one of the twenty five best films of all time and it took an immense amount of unique brilliance and talent to put it together especially with the limited experience that quentin had at the time  however this one gives credibility to the second half of from dust till dawn when the employees of the mexican bar all suddenly become vampiresafter being shot in the head and left for dead and after sitting in a car for six months and nursing her leg by herself despite the fact that doctors didnt think shed ever walk again little uma thurman single handedly takes on the two hundred best swordsmen in japan  yes that would be my one sentence summary of  if you want a reality based film with a cohesive believable plot then go see friday the thirteenth part six revenge of the nerds part eight or last action hero part twelve  if your thing is watching people get their heads and limbs cut off then this film should make you happier than michael jackson at a little rascals festivalreservoir dogs and jackie brown werent bad but comparing to pulp fiction is seriously like putting kindergarten cop up against gone with the wind  quentin what the hell happened to you  nobody is going to be anxiously awaiting the second part nobody is going to care,cruel
for fans of hong kong kung fu japanese samurai and yakuza italian westerns and other disreputable usually foreign genres quentin tarantino has fashioned an alternate universe in volume 1 that will feel wonderfully familiar and comfortable yet not without a host of constant surprises he does it all with a cinematic flourish that is almost nonexistent in hollywood anymore which might explain why he had to go to china and japan to do it there isnt a single wasted shot or motion or edit in this film those of us who get it and by that i mean those for whom it plugs right into the subconscious region of our brain are immediately swept up in quentins world and taken along on a wild gripping compelling ridei would argue that volume 1 marks the first true asianhollywood film hybrid in that it represents a complete fusion of asian and american sensibilities and styles moreso i would argue than enter the dragon the yakuza faceoff and the matrix to name a few you might suggest for one thing tarantino is one american director who truly loves the asian action genres he recreates here anime samurai yakuza kung fu etc and has totally immersed himself in them he has also surrounded himself with distinguished hong kong and japanese collaborators not to mention a chinese crew when he shoots asianstyle action he gets it right or almost right which is still more than any other american filmmaker has managed to achieve nor does he ever stop to explain anything as the yakuza admittedly had to or condescend to the american mall audience he just says welcome to my world and plunges us all into it not everyone will want to take this ride nor will everyone understand its appeal but some of us will need no map to follow it nor have to stop and ask for directionsthe route is already imprinted in our subconscious,cruel
vol 1 is the most violent movie made since oliver stones 1994 blood soaked natural born killers  ironically that film was written by tarantino  it is a well known fact that tarantino has an on going feud with stone over the way tarantino thought stone misdirected that film  for some strange reason there are amazing similarities between the way tarantino directs kb and the way stone directed nbk  unusual to say the least  they both use ultraviolence thats over the top at times animation mixed in with the live action and black and white is also used in both films  a chuckle can also be had by the fact that both films are photographed by robert richardson  on another note stone admits that he went way over the top with nbk and i wonder if tarantino will ever think andor admit the same for kb  i also have to question the legitimacy of kb as far as credibility is concerned in its believability  but then i thought what the heck tarantino has proven his skills as a talented writer and director so hes entitled to go wild this time  vol 1 is an expert action film that has superbly choreographed fight scenes top notch editing and great photography  for that i have to recommend this film  if you want to see a film that is well written and acted forget it  kb is not that kind of film  it is simply an action film no more no less with homages paid to japanese mythology and the chopsaki action films from the 60s and 70s  tarantino loves to rekindle the 70s and should audition for a guest spot on that 70s show or better yet try and direct an episode of that well liked show  tarantinos love of 70s music is also a pluskb is destined to become a cult favourite and one little tidbit that has to be mentioned is the fact that in the closing credits tarantino thanks governor gray davis and the state of california  interesting in that the same week this film was released arnold schwarzenegger replaced gray davis as the governor of california  long live the insanity of the golden state and the wild imagination of the movies,cruel
quentin tarantino has done it again  even with the minimal dialogue this film captures you in the first few seconds  even though some of the action scenes involve moves no real human being can do some of which you see in trailers they are done in a funny compelling way so it doesnt bother you  it is extremely gory and violent and has a sick humor to it which personally i love but if blood bothers you this is not the movie for you however if excessive violence and blood are your cup of tea  this movie was made for you  it was beautiful shot and even though it is an action flick emotion really shines through  uma thurman is phenomenal and should get credit for her incredible acting in this film  this film was a breath of fresh air after many recurring disappointments  i cannot wait to see it again and again and again  a  quentin it was well worth the wait  oh yea  and the soundtrack kicks again as usual,cruel
made for film nerds kungfu geeks tarantino groupies and the smarterthanaverage 12year old check your brain at the door batten down the hatches and prepare for kinetic overload not that thats necessarily a bad thing a paean to the shaw brothers golden harvest etal is nearly plotless populated with strawman characters and for the most part just fitfully staggers from one overlylong martial arts set piece to another a few stylistic fillips aside eg the anime the main characters are all female the male characters are all oafs eunuchs or sonny chiba the cartoonish laugh inducing firehose jets of blood shooting from severed body parts the action is pretty much standardissue chopsocky  been done a thousand times before and if there was ever a if youve seen one youve pretty much seen em all genre its kungfu moviesfrom quentin tarantino though i expected more and doesnt deliver i wanted to see tarantino create a new cinematic syntax to be dazzled like i was the first time i saw pulp fiction instead as i watched this movie i found myself ticking off the boxes of a mental checklist of what have become in the decade since pulp fiction tarantino movie cliches  umas feet nonlinear narrative episodic structure artcard chapter headings dorky pop culture references more of umas feet etc nope nothing new here nowhere in evidence is the crisp sharp as a razor tarantino dialogue the only scene in the movie that works on any sort of dramatic level is in the restaurant with sonny chiba and his assistant and thats mostly in japanese no when blood isnt spurting and swords arent singing this movie just sits there in slow motion like an underwater ballet for a fan of kungfu movies the bigbudget production values and slick soundtrack make this an extraordinary example of the genre for a fan of quentin tarantino its probably a mustsee well just because for me though it was a disappointment,cruel
my initial reaction to the trailers was uma therman could never do kung fuwhy are people making a big deal out of thisboy was i proven wrong  uma handles herself very well when shes actually on the screen i am sure there are a number of shots where theres a double doing the kung fu but you cant tell just by looking but the point is that this film is done with style andbrutality  i was in no way expecting this  the action scenes are top notch and kung fu fans such as myself will really be able to appreciate this movies actionbut there is so much more than flashy fight scenes  i would hesitate to call this an action movie because its done with such finesse and style and the story is told very well  whats strange is that there isnt much of a story its a pretty simple revenge tale but its given depth by the skill of mr tarantinos storytelling ability  there are plenty of laughs too and while not all the humor was my cup of tea i laughed out loud more than oncethere is a lot of cussing and a lot of blood so i wont recommend this to everyone but for fans of stylized action and some pretty witty comedy this movie is right up your alley  one of the best films this year in my opinion i wont hesitate to purchase it when its released on dvd,cruel
im one of the few film buffs out there that thinks tarentino was overrated pulp fiction was a good movie but i never thought it deserved the status that it has recieved  the same goes for the other movies he has written or directed  ive always seen them as just a bunch of homages smushed together with a lot of fbombs and nwords thrown in in order to be edgy with i will now take it all back  yes the homages are still there but it seems like he has transformed them into his own much more than he did with pulp fiction imo  there is little dialouge which is in more with the tradition of hk action movies  instead more emphasis is placed on emotion which leads to some very powerful performances by all even the character of budd who actually only has one line of dialouge and is only briefly shown in flashbacks yet he might be my favorite character theres still some witty comebacks and wordplay so qt fans wont be too disappointed yet he no longer steeps to the overuse of profanity as he did before  as for the music it was brilliant and i hope to get the soundtrack  it helped make the movie even that much more emotional rather than simply being there for effect  all of this combined with nonstop action makes a movie that will have you on the edge of your seat  oh and the cliffhanger ending you wont see it coming,cruel
what a hilariously bloody movie  loved the style  energetic fastpaced and fantastic visuals you could totally tell it was a qt movie  but as for the story crap  talk about the most overrated of the overrated i was expecting something with wit like qts past movies instead i got a simple 90minute gore fest  i give it two and a half stars out of four,cruel
i have read many reviews thus far posted here and many of them seem to miss the point i guess this was one of the best movies this year and by far qts best movie everbe warned do not walk into this movie expecting pulp fiction it is not going to be pulp fiction it was never intended to be pulp fiction and furthermore has absolutly nothing to do with pulp fiction what so ever this movie is entirely different and should not even be compared to pulp fiction because doing so would be like comparing mangos to rice in fact many people say that what killed jackie brown was the fact that everyone was expecting pulp fiction toogo to this movie if you wish to see the very best martial arts thriller ever made this movie has everything within its over the top action and violence its cleaver yet simple dialog and its amazing cinematography there is also some very serious and emotional issues this movie emcompases everything a movie going experience should be it made me laugh made me jump made me sad and was extremely enjoyable to watch pure ans simple entertainmentthe best part is that as awsome as this movie is its part 1 of 2 do not be discuraged by this however because volume 1 is a complete movie by it self i look forward to being entertained just as much during volume2,cruel
id like to say that i saw the previews and thought man qt is about to blow it uma thurman with a sword i grew up on kung fu theatre pretty much saw every martial art movie every made especially when i was growing up i really enjoyed sonny chiba and qts homage to bruce lee the game of death jumpsuit the classic tiger running shoes the fight in the japanese garden bruce v russian boxer in fists of fury this is the original title it was switched with chinese connection in the statesthe fighting sequences were great better than i expected qt used the yuen po iron monkey crouching tiger of course matrix and the wire techniques minimally with good taste the excessive blood spatter is the his homage to japanese anime i cant believe how well he translated it to film there is a scene with orens crew surrounding her car with bikes and on the bikes samurai swords these sublties are what made pulp fiction the bomb qt uses this very well in i was thoroughly entertained and was glad its not over yetorens bodyguard gogo rocks and the fact that she is asian adds to her assassin credibility was casted perfectly as well as acted qt threw down,cruel
first off critics write this off as a movie with little story and all action  not that this is a bad thing but but they are wrong  it is not action all and throughout like all the critics say  there is almost too much story being told for there to be comments about their being no story they have seemed to forgotten that this quentin tarantino and his big movie was pulp fiction in which it was not really one large story but a lot of little stories all connected through characters  is made in a similer fashion but a little modified  he makes it very clear that he is only telling you what is essential for every chapter  and each chapter has an incredible amount of story to tell considering that they are mere parts of the entire story  also the chapters progress with the amount of signifigance that it holds and clearly the killings werent done in order of signifigance  as for the stories being told the route story of the brides revenge is pretty much left at face value she is pssed and people will pay for ithowever the side stories being told have an incredible amount of depth mainly cottonmouths  obviously the focus at the start of the is not really the bride but her enemies which adds further layers to the overall film because now she is not simply killing faceless killing machines the bride is killing living and breathing human beings who have their set of beliefs and fears especially vernitta green  if anything this really hints at the brutality of the attempt at the brides death in fact the bride actually describes to vernitta green what it would actually take for her to get even and it is not pleasant  speaking of vernitta green that sequence is pretty much is metaphoric of how the movie will move after that point only in reverse  now the scene literally kicks off or more accurately punches off and they are fighting no holds barred and then they are interrupted and it returns to the slow tarantino pace with his snappy diolgue and slow movement  again that pretty much summurises the rest of the movies movements again in reverse because after that the movie slows down and we can really see the pain both physical and emotional that the bride is going through has well as her preperations for her next or actually first kill  the action picks up a little bit with the anime sequence explaining cottonmouths history and then it returns to the slow pace once again  remember this is quentin tarantino so the slow pace is not really a bad thing at all and allows him to simply show the humanity of these characters mainly the bride  and since he pretty much knows that we know what will happen he worries more about showing us what is happening in the moment then what will happen eventually now the performances were superb especially umas because it was more physical then vocal and why would she really want to talk when she has 5 people that need to be killed everyone else plays their roles equally well but not really as physical only exception being maybe vivica a fox becuase she doesnt have anytime to say anything and starts off defending  i would say the big suprise to me at least was sonny chiba  now i have all his street fighter films and think of him as that crazy assassin who pokes out eyes and rips off peoples nuts  in he has a more homely type role and it is more hummorous then anything else  and he plays the part very well it was hard to believe that this was the same guy who brutally and slowly broke a guys arm bone by bone in the street fighter  however the standout performance in this first part would have to be lucy lius she is almost the polar opposite of her character in charlies angels  in her character is no one to mess with which she makes very apperent in the film but at the sametime does not freak out or get overemotional  she is really cold and calculating and every action she does is planned out in her head before she does it now to talk about the action and to refer to the one line summary without a doubt simply becuase this movie has martial arts wirestunts and yuen wooping as the choreographer it will be compared to the matrix the big problem with this comparison is well they have absolutely nothing in common with each other  now enough abot the matrix  yuen wooping is known for his fantasylike  choreography that  makes fight scenes more like dances then actual fights  in this is not neccessarily true it looks more like an actual fight then a dance  he has been known to say that when choroegraphing a fight scene keep the swords banging to keep people interested  in this is a bit modified in the final 200 man battle at least  it is now apprently keep blood gushing and and slashes deadly and the people will stay interested  there are only brief moments that are genuine yuen wooping but the majority of the fight scene is almost entirely different then what we at least me are used to seeing from himas for the climantic duel between cottonmouth and the bride it is somewhat apparent that this is where sonny chiba made is other contribution to the film  it is rather slowly paced when compared to the fight scene preceding it but it is no less entertainingsidenote everybody seems to assume that the fight scenes are anything but realistic  this is because of the blood special effects and the way the fight scenes are shot at certain moments  however it is far more realistic then past american efforts at martial arts again like the matrix  there is very little so called flying and when people get punched or kicked they feel it  when some gets slashed by the samurai sword they either die or bleed profusely  the wound is not passed over like a simple scrape,cruel
this one took some time to digest when i left the theater  maybe it was bc this is the first film tarantino has made in around 6 yearsmaybe its bc of the almost unanimous outstanding reviews ive read on this board and though i usually dont listen to the critics theirs as wellwhatever it is this is one that will definitely leave an impression on you at the endnow i loved pulp fiction thought reservoir dogs was great and jackie brown was better than averageand from the previews and reviews ive read i knew exactly what i was getting into  so with this in mind i turned off the expecting another pulp fiction button in my head and sat and enjoyed what is the epitome of a guilty pleasure moviewhat drives this film is the acting and qts unique blend of storytelling oh yeah and the hundred or so severed bodies of unfortunate yakuza soldiers at the films climax which is the centerpiece of the film  all of the leads do greatand i must applaud qt once again for using his incredible knack for using talented actors whose careers had washed up at some point in the past and gives them the script to shine  the plot is simple an assassin is betrayed by her colleagues who turn her wedding into a massacre and she exacts revenge after awakening from a 4 year coma caused by a gunshot wound to the head  i love the sense of forboding with the hit list that she almost childishly engraves on a pad of college rule paper in contrasting red and black ink  it is one of those fine touches qt puts in his films that give them panache and flairalmost like a score card for not only the main character but the audience as well  and the fight scenes are excellenti was so glad to see actual fights with actual actors and little to no cgi  and by far the coolest part is when uma thurmans character looks down upon scores of fallen enemy from her blade and tells the mangled survivors that they may live but their limbs belong to her it is something that must be seen to appreciate but it was one of those rare scenes from a movie that really stuck with me at the endnow yes was a pretty good movie overall but i have a fair share of criticisms as well  first the pacing is really awfulin tarantinos other films they were all either fast paced or fast spokenin other words there was never a dull silence either bc of qts snappy visuals or snappy dialogue or the trademark loud as thunder gunshot effects  has tons of moments where there is absolutely nothing said where there is complete silenceno poignant thoughts either just plain silence also the pacing is really slow in many parts especially when you know a big action scene is about to occursome movies use buildup to justify this effectivelyits almost like some parts of this movie were thrown together kind of sloppily and did not emphasize on pacing  anyway this is a complaint of mine and it may very well not hinder others viewing enjoyment  another thing i found a little disappointing was the lack of really cool humor  qt tried many times especially in a painfully overlong scene with two japenese chefs arguing about who should serve the saki that failed to produce one laugh from the audience in the 3 minutes or so of dialogue but just couldnt deliver  he keeps this movie very simple and in a lot of ways it worksunfortunately lacking complete substance can never be compensated with artistic license  plus i found the anime sequence though i know it was paying homage to anime loversincluding himself a little overlong and frankly out of placei actually like some anime movies but it just didnt belong here and i couldnt wait for it to be over  now i understand why he put it in but like ive said about opinions others may really love it so to each their ownanyway i know volume 2 is supposed to be more character and dialogue driven which would be a welcome break from the mainly action and dramatic pause oriented volume 1  it is not for everyone but i know certain people will love it  i thought it was pretty good overall definitely not his best effort  volume 1 could have been cut to a clean 90 minutes which would have so very well helped the pacingbut i have the impression tarantino pretty much had free reign to do whatever he wanted for this project  at any rate it is a bloody good time at the movies despite many sluggish parts people who do not appreciate or like profanity japenese animesamurai movies or swimming pools of blood admist dozens of dismembered limbs should steer clear  anyone who is a tarantino fanatic or who can say yes to any of the above questions should definitely go see it  i fall more towards the latter of the two so i will give it an above average rating of 7510 stars,cruel
vol1 is by far tarantinos best movie this is coming from a guy who absolutely loved his other 3 movies the actors were all great but uma was awesome she shows you a side that you never knew she had lucy liu was real good too the story is also great and is explained in detail it is very tarantinoesque the scenery is also exceptional and looks great with all that blood more blood and guts than you would think basically this movie was great have i said great yet i cant wait to see volume 2  the riz,cruel
as a dedicated lifelong zealous aficianado of all genres of hk cinema i went to this movie strictly for the novelty of seeing gordon liu in a hollywood moviehes a martialarts movie demigod having sonny chiba along was nice too plus tarantino is also an hk action movies fan so i guess thats nice too however i am not a big fan of his worki was mixed on pulp fictionright after watching i though ok its pretty much an action flick with zero plot on a big budget pretty bad acting lucy liu is a laughably bad actress with zero screen presence a solid soundtrack nice sound effects and unusually large amounts of blood and mayhem the anime addition was a nice touch too and certainly he is paying homeage to several action genres  with mixed success but his parodying and homages to japanese and hk cinema are somewhat difficult to differentiateyuens action and fighting sequences are good uma was stuntdoubled quite well but as typical with his hollywood work fairly simple and much watered downso ok 65 out of 10 with an extra half point for having yuen woo ping and gordon liu plus a nice fight scene with chiaki kuriyama 710but waitafter thinking about it i started to realize that when one looks a bit deeper one finds this all very deeply disturbingthis is a new level extreme violence and brutality but there is zero cost 100 gratuitous all entertainment no suffering no crying weeping or wailing extreme violence and brutality with no cost is a sick concept but one all too common of many aspects of american culturelooking at yet another level one also finds this movie riddled with racist and deeply bigoted messages on many levels uma thurman is tarantinos aryan goddess who can take on hundreds of japanese fighters with only a few scratches an africanamerican assassin and a chinesejapansese assassin she is just so superior all the tired old standard bigotry against texassoutherners is present as well the point where she spanks the one remaining sword fighter was the coup de grasthis is a disturbing and pointless exercise is racism bigotry and gratuitous violence created by a little white american boy who has a lot to learn this is absolute rubbish in every sense of the word,cruel
im not going to go into plot details because theyve been explored on this site so many times its just old hat i saw this film last night and i cant stop thinking about it it has to be one of the most violent movies ever made well the most violent movie ive ever seen however the violence is stylized and in the hands of any other director would really become graituitious the film is most definately pulp and every frame bleedsno pun intended tarantinos love for asian cinema spaghetti westerns and various other references that this humble viewer wouldnt pick up in a million years many of criticized the film for being antiasian ok i can understand that if this film was set in the real world but to say that this is set in the real world is to say that the indianna jones films are set in the real world which is just not the case like the indy movies lives in our cinematic imagainations what i mean by this is that this film is a cinematic other world im not exactly making much sense i understand that but this is a post modernist film at its best it is a n amalgamation of every genre film that has come out in the past 4050 years so anyone criticizing the film for portraying the yakuza in a diferent light than most needs to understand that when uma thurmans character the bridewhose name is bleeped out purely for effectflies into japana godzilla set she is not flying into japan she is flying into our collective movie going imagaination of japan i dont know if that made any sense im glad that miramax and tarantino decided to split the movie into two parts for one thing it needs an intermission the violence although stylized is still intense enough to warrant a intermission and its good too bc than a person like myself can get aquainted with tarantinos referencesanother thing has to said about how tarantino has now reinvented the action movie for one all the male characters are not the heroes in fact all the main characters in this first volume are all women i will go on record here and say that uma thurmans the bride will become an iconic image of this decade and speaking of uma thurman she does a fantastic job with an entirely physical performance we see the rage in her voice and eyes and seeing her with a samurai sword gives us a thrill and sonny chiba provides the films spirtual centerso to speak giving one of my favorite lines in the whole movie i can tell you with no ego that this is my finest sword if in your journey you should encounter god god will be cutthere is so much more to say about the other actresses in the film who all do an amazing job i liked lucy liu for the first time vivica a fox who i havent seen for a while does a great job so much to say and not enough time to say it i gotta say though if you cant handle violence stay as far away from this movie as humanly possible whereas unlike tarantinos other movies where the violence stays off screen he keep the camera focused on itand as for volume 2 in febuary i am so there,cruel
wow i went into the theatre expecting another crap film like pulp fiction but i was suddenly immersed in a drama that knows no bounds when it comes to filmography  i wasnt sure exactly who directed this but i found out who it was and he did a great job with the symbolism particulary the references to jesus and many other biblical figures  as good as it was i still prefer bend it like beckham much more but if this is all i could see i would recommend attending a viewing  this film renews my hope in speilberg and i cant wait to see whats in store for us later  i hope they do a part two,cruel
oh my god quentin tarantino is brilliant  this movie is pure unadulterated bliss  exhilaratingly entertaining from start to finish  i had a big fat smile plastered across my face the whole time  its too bad they chopped this in two because i would without whimper or complaint sit through a five hour movie if it were as deliriously wonderful as this one,cruel
quentin tarantinos is definitely not a film for everyone and certainly not for the squemish  the film is overthetop with severe graphic violence blood spurting in huge geysers limbs being hacked off by swords and axes landing in the middle of human heads  it is also a deeply transgressive film  uma thurmans character is beaten shot and left for dead when pregnant then spends four years in a coma with her inert body being pimped out by an orderly while lucy lius character is featured in an anime flashback in which a child watches the graphic murder of her parents and then takes her revenge by using herself as bait for a pedophile yakuza boss  the film has obviously questionable morals and equally questionable artistic value  the dialogue is sparse much sparser then tarantinos past films and lacks much of the videonerd goofballmundane humor that made pulp fiction so memorable  the barebones plot style characterizations and music are all highly derivative  explicitly borrowing andor ripping off per my observations sergio leone spaghetti westerns 70s shaw brothers kungfu films the 60s yakuza noir thrillers of sejun suzuki blaxploitation movies bgrade revenge films like walking tall or the xrated i spit on your grave the anime and manga crying freeman the green hornet tv show bruce lees game of death and 70s samurai potboilers like lone wolf and cub and hanzo the razor whew in addition miramaxs decision to slice the film in half leaves the viewer with an unfortunate feeling of incompleteness    and i loved ever single sick minute of the entire thing and will probably watch it ten more times in the theater,cruel
as corny as the title of this comment is there is no denying the true potential of this movie to reach the mountaintop of cinematic greatness astonishing enough this is only the first part and if one segment of two segments total can blow away consciousness and thought it can keep you on your toes for volume 2vol 1 is the perfect exaggeration of life and reality if life was given a slight sadistic charge to it this movie would be the envision of that nether dimension exaggeration the consistency of action and gore and the outrageous but aesthetically incredible decapitations as understood about this movie this is quentin tarantinos tribute to many of his beloved diehard genres such as spaghetti westerns and kungfu movies it goes without saying that his tribute is a redefinition and reinvention of each genre he basically made this movie with the melting pot of genres his ownkudos also goes to uma thurman for all the anguish she had during the shoot while acting out the anguish of one woman a question that should arise from this movie might be whether or not thurman may take the high step to actressdom or being one of the revered and sought after actresses in hollywoodthis movie captured the brides anguish perfectly even though this movie may be classified only as action driven rather than character driven nevertheless quentin along with thurman created a character that transforms from mystery to womanonamissiongodfather made people scratch their heads after seeing it because they wanted to check recheck and check again if they were seeing the unthinkable and incredible matches that mindset and state it can be thought more and more and seen more and more but the action will mesmerize and graciously stupify you into awe to quote will ferrell as james lipton looking at this movie is like looking into the face of god,cruel
after 6 long and agonizing years tarantino junkies can finally rest easy volume 1 has arrived its incongruous mishmashing of kungfu grindhouse and spaghetti western makes for a mesmerizing horrifying and completely incredible moviegoing experience its rather unfortunate that one can assume that tarantinos skill will once again be ingored by the academy just like he was for his most mature directing job to date jackie brown but anyone that sees this film will agree that its not likely one youll forget pulp fans keep an eye out for the red apple cigarette billboard  9 of 10,cruel
quentin tarantino proves with vol1 that he really can do no wrong right from the opening sequence youre strapped in and clutching the arm rest of your seat is about the bride aka black mambas uma thurman odyssey of revenge when she is beaten and left for dead by her fellow assassins on the order of her boss bill david carradineon her wedding day she goes into a coma only to awaken 4 years later thirsty for vengeance she makes a list of the people that betrayed her and goes on a absurdly violent killing spree the plot is very thin for this half of the show but tarantino promises a lot more dialog in vol2 the films highlights are the way the movie unfolds it isnt a linear story at all with tarantino it never is but its still damn entertaining we learn the origin of oshiren lucy liu in a kick ass anime sequence we see the bride receive the weapon she will use on her quest from the man who trained her enemy and we see the end all beat all of fight sequences in the showdown at the house of blue leaves which promises to astonish and amaze something that i have always admired about tarantino is his taste in music he always seems to find the right song be it a japanese rock tune or mexican type surfer music that fits the scene perfectly the nancy sinatra song that plays over the opening credits is perfect and so is the rock song that plays during the house of blue leaves melee the one problem is that the movie is way too short only 90 minutes i would have preferred to see both volumes as one 3 hour long epic but it does end on a great cliff hanger line that comes out of nowhere i honestly cant describe with words the perfection of the fight scenes from the screams of pain to those whove had their limbs chopped off to the brilliant choreography but i will say that this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart the violence is extreme and over exaggerated i went to see it with friends whom a few werent used to insane violence and they cringed and covered their eyes but me and the others who have been desensitized loved every blood soaked minute a movie about vengeance has never been so intriguing you really feel for this character and root for her as she seeks restitution from the people that took so much away from her things i cant mention without spoiling the movie bill or what is seen of him is played very frightening and worthy of a slice from the brides samurai sword all and all this is a great movie that would probably reach the heights of perfection if seen as a wholerating 12 out of ,cruel
what a bloodfest  what a sick flick  i loved it in fact i loved it so much i saw it twice  awesome fights  lots of violence and bloodspray  yes i said bloodspray the blood doesnt just flow it gushes and sprays in this sword swinging flick  i cant wait for vol ii,cruel
after whats seem like an eternity quentin tarantino finally returns with his sendup to the grindhouse films as well as plenty of other styles in while the movies plot is relatively simple and much easier to summarize than any of tarantinos previous films that doesnt make it any less enjoyable it is a departure in many ways volume i contains considerably less dialogfocused character development than any of his other films  the action and violence is at the front of this flick  tarantino once described reservoir dogs as seeming a lot more violent than it actually was because of the threat of violence that looms over each scene and there were actually only a handful of occasions where violent acts actually occurred  with there is so much violence that it seems awkward when there is downtime  in a scene where uma thurman visits japan and is having a fun little chat with the propriater of a restaurauntbar there may be a term for such an establishment in japanese that i am missing uma is all cutesy and fun and its hard to believe shes the same woman dicing up punk after punk in the rest of the film  the word awkward is a bad choice as it tends to have bad connotations  there is nothing wrong with the nonaction packed scenes in this film speaking of action packed this film is packed with action  there have been complaints that tarantino is not a very good action director  well the morons who say that dont realize hes not an action movie maker  they were much more dramas with occasional acts of violence that didnt require explosions and ellaborate action sequences  but is an action film and tarantino directs it brilliantly  there is also a great deal of variation in how the action is executed and revealed  every bloodsoaked moment is a surprise this is also tarantinos most artistic film today employing everything from blackandwhite scenes which may have been due to the excessive blood animation birds eye shots oblique angles there are far less long shots in this film the story is divided into title chapters the pace is much faster than the usual tarantino style probably cuz theres so many people to kill and so little time and the scene where uma thurman and lucy liu have a oneonone sword battle is film in a beautiful japanese garden in the snow amazing mise en scene it really reads like a graphic novel a comic book  it might not be the deepest tarantino film but it is certainly the most epic  and theres still another hour and a half to go  i cant wait,cruel
it was nifty to see anim and japanese samurai used as the backdrop of this film  at first the fountain like blood sprays provided the darktwistedcomical quality that makes tarantino flicks nifty however after 34 of the movie it was just over donelosing its meaning and losing my attention  no matter what casting uma thurman was simply smart thurman being one of the coolest cats in hollywood has certainly done her job right  ultimately it was well worth my time but it was too much of what i had expected a tarantino film to be  maybe ill be surprised in vol ii,cruel
i liked the first half of the movie but the overthetop fighting scenes are just way too much for me when a movie starts getting just too damned unbelievable then i cant help feeling boredi also feel disappointed when i finally realized how simple the story really iswell having said that theres still a lot of originality and coolness in this film to make it kind of a mustsee,cruel
its funny to learn tarantinos earlier life in a video store for example when we consider that this man did one of afis top 100 movies pulp fiction somehow i think it does give great hope to young film makers that dream of having their passion as their job  his story is interesting nonetheless if you learn how he got reservoir dogs done and then pulp fiction and jackie brown and thentarantino does something very special herehe does everything a film maker could ever dream of a movie for himself a movie he does cherish as much as some people will do in a couple of years when is going to be a cult classic  a movie in which he pays homage to oriental cinema while lucio fulci fans will be totally pleased to see guts being spilled and people being sliced and diced in very bloody fashion  also tarantino does punctuate the film with his own style which has become a landmark in american cinema  here we get many things that differentiate from an conventional institutional film the chronology which is as usual in a tarantino movie like a puzzle in which all the short stories finally fit well together there is also the very appreciated presence of an amazing anime sequence in the middle of the film the fact that some scenes are in black and white and not always to symbolize flashbacks maybe in the case of vol1 it was only to avoid an nc17 rating though but ill talk about that later and to top it all we got way too much blood and gore for a typical american film which vol1 definitely isntnow it really is evident that tarantino did watch many japanese movies the animated part in his film is just as great and has the same crazily japanese feel to it than akira for example  the animation is done quite beautifully much better than any manga but still keeps a very oriental aspect  also the combat scenes especially at the end keep the spirit and slow pace of classic japanese cinema think of kurosawa or kobayashi yeah aside from all that crazy gore and limbs that fly all over the room the honouroriented aspect of the sword fights and the choregraphy just help to make of vol1 a true homage to samurai films  yes it is an american film yes thats also something youll feel while watching it but it is not common at all and it really makes an interesting mix of genres which i think only the tarantino blender could put back together to obtain something very interesting  yes it did bother me a little at first to see that the fight against the 88 men in the restaurant was suddenly turning to black and white  yes the violence impact was mostly gone because of that but really with the grainy picture and the sound changing too for a moment i really thought i was watching a better version of shogun assassin with better camera angles and much much more blood  and then right after that comes a fight which is shown only in shadowgraphwonderfulvol1 and probably the whole film does not really suffer from its very thin storyline which is stylistically exploited to its maximum yes its just a plain story of revenge but remember that tarantino is behind it  and by the way another movie last year had pretty much the same storyline and was considered by many which include myself as an excellent film gangs of new york  these two films exploit one of the oldest subgenres ever the revenge flick  scorseses film had an amazingly delivered historical background to it but tarantinos has something hard to describe  one thing is sure though substance is not the main attraction here  but who cares  this film expresses the fundamental joys of cinema from someone who truly had fun making his baby  and it does make a great homage to oriental movies  and it sure delivers lots of entertainmenttarantinos directing is as always pretty good while improvement has been made here his three previous films were shot like as he said himself good old boring television but punctuated with some great shots and a pretty interesting knowledge in directing  but in vol1 tarantino keeps his good old habits but adds some new things to his direction  the black and white scenes are part of that as well as some very dynamical camera procedures  i would say vol1 for right now because i havent seen vol2 is not tarantinos best film  but for the direction its the most original and probably the best though his style did fit better in his other moviesthe actors are all great  uma thurman is pretty good as the protagonist but david carradine which we dont really see in the first volume was frightening in his parts  also lucy liu does a great job as oren ishi a professional assassin with a very dark past  all the others are very good toothe soundtrack is brilliant really  thats a tarantino trademark too the music is just perfect for the film bringing incredible energy to the colourful and beautiful images which are delivered in a splendid and versatile photography  tarantino uses different colour textures and image grain for the different scenes as well as the sound  yes those things are apparent which is something many people might dislike but trust me it does add a lot to the style and and value of this filmso overall as a first volume this was good very good sure it is not as good as reservoir dogs or pulp fiction but it does have bite and a lot of it and to be honest ill be impatiently waiting for the second volume to be released8510,cruel
most trailers for were careful not to reveal how deep the movie itself really is and for good reason  director quentin tarentino was more than likely intending for the films major target audience to be fans he has won over in the past pulp fiction reservoir dogs and to let the success of the film speak for itself  being familiar with tarentinos niche for clever usages of timeframes and scene changes i walked into the theatre knowing what to expect  not only was i wrong but i was glad that my assumptions were falsethe story begins explaining how a woman uma thurman who goes by the alias black mamba was murdered by a quartet of assassins on her wedding day she mysteriously survives a gunshot wound to the temple and her strong taste for revenge to be dealt amongst the culprits outlines the plot that will ultimately become the series  from the very start the film is soaked in asian cinematography subculture including plenty of martial arts conflicts japanese voiceovers and surprisingly a 20minute long segment of the film that is presented entirely in anime format japanese animationfor those familiar with the asian style of common horror flicks blood is poured by the truckload severed limbs are in great supply and the themes of honor and respect seem to be valued above all else  it is this stylistic backdrop that makes as refreshingly unique as it is  one cant help but form a comparison with the matrix trilogy specifically for the two films heavy use of martial arts  in my opinion triumphs on all frontsfans of tarentino films will doubtfully be disappointed  is an excellent example of prime storytelling with just the right amount of character development to seed in with the entertainment value that most people will pay the matinee for  since the first volume of the series doesnt resolve a final conflict it will eagerly have you awaiting the next episode  overall one of the most intelligently creative films ive seen in quite some time  9 out of 10,cruel
i have been a huge tarantino fan myself i have always loved his insight and wit in his works i know he owes asian filmmaking tradition much in his creation but i never thought that he lacked his creativity or originality i rather admired his sense of style introducing flawlessly the part of that film history to his works without really ripping it off he might have borrowed some ideas but there have been many other things brilliant other than just homage to its tradition at least before vol 1unfortunately vol 1 can never be one of tarantinos masterpieces so far at best it is no more than his soso work although i am hesitant to say ripping off it too much depends on asian cinema stereotypes especially focusing on the cheesy onesdo not misunderstand me trust me vol 1 was really entertaining unless you hate his bloodthirsty taste acting was overall good especially uma thurmans performance was very impressive to me all the characters are well defined the chainthrowing school girl you know she is really almost 20 years old not 17 years old oneeyed daryl hannah and the japanesespeaking star track vixen are all lovable if you did not watch the movie you may not understand what the heck i am talking about the scenes are well captured and connected especially if you have never seen the real japanese animation i am not talking about pokemon you will have the taste of the finest of the finest of its kindalso as an asian that i am i have to admit that his understanding of asian movies stories and even music are more than just a superficial level although he probably got some helping hands i laughed a lot listening to typical japanese note of the background music on the scene after the duel of uma and lucy and especially when uma and lucy are talking about the craftsmanship of the sword even at the very end of lucys life i was quite impressedhowever it was too typical nothing new especially for asian people let me say one thing to the people saying that the movie has something new unique or saying that the movie is the best of this year or alltime asian moviegoers have gone through tons of better ones if is that great for example jet li has had tons of better mass fighting scenes in his early works than umatoeveryone else in i have even seen those onetoeveryone fighting scenes in tv soup operas many times this year so please save the expression the best until you see the originals in addition another complaint would be that i almost smell of stereotyping and orientalism however while it is not certainly pleasing i would not discuss it more because stereotyping and school girl fetish certainly sellagain dont misunderstand me i enjoyed this movie a lot i am just saying that it cannot be the masterpiece like many people think and that tarantino could have done better than this is nothing more than just a mishmash of things asian unlike his real former masterpieces and tarantino just succeeded in entertaining people putting the mishmash in the context of hollywood,cruel
while not being a total fan of quentin tarantino per se his latest cinematic presentation was top notch  it has better choreography than crouching tiger hidden dragon smarter comedy than all movies in my recent memory and evokes more thought and emotion in the first half hour than many oscar winners do in the entire film  while being a stunning and practically perfect example of filmmaking at its finest perhaps what is most noteworthy is that the movie is incredibly easy to watch  mind you the blood and guts are not for the weak of stomach but the violence is magnificently choreographed graceful and a perfect example of what eastern filmmaking could produce if the crews had a hollywood budget  i am going to step out on a limb and say that this film while being way too graphic for the tastes of the academy deserves the title of best film of the year,cruel
is one of those great movies that you instantly want to review as soon as you step out of the theater i await the second with a vengeance second only to bubba ho tep for all of you bruce campbell fans this movie had so many laughs you would almost expect it to be a comedy but in truth of fact it is one of the kings of action this year so go to the theater and check it out,cruel
while watching the trailers for the movie on tv i wondered how good could a revenge movie be but from the moment it started tarantino set the tone of humor intensity fierceness and overthetopness marvellously edited such that it drew you in but not so far in that you would take it all that seriously it seemed to be telling the audience arent these martial arts films so hokey but dont you love the asskicking anyway the saving grace of the movie is that while it is telling the story of fierce revenge it continually makes fun of itself so that you are laughing with the movie not at it uma thurman looked radiant at time lucy liu once again played the perfect cold hearted bitch  did her scream at the yakuza gathering remind you of amanda plummers hysteria in the final restaurant scene in pulp fictionbut a warning this is not only a high body count but a high severed limb count and if you at all squeamish at bloodletting go see a chickflick,cruel
okive seen 1 twice now and i want to tell everyone a little about itno real spoilersjust some thoughtscommentssobefore i beginid like to say that yes i am a huge tarantino fan i would like to think however that this does not bias my opinion about 1 i try to stay objective in my reviewscomments for examplei didnt really like jackie brown or four rooms despite tarantino making themsoits not like im gonna love automatically anywaylet me start1 is nothing like any of tarantinos other films its not all a metaphor and dissection of popculture issues like pulp fictionand its nothing like reservoir dogs either in that it simply doesnt feel the same butthis doesnt mean that isnt in tarantinos style tarantino has shots in his mind that no one else could imaginecertaintly not in these circumstances he thinks original thoughts that belong so much to him that this film creates a genre unto itself even tho its conceived of both eastern japanese and western westerns influences2 it is violent this is not one to take youre wife to nowim not sexistbutbetween the two showings that i saw of it 26 people left13 couples you could hear wives yelling at husbands to give them the keys so they could leavewhy would you even want to watch this theyd say soyeahits violent and its not like in pulp fiction where you dont see the violence here you see it in all its bloody gore people get killed with a sword in just about every imaginable way im trying to think of a way that people dont get killed with a sword in the filmbut i cant think of one the violence is realisticeven though it is totally exaggerated and overthetop3 when people are cut except for the lead actors they bleed in geysers nowim not talking like geysers of blood that you see in war films like saving private ryan and platoonim taking 10 foot high geyserslike when a fire hydrant breaks im seriousat one point in the filmthere are like 7 guys all fighting with only one arm and the other are is cut off and is replaced by a huge stream of blood shooting out horizontally from the body it is bloody people are tortured people are raped people are cut into pieces we see exposed brainswe see eyes getting cut out of heads all before your eyesor at least seemingly nowwith all those geysers of bloodyou may think its a farceor a jokewelli dont blame youmany people in the theatre did4 you have to understand what tarantino is trying to do and where he got all these ideas from you should know that this film is the child of many japanese films i would urge you to watch somebecause it would help you to appreciate what this film is tarantino doesnt want you to love killinghe doesnt want you to go out and copy his portrayed actions he wants you to realize realize what our mentality isrealize what is going on around usthis isnt an entertaining film as much as it is a documentary about how violent the world is today5 it is very good that it is in two partsone three hour plus film would get tiringit would test your enduranceand thats not what this film is about you would agree if you saw itand its not like the matrix or terminator where you feel like your just gonna see more of the same in the next onei meanyou know that in the next matrix neo is gonna fight smith againi meanyou know whats gonna happenyou may not know the end of the plotbut you know the route to get there in this film youre not really dying to see the next oneyou almost appreciate the wait so you can absorb this one6 there are no boring parts everything hits you the way it should if you should laughthen you doif you should crythen you do i almost didthere is a very sad part in vol1if you should cringethenwellyou do over and over again this is is all about the awwwghthat sigh of digust in seeing something you wish you hadntlike seeing your parents nakedor opening the garbage can and seeing a dead animal insidewhat do you sayawwwwwghgh7 one mistake i foundwhen oren ishii is being introduced not in anime but when she is sitting at the table with all the members of the gang counciljust before she cuts that guys head offwe are introduced to go gothe chick with the ball and chainshe is introduced as the girl to the right of o ren isbutgo go is sitting to o rens left it is a mistakebecause when we look at the screenshe is on the right side of the screenbutnot on orens right maybe theres significance to thatbuti cant figure it outsothe movie is basically perfect everything about it is awesome some people wont be able to take itbutits violence is an antiviolence statementjust like pulp fiction was an anticrimeunderground worldkillingdrug filmsoif you like tarantinogo see the filmdont take your girlfriendunless she can really take violencecause walking out of a tarantino flick that your so excited about really sucksbrandon,cruel
its been awhile since i really thoroughly enjoyed a movie the original matrix gattaca aliens all had me leaving the theatre in that heady euphoric state that a really good flick can put you in well put me there and then some it is like nothing that weve seen lately and breaks most of the conventions that it honors it hits all the right notes that jackie brown missed and delivers a strong heady rush on a very visceral level kudos to quentin and uma,cruel
go see this film this movie is a film makers playground i never should have doubted tarantino theres no need to compare it to the matrix or any of those other movies just enjoy it for being as entertaining as it is oh yeah the only thing that would make this movie more enjoyable is if you watch it with a hot chick,cruel
i love tarantinos work  reservoir dogs and pulp fiction are among my favorite movies  even the less popular jackie brown holds a special place in my heart  however i had begun to worry that maybe the quentin train was starting to lose a little steam  when i bought my ticket and sat down in the theater i had no idea what i was in store forvol 1 is barnone the best movie this year  it has all the action of a supermegaactionhit with the underlying subplot that weve all come to expect and love from tarantino  though some of the deaths in this movie are a tad unbelievable they can swiftly be shelved in return for the intensity between the charactersif you see one movie this year make sure its vol 1,cruel
eleven years ago a young man named quentin tarantino released his first film reservoir dogs it became a huge hit and two years later he released pulp fiction in 1997 he made his least acclaimed film jackie brown the long six year wait is over volume one has been released into theaters with a great reception and possible more violence than pulp fiction although i dont know much about the man i can guess that tarantino is not a modern hollywood director as he was working on he didnt allow squibs to squirt fake blood and he doesnt cast the most famous hollywood stars knowing this i was surprised that he allowed miramax to split this movie up into two parts in order to get twice the revenue of course if this movie hadnt been split into two it probably would have been nc17uma thurman isnt a name that rolls off of the tongue nor is it the first name you think of when you hear the word actress thats where tarantinos work comes in having worked with her in pulp fiction he knows her any mainstream actress would have not accepted for it is too hard of a part to be a martial arts star thurman was perfect for her role as the bride shes an assassin who has been in a coma for four years brought there by the title character bill david carradine and others including oren ishii lucy liu elle driver daryl hannah and vernita green vivica a fox she simply wants vengeance for not only did they nearly kill her but they also killed her unborn babyput simply is the most entertaining movie of the year its not light and breezy but its never boring and really keeps a smile on your face for most of the time tarantino goes from quick thrills to a heavyhanded sequence in the middle of the film but the transition is smooth which makes it bearable the fight scenes were amazing uma thurman doesnt look like someone you would normally equate with action star and thats what makes her even better in her role she plays it was fierceness and the right approach she had the discipline to learn the complicated moves for all of her fights they werent wannabe kungfu fights like in the matrix but real ones there were barely any special effects for them and they looked spectacularof course where would tarantino be without controversy the violence is much debated about mainly for the cause of the two parts many including me say that the main reason that was split into two separate movies was to keep the mpaa rating for both as an r instead of one nc17 movie the violence was gratuitous and extreme constant throughout the movie but it didnt seem real in the least ive seen much of the same in the grand theft auto video games all of the blood did look real however and made me believe that it was actual bloodthe cinematography by robert richardson is spectacular he tries a variety of styles quick mtvstyle cuts long three minutes takes and views from every conceivable angle and some inconceivable ones another factor i loved about was how it tried and successfully recaptured the cheesiness of the 70s action movies tarantino wanted to make this movie like although those movies didnt shift around time like tarantino does here it had a low budget feel to it like in the opening before and during the credits and a plain feeling to itthere were only two things i didnt like about first was how cheaply tarantino tried to tone down the violence in a few scenes by either making the fight in blackandwhite or just having the silhouettes fight the other was the ending i wanted to go on longer i enjoyed it so much it left with such a cliffhanger ending which revealed something shocking about the bride who in 100 minutes and is actually a despicable person i grew to like as a character other than that if you can stomach it go out right now to see my rating 910rated r for strong bloody violence language and some sexual content,cruel
this could be the best movie to come out in a long time  it is the type of movie that we need  though excessively violent it is not put there for shock but rather to pay respect to the movies that came before it  anyone that claims his other movies were to violent will most likely hate this oneit is the perfect breed of comedy and action  quentin explores many genres in this movie but i dont want to spoil it so ill just say the history of lucy lius character oren ishi is spectacular i like quentins approach to this movie i like the acting and i like the plot i recommend it to anyone that can stomach blood a lot of blood,cruel
is crazy energetic fun insane so i highly reccomend it the music is wonderful and appropriate at all times  the opening credit sequence is hypnotising as well as flashbacks i cant wait till vol 2,cruel
this movie is so awesome its a true guys movie it has cartoonish qualities ie all the crazy squirting blood and enough violence to get the good ol testosterone flowing the fight seens we surprisingly good and uma even did her own stunts making it that much better the story line isnt to complicated and you can forsee some swists later on im actually glad they broke this up into more than one movie because it makes more room to elaborate on everything and especially more fight screen which are hope are going to get even better as it goes on,cruel
i usually dont comment on movies on imdb but i just got back from seeing volume 1 and it is so good that i have to commenti loved everything about this movie from beginning to end or middle p the dialogue was perfect everything worked nothing corny the different styles used in the movie were all awesome from the black  white scenes shadow fight scene the anime sequence wasnt sure how id feel about an anime scene in a liveaction movie but it was perfectthe fight scenes amazing awesome incredible nah not any of those 3 words can describe it we need to come up with a new word to describe the fight scenes in this movie the fight with the crazy 88s towards the end was the most incredible thing ive ever seen in my life so much blood if youre queasy you might not enjoy this but the movie is so good id still suggest you see it anywaythe soundtrack was excellent quentin really knows how to use music in movies i love the soundtrack to all his films and as usual every song in this movie fits perfectly with the scenethis is definitely my favorite tarantino movie and its only volume 1i seriously cannot wait until february for volume 2 oh and did i mention how awesome the fight scenes are,cruel
just saw it and was i ever pleased tarantinos hiatus has left all his fans yearning for another blistering flick from the cinematic genius he returns with vol 1 he returns with stylethe performances are all over the top but this kind of tongueincheek moviemaking calls for that kind of behavior uma thurman is sensational as well as lucy liu vivica a fox doesnt have much time to develop so her performance cant be lauded too much daryl hannah is promising with more to come michael madsen is almost nonexistent however as with daryl hannah he has more to come david carradine has yet to show his face but comes off riveting as the title characterthe scenes move quickly and the flow of the movie is uneven the movie really shines for its style and little bells and whistles there is a great amount of detail and the nods to martial arts culture such as the music the formats used theres even anime the costumes and the characters themselves are very enjoyablein the opinion of this viewer tarantino who is known for his great dialogue has abandoned cleverness and gone more for emotion and inyourface action this film isnt very talkative and when characters are talking it isnt engaging dialogue you dont have fun with it the dialogue is always building up to something and you almost always know what it is the film is very straightforward the flashbacks are a kick giving further insight into the charactersthis isnt totally important to talk about but it still is a major part of the film violence i mean some serious violence this is one the bloodiest films i have ever seen and thats saying a lot some of the deaths are appalling and for that tarantino needs to be praised when you go over the top with a film you have to go all out one of the characters has an accident ala the movie hannibal that has to be seen to believe innumerable limbs and oceans of blood are lost its great this isnt a movie to take terribly seriously you re just supposed to have fun with it the way tarantino probably did making itlast but not least twists this film starts with a twist cut off by a bang i think most who saw the movie knew what uma thurman was about to say before she got that bullet in her head which obviously didnt kill her but only made her more angry the bullet was courtesy of bill as mentioned in the trailers so im not giving anything away he has a nice twist of his own which serves as the last line to vol 1 leaving it in a cliffhangerwhere vol 2 will go its hard to say if it is anything like vol 1 which i imagine it will be then most are in for a real treat is a great movie experience with tarantino at the wheel enjoy,cruel
i was entranced with tarantino the first time i saw reservoir dogs and that movie is one of my 5 or 10 favorite movies then pulp fiction showed everyone else what kind of movie maker this guy is jackie brown was fine but nothing specialin true romance which tarantino scripted the lead character praises a big movie guy about his movies being movies and is exactly that its a movieits cool its style its kinetic its a great achievement of film of a movie maker at the top of his gamevery few movies actually reach a level of going beyond the typical style of a movie and thats what tarantino can create he creates a universe a world where anything he puts up on screen worksthis is easily the best movie of 2003,cruel
theres something almost hypnotic about a screen face full of uma thurman staring directly at us and demanding wiggle your big toe she says this so much it starts to dawn on me that maybe shes speaking in code or perhaps i then realized shes so convincing in this one scenethat she could be spouting any mundane detail and i would think she is whispering the secrets of her life truth be tolda life was almost what she didnt have we know her only as the bride  a young women whos whole purpose is to take aim and revenge at the very people who killed her daughter and laid her in a comatose state for 4 years the film opens with just what the film trailers promise revenge this film is so raw obtuse and prurient that i started to love it  slaysgutsbeheadsshredskickscracks and amputates everything that comes on frame in fact sword use was so often used that when i generally here gunfire from filmi hardly flinchlet alone notice taranatino made me jump twice this film follows all the formulas of kung fu films of the 70s and spaghetti westerns of the 60s that quentin even has a cute homage of feature presentation at the start he acknowledges his own work and even continues his small micro cosmic universe that he created years ago we see resevoir dogs get a chinese influencered apples cigarettes and uma winking at mrs mia wallace the film is brilliant and an experiment in squibs that i now understand the reason for 2 volumesdue in february who could possibly sit through 3 hours of this film and not become aghast a marketing ploy this is not he realized the power of his own creation he realized the energy of it he knew a break for the audience was needed surely he was right making this into more of an epic would hurt the timing and pace its storytelling is choppy and unpolished we remember very little of dialouge  that we usually get from quentin there is no dead nigger storage it would be to hap hazard to recommend this film for fan boys as they are not interested in knowing if this film is good or not there mind was made up months ago was a blood thirsty treat bag and it reminded me of the first time i saw the wild bunch that too was frightenly brash that i had to watch it again and again good films do that i think im going to ,cruel
wow this film packed a wallop while it had some little flaws weapons allowed on planes how do passports and cash simply materialize when necessary etc the action is truly great and the filming of the action was clear enough to follow unlike the trend nowadays to splice so quickly you cant even tell whats going on it is way up there with the goriest movies ive ever seen im trying to think of similar gore levels in movies that are not just all about splatterbraveheart maybe im thinking of that cause that film had such visceral sound effects like some of the ones in but man the blood does fly and so do body parts in this and i cant imagine anyone disappointed by the levels of gore artistic gore clever and new gore but aside from that aspect of the film is a great throughline of intent the bride is so strong and focusedyou figure shell get out of vol 1 just fine cause theres vol 2 but still its exciting to see how she does it and yeah i want to know the back story  when the cliffhanger came at the end i really wished vol 2 was spooled and ready to go i would have sat another 2 hours right then i cant wait for more as for the boycott trend come on did any of us boycott empire strikes back cause we felt gypped that star wars continued on how about matrix fans obligingly ready for 3rds even after crappy 2nds followed a good 1st get off the 10 high horse and see 2 parts of a good movie and forego paying for some crap movies you know will suck if thats what it takes hell i went to a matinee today which was 5 if you want to see badly enough you will and you should,cruel
spoilers below proceed at your own riskok that was definitely the best movie of the year truly a magnificent work just one warning this movie has blood lots and lots of blood fountains of blood if you dont like fake blood dont see this movienow on to the review as you all know uma thurmans character whose real name we dont know because qt bleeps it over was attacked on her wedding day in the chapel they kill her fiance husband and as we assume her daughter at the end of the movie bill says that shes alive four years later the bride uma thurman  wakes up kills the guy medical assistant whos been pimping her comatose body for all those years my name is buck and im here to  fckyes thats a line from the movie then she takes his truckthe pussy wagon and goes off but before that as she is lying on the back seat of his truck trying to regain control of her legs we see the lfe story of oren ishii lucy liu told in anime anime lovers rejoice while im no expert on anime i liked itthen of course she kills two of the atrackers lucy liu and vivica a fox in a dazzling array of martial arts and of course since this is tarrantino the second movie takes place earlier than the firstwhile im going to spend most of the time on the first murder the one you see in the trailer the second one was awesome basically she breaks into vernita greens vivica a fox house and they trash the living room fighting then however her four year old daughter comes home and they delay the fight since the bride doesnt want to kill her enemy in front of her daughter they go into the kitchen and as she i preparing cereal for her daughter green tries to shoot the bride and thurman kills her then however we see her daughter standing in the doorway seeing the whole thing as she leaves the bride says when you grow up if you still feel bad about this thing then ill be waiting shockok the second murder is what is what most of the movie is about its hard to describe you have to see it but basically it involves fights between the bride vs 17 yr old japanese schoolgirl the bride vs the crazy 88 thats the scene you see in the trailer by the end of which the floor of the nightclub is covered in bodies and of course the bride vs oren ishii great stuffnow there is also a scene where this okinawan guy makes her a sword while i know that the actor who plays this guy is some kind of martial arts movie legend i dont know anything about itanyways this was a great movie and i truly think this is the est movie of the year  thats out of 5 in case you dont know,cruel
this is a freakin masterpieceok its gonna be a little harsh a little rude and very bloodybut i digress i have been watching the akira kurosawa collection lately and here we have uma thurman in a role reminiscent of toshiro mifune  and id even guess that part of this film may be an homage to akirabut id say this flick is better than anything ive seen from ak i was blown awayok so there isnt much plot there is a lot of blood and even some cartoons er anime the acting the scenery the visuals the direction  amazing imho way better than crouching tiger hidden dragoncant wait for volume 2  more anticipation for this than matrix revolutions or the lotr already know the story therewhen i walked out of the theater i was filled with emotion  that happens to me when i witness people at the top of their craft4 stars,cruel
number one i like this movie very much  after the tired explosions and blah direction of this summers blockbusters this is a breath of brisk autumn air  i gave it 8 of 10  little plot great action wonderful lookingnow does this mean it should be seen by everybody in the r realm absolutely not  this is a tough brutal film to watch  to quote david strutt in a previous review here this is fight pornmany others here will tell you how great this movie is viscerally  blood as paint perhaps  i just feel the need to add how brutally nonstop the graphic violence is  the body and limb count is extraordinaryso my question is if this wasnt quentin tarentino would this have been released in its current incarnation with an r rating  if so this is the most violent film ive ever seen with such a rating  i dont see how this is even in the same ballpark or planet as woody allens anything else which was also graced with an rmaybe its time for an r17 rating since nc17 seems to be taboo  if we are going to have ratings at all use them as they should be used should be nc17 period,cruel
tarantino has made a gem with  it is a beautiful piece of formalistic cinema never with a dull moment  uma thurman shines in more way than one as the protagonist of the film and each character is as interesting as the next  the colors and abstract camera angles multiple use of the birds eye angle keep your eyes glued to the screen and the original music made by the rza and other music complements the film with perfection  dont be fooled by the preview or the titlethis film is absolutely incredible to watch and maybe even better to listen to the sound design with the music is incredible,cruel
goddamn if isnt better than anything else you could see wow an amazing film  if you thought that crouching tiger hidden dragon set the bar for girlongirl fights then raises it  uma thurman as the bride is sensational  lucy liu as oren is spectacular  need i continue  honestly this is the kind of film that if you werent already interested in youre not gonna like later  it is an ultraviolent tribute to japanese chopsocky films masterfully done by quentin tarantino  its only half a moviebut twice as good as any movie deserves to be  and no its not quite pulp fictionnot yet but what is  qt after what some feel was a misfire with jackie brown  hits the bullseye and cements his position as one of the best directors of his time,cruel
i was lucky enough to experience quentin tarantinos new kungfuesque film vol i on opening day  what a rush  to quote trainspotting take the best orgasm youve ever had and multiply it by a thousand and it still doesnt come closethe music which is always a key aspect in quentins films was dead on the cinematography was beyond belief  acting was superb especially uma she came out like a rocket  the humor is the epitome of comedic excellence with jokes you wouldnt expect from a kungfu flick and others you wouldlike the spewing lawn sprinklerlike blood effects  pussy wagon haha  the action sequences rival all bruce lee jackie chan and jet li films put together  just all around awesome  plus the ending leaves you begging for moredespite its excellence its hard to believe that this received an r rating for a clearly worthy nc17  the blood the severed limbs  although there was a lack of the recognizable tarantino vulgaritythat i personally love the gore covers the swearings groundstill vol i takes the cake for the best film so far this year quite possibly one of the best of the decade and puts tarantino back on the tongues of moviegoers of all sorts,cruel
this movie is without a doubt quentin tarantinos best creation yet it is fastpaced beautifully filmed funny and extremely violent all the things a good movie should be i liked it better than pulp fiction and i think that most people will too its more controlled as far as direction and writing go and it shows a level of finesse that quentin hasnt shown before the editing is amazing and so is umasee it love it910,cruel
i am thoroughly impressed with tarantinos growth as a writer and director and liked his homage to the martial arts genre  the anime was a nice added touch  my only complaint is having to wait until february to see volume 2 this movie is by far tarantinos finest,cruel
rush out and see this movie  lucy was great hot as ever  the rzas music was as great as his music in ghost dog  uma was wonderful as well  when the movie ended i wished i could see the second vol immediatly it did not feel like i had been there more than five minutes it felt like two hours sitting through the previews however  go see this,cruel
quentin tarantino is one of the most interesting and capable writers of todays industry he is able to write scenes of pure dialog completely omitting camera changes or actor blocking and not lose the interest of the viewer as we see in he is also able to direct scenes of almost complete stillness without losing momentum there is something in japanese belief that places an equal importance on negatives as on positives the art of sushi perfectly illustrates this in the balance of the food and the empty dish similarly there is much stillness in the balance lies in the stillness or humanity of the characters and their acts of inhuman violence tarantino seems to have created a verynearlyperfect balance of vengeance and humanity and of comedy and drama this is not to say that tarantino has created a verynearlyperfect film it has its flaws and the viewer must remember not to take the film too seriously however the film was paced choreographed and in all other respects directed with the finesse of an artistic master it is not the film but tarantino that must be taken seriously was undoubtedly the bloodiest film i have ever seen just as in old kung fu films the body count for a twominute film clip would easily reach double digits in many minds the graphic violence will be the most memorable aspect of the film which is unfortunate tarantinos sense of humor is evident in the film as is his selfconfidence it was a thrill ride from beginning to end an unregrettable pleasure this film is far from a common pleaser  it is not for everyone as a great enjoyer and admirer of tarantinos works i had great expectations and was not disappointed in the least if you enjoyed his previous films you cant go wrong with this one if we can expect to see the same style and flow in the second volume then i will gladly pay twice to see the whole story february cant come too quickly,cruel
wow if you are a tarantino fan you will love this movie  all the quirky little things that have made tarantino a favorite writer and director are present in force in this film  however be warned this movie is not for the faint of heart  it is a hundred times bloodier than reservoir dogs and pulp fiction combined  within the first 45 minutes of the show about 15 people had left the film  i have never before seen a more graphic and violent film however i loved almost every minute of it  needless to say this movie is not for children and should have been rated nc17,cruel
the minute you bought your ticket you were in another worldmy name is sara and i saw vol 1 on 101003 opening dayi went into the theatre knowing it was going to be brilliant but i never expected it to be my fav and best theatre experience in yearsit opens brilliantly in pure tarantino fashion along with a surreal overtone of just the right music and care from that point on youre in for the cinematic wonder of the year especially if you love tarantino each frame was handled with such delicacy you could honestly tell that tarantino took such precise and heartfelt steps into every little detail like a spider making its webwhen i walked out of the theatre i was shaking teary eyed and mesmerized with this overwhelming sensation of the wonderful and pure feel of filmi would say a lot more but sometimes its just better to experience it yourself instead of reading the damn reviews if you have any sort of appreciation for film then go see this movie asap10 outta 10 definitely,cruel
at the end of his career renegade and brilliant director quentin tarantino will be known from movie critics and fans for two movies reservoir dogs and pulp fiction the first being his indiecult classic that paved the way for his distinct vivid storytelling ability the second being his rise to commercial stardom with an ensemble cast perhaps second to noneit revived the career of former icon john travolta introduced uma thurman to the big stage and also reminded us of the brilliance of numerous actors bruce willis harvey keitel tim roth ving rhames and eric stoltz are just a few oh and that samuel l jackson well he just went out and stole the movie with an unforgettable performance as everyones favorite character jules winnfield that bad motheryou know the restthis previous paragraph would be undeniable for almost any true movie critic and fan sure there was jackie brown a very enjoyable and wellacted movie that most tarantino fans hold very dear to their heart but it never hit mainstream like some thought it never really caught on as one of tarantinos true classicsthat all changed on october 10th 2003 when uma thurman was going to the preview had an auspiscious debut late last winter with a few cheesy promo clips showing uma thurman with quite a large sword not that type of movie and surrounded by several martial artists in business suits and shakesperian masks huhalmost a year later and volume 1 of finally arrived and while volume 2 is still 5 months away waiting for february to arrive will not only be added to tarantinos impressive lineup but it will stand with reservoir dogs  pulp fiction as true classics from the mind of the most innovative storyteller to direct in the past 15 years sofia copolla is well on her way but she is no tarantino as of yetfilm highlights i dont want to ruin the fun uma is absolutely brilliant though and looks more beautiful than ever tarantino once again tells us this story through his usual unorganized yet perfect method we are introduced to each character their story and their relation to umas character abtly titled the bride vivica fox helps the movie get off to a strong start as villainess 1 and while we are teased with a sexyreturn by daryl hannah lucy lui then bursts out onto the scene with beauty and actinggrace with the beautiful yet completely deadly oren ishi michael madsens budd is foreshadowed and we even get a peak at the infamous billany more details outside of some amazing fight scenes squirting limbs dumping out thousands of gallons of blood an amazing battle pitting thurman against countless of the afforemention welldressed martial artists and as usual a perfect soundtrack headed up by wutang clans true genius the rzathis leaves volume 1 as an amazing movie to watch and enjoyjust save the popcorn for the next lessbloodied and limblosing movie i thank tarantino for this amazing movie and the best way i can think to outside of this review is by seeing volume 2 i recommend you do the same,cruel
uma thurman rocks as a female assassin who has vengeance on her mind and a japanese sword in her hand  the worst thing i can say about this movie is that it is not the end of the story  arrggh  january 2004 seems a long way away,cruel
vol1 is a revenge story pure and simple there are no gimmicky subplots no characters that are not fully developed it is a cut and dry film that leaves you craving for so much moreuma thurman was absolutely fabulous in her roll as the bride she was perfect for the roll and boy can she kick some tailshe is left for dead on her wedding day by a group of assasians and becomes comatose after the incidentshe wakes up hunts down the death list five and thats your storytarentino never fails to put out something remarkable and this left me in awe it had to have been a tough decision for the studio to break this down in two because you do sorta feel screwed at the endbut none the less a really cool film with tons of blood and one of the most gorgeous heroines to ever grace the screenand from the looks of the way the story went volume 2 will be betterbrew,cruel
only quinton can deliver and action homage to karate movies flick thats gory with realistic fight scene as close as movie reality can be a sadistic heroine driven to to kill the persons responsible for destroying her life and yet provide sarcastic dialog that adds levity to barbaric situations while making it entertaining the cinematic elements were just as amazing blending black  white footage animation anime old camera techniques with the new coupled with his vision of what he wanted the audience to see the music beds  sonic bites were directed well also the icing to his cake i loved the scenes with v fox  when we 1st me lucy lui at her celebration lastly uma was great she really pulled it off forgive me but it was one of the most intelligent fight movies ive seen well crafted,cruel
provides a variety of kung fu like sequences in a simple but clear plot with strong influence from chinese and japanese films uma thurman in her yellow jumpsuit reminiscent of bruce lee is absolutely fantastic in portraying the sweet motherly figure  with a tough tough edge dont mess with this girli really liked the way that the graphically violent scenes are almost reduced to a comical hilarious joke  some of the scenes are serious but some are downright funny the brief switch to manga style sequences in the film is particularly effective at portraying the anger and lust for revenge felt by most protagonists in the filmthe mellow background music and peaceful atmosphere surrounding the gory battle scenes  which are very unlike the overmystified crap being shown in some recent movies  is quite reminiscent of the way clockwork orange had used music to intensify the violence shown onscreenthe major thing i strongly did not like in this film was the fact that it was split into two parts i believe that with some proper editing the film could have been released as a long feature in one part i believe that the abrupt cut in the middle of the story is quite frustrating to viewers and leaves you with the feeling that the whole business of film sequels is being carried a bit too far lately films should not be like tv serials,cruel
tarantino is back after some years with this new movie called i hoped this movie would be a nice fresh wind and come up with something new but it isnt the storyline is very thin this is a boring traditional revenge movie i cant stand the matrix lookalike fighting i think uma is the person that saved this movie from a total disaster she is doing a great job i fall in sleep the first half hour i can compare this movie with an average jackie chan kung fu movie i hope mr tarantino is putting him self together to the next movie to be honest this movie is maybe worth spending money on cinema 1 time but do not add it to your dvd collection later this movie dont deserve a rate much higher then 70 at this splended imdbcom site,cruel
wow ive never seen a more violent wonderful beautiful movie in all my life this is the popcorn flick for the ages  im somewhat biased though im in love with swords and samurai flicks and have been all my life it seems  akira kurosawa is the angel of film with his masterful collection of samurai flicks like sanjuro and the hidden fortress i looove samurai flicks i first heard about this movie about a year ago and my heart hasnt quit its pounding since the movie was better than i could have ever dreamed the soap opera ending had me gasping and laughing at the sheer lunacy of it all it was beautiful see it see it see it see it 10 out of 10 youll not be disappointed its better than the trailer which is saying quite a bit these days okay thats all 1010 cant wait for vol 2,cruel
im going to try not to gush but the giddy insane intensity of the film might leak into this review  i havent had so much fun at a movie like this since well pulp fiction  though it is slightly draggy in one section this is truly a work of art and it should be viewed as such  tarantino is a master with complex storylines pulp as well as complex ones reservoir  this is a simple revenge thrillercomedy filtered through the warped mind of tarantino until it becomes nothing but a giggleinducing rocket trip to the moon and back tarantino takes such exquisite care with every frame every second until what we are ultimately left with feels very polished and very deliberate which doesnt take away from the intensity for a second  the weird thing is i absolutely abhorr action films and elongated fight sequences  there is such stomachchurning jawdropping originality and humor represented here i felt dizzy when the film came to an end with an excruciating cliffhanger  and by the way mr tarantino thank you for that  i would not have been able to sit still for another hour and 40 minutes  this film made me want to jump out of my seat and cheer more than once  for crying out loud people  the man got me to enjoy a bloody action movie  that is talent  february 20th cannot come soon enough,cruel
actually pulp fiction might be the better filmtm but this wonderful bit of celluloid has a different agenda  pure cinematic adrenaline i saw this on the afternoon of its first days exclusive presentation run at the empire theatre in london i wasnt intending to rush out and see it so soon but hell its the new tarantino isnt it a good move as it goes because this movie seriously rocks and i have no hesitation in recommending it to any fans of the grindhouse genre it celebrates sure its plotless but so are most of the movies i love now come i think about it this like those movies 2001 apocalypse now jaws is concerned with the experience of cinema cgiobsessed studios take note  this is the real deal bravo quenten jackie brown is just a fading memory were all kids again so enjoy,cruel
i went to see volume 1 yesterday afternoon without expecting muchbut after i saw the movie all i could say was wow  now i cant wait until volume 2 is released in 2004the anime turned out to be quite god and i especially liked the way they gave the background history on lucy lius characterthe movie is well worth your money especially if you like martial arts action  as well as anime,cruel
i enjoyed the first hour and a half of this film and then suddenly as the violence escalated i just found myself getting sleepythe films fighting sequences are a near exact copy of those in the xbox games my husband likes to play  with the characters dressed in fighter outfits the player can select the geisha in white the japanese schoolgirl the headtotoe yellow leather jumpsuit the black suit with the eye mask the blood spurting like a fountain out of the cut limbs the large room in which the fight happens  all taken out of the games this makes the fighting the most original youve seen in movies so far but it works for the first hour and a half as i said and then the joke grows staleoh and the film is very selfreferential youll recognize the funny tarantino signatures from the other movies hes made particularly pulp fiction  the square drawn in the air uma thurman waking up out of a coma with a start absurdly silly dialogue coldblooded killers calling each other bunny rabbitbefore this movie started several trailers were shown among them one for the latest leslie nielsen spoof with some really funny references to other movies as usual  well the tarantino film that followed had that feeling of a spoof probably because the plot was pretty irrelevant and i realised tarantino is no longer an original genius hes lost his touch for the original he can now only do derivative stuffwhich is a shame because weve reached the point where nobody can make an action movie any more that is compelling enough for an adult audience,cruel
finally tarantino is back directing his 4th film i must say it was very enjoyable to watch tarantino doesnt fail to make this film enjoyable obviously hes trying to capture the spirit of the old kung fu films and he does a very good job at it but i wouldnt exactly say this film is for everyone one may think its lame and unrealistic with the blood spurting everywhere like a fountain but like i said thats what tarantino is trying to do capture the spirit of old kung fu movies surprisingly uma thurman did a great job in this film i usually dont like her in any movies except pulp fiction and she did really well for this one i rate this movie 9 out of 10 and i reccomend it to either kung fu fans or tarantino fans,cruel
dont put off until next week what you should see today violence be damned this film  not movie is killing made beautiful quentins love for all things cinematic shines through every frame and there is no doubt in my mind that part2 will be even better the origin of orenishii alone is worth the price of admission,cruel
have you ever read a book where you sort of got into it but youre not quite sure if you like it  the story is good enough to keep you interested and yet you know in your heart youve read better  you get to the point where the story begins to pick up a little and then you put it down never to pick it back up again  ive done that so many times i cant fathom how many halfread books i have on my bookshelf  quentin tarantinos pulp fiction new film volume 1 is very much like that  its watch able it somewhat compelling and at the moment it begins to pick up the credits rollstars uma thurman pulp fiction as the bride i prefer to call her bleep cause early in the film they bleep her name out three times and i thought it was kind of funny a women on a quest for revenge  it seems bleep was getting married when a group of really bad dudes crashed the party killing everyone including her unborn baby  that is except for bleep who somehow and against all odd survives and now shes out for bloodshe begins picking off everybody who was involved in the plot to murder her in volume one she meets up with vernita vivica a fox juwanna mann now a housewife with a husband and a child and oren ishi a sexy underworld leader in tokyo  she also makes friends with an old mr myiagi type sonny chiba immortal combat who designs kick ass swords and quotes old eastern proverbs like theyve gone out of fashionto be honest there isnt much to talk about concerning this film  except to say that its pretty violent in a silly stylized way the action scenes are well worth the price of admission and that unlike most movies this one is missing a core story  we never find out who the bride is we dont know why bill played incognito by david carradine god wants to kill bleep and we dont know why  bleep doesnt have a name  its just one action scene after another and were not quite sure whom to root forof the movies that could have been split up into two parts this film is not a prime candidate  1995 gettysburg would have probably faired better in two parts the way its edited now it feels like a pilot for a television series and not a film  im not even quite sure if i liked it or not theres not enough here to make a distinction  i guess it looks really good the action sequences are topnotch and theres an anime sequence that would make a great short by itself  other than that its an action film that is really not about anythingas for the performances the only one that sticks out is lucy liu ballistic ecks vs sever who has an amazing screen presence to begin with  in fact if there is a character in this movie thats worth rooting for its her  but i think thats because shes the only character that the film digs deep into  the aforementioned anime sequence is her backstorycome to think of it volume 1 is like the first two stages of a double dragon type video game  each scene has little guys you need to kill and then a boss  i guess bill will be the final boss lets just hope that hes a hard kill  cause i want volume 2 to lift volume 1 out of the gutterso at this point i reserve judgement either way until volume 2 is released in february  cause right now its on that thin line between a great movie and a mediocre one on its own its only worth the price of admission to action freaks and kung fu enthusiasts  all others would probably do themselves better by waiting to see both movies togetherplease quentin dont let us down out of 5 this could change pending volume 2,cruel
note possible spoilersmy partner and i usually agree on the films weve seen  not on this oneshe loved it  raved about every aspect of it  called it brilliant not a word she uses lightly  said it might be the best film shes seen this yearoddly shes not much of a qt fan  i am and seeing was my ideai was ok with it though not really loving it up until the battle royal in the japanese restaurantnight club  then i almost dozed off if id been there alone id have got up and left  boring saturdaymorningcartoon kiddie stuffyeah the cinematography was good and the music was arresting  but there was no there there and i left the theatre feeling cheated,cruel
when a friend asked what i thought of this film i said it would take some digesting maybe i havent waited quite long enough but offhand same afternoon seen i have to say vol1 is a mild letdown at the very least it feels like the statement of an avowed ardent film and comic nerds boredom with wildly disparate cultural references ricocheting off every solid object in sight the eclectic atmosphere seems to be the point of the enterprise and the directors greatest joy quent is stylin here baby the only thing i can think of close to this may be james coburns 60s flint films the feel here is oddly similarbut sweatedover eclecticism is like sweatedover irony or humor to me it can payoff but when it does it is usually in a naggedfeeling okay i get it already way if you take away the tarantino name what is here fails as experience this is the first tarantino film you can say that about pulp fiction was a standard situational set up and story but in it tarantino juggled chronology in a new way and played with the disparity between what the audience knows vs what the characters caught in the drama know in a truly quantumhitchcock way whatever else you can say that film was an engrossing experience not so this is first and foremost a brandname labelconscious film the distributors must recognize this because they have been pushing the tarantino returns angle in the promotion sorry to say but take that away tell us this film is directed by the bullet proof monk guy or the rambo iii guy or the medallion guy and what you have is a film no one would be uncomfortable calling a messfour of ten stars see it only for the oversold quentins back factor or not at all is my recommendation waiting for quents film after next,cruel
chiaki kuriyama made the biggest impression on me  she is not only cute but deadly her character go go yubari needs her own movie series anyway the rest of the film has its ups and downs  there are a ton of scenes of just the bride talking or just looking at something  the slow points had me almost falling asleep in my very comfortable movie chair  i dont like to compare other films but pulp fiction and jackie brown never let up or got tedious  i enjoyed the look of the film and the music  the my name is buck and im here to fk scene was hilarious  i say check it out its better than most crap being put out nowadays  610 good,cruel
volume 1 2003  d quentin tarantino  uma thurman is great in her role as a vengeful femme fatale in a film thats good if not great pulp fiction was better but vol 1 still has much of the vintage tarantino style that fans devour its fun but uneven and disjointed id just like to take a moment to praise the opening scene of the film its positively brilliant and compellingthe action sequences deliver the goods but perhaps push the credibility factor somewhat i had a tough time accepting that thurman alone could so easily defeat an army of swordwielding asians and i could have done without the cartoon segment other than that the fight scenes were entertaining if bordering on overkill at times in fact as for the controversy surrounding miramaxs decision to split the film into two parts while i did have a good time for 90 plus minutes or so im ultimately glad they did it i for one was ready for intermission time by the end of the picture,cruel
first thing is that im a huge tarantino fan so are a lot of people apparently thats why this film has gotten so much buzz this flick tries to put too many different cliches together and ends up not knowing what its own true nature isthe characters are very nicely cast especially uma she plays her part perfectly the goryness is what in my opinion takes this movie down from what it could be although i like the whole cutting heads and limbs off thing the blood spraying out like a fire hose gets real old real fast and the matrix esqe her against a 100 guys fight scene at the end is a tad overdone i would have liked to see her fighting lucy lui for a lot longer then all that 10 guys at once stuffif you love tarantino films like i do you should like this flick if your not a huge fan then you might be a bit dissapointed those seventies kungfu flicks where cool during the 70s but the whole idea is really old now,cruel
i saw this flick at a sneak preview on tuesday october 7th some background here i love quentin tarantino i loved reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and true romance from dusk til dawn was kind of lame it started out cool but i thought perhaps he and robert rodriguez were sort of screwing around after their new found power next i didnt really like jackie brown and i hated four rooms except for the robert rodriguez segment i became worried he didnt make anything for a long time and i figured since it seemed like true romance and pulp fiction were essentially vicarious cathartic childhood fantasies exercised through film even though i loved them i feared that tarantino had graduated to the lifestyle of the rich famous and creatively dormant its like he didnt have anything to fantasize about anymore because he had enough money to live it for realso then we all hear about this the story line sounded lame some chick goes around dispatching revenge on her enemies for the entire film and i wasnt impressed with the trailers for it looked to me like charlies angels and that scared me  tarantinos movies are close to my heart and i didnt like the last few pieces in his body of work as i stood in line for the movie i had the lowest expectations because i didnt want to be disappointed and although i was really rooting for it too be awesome i felt underneath the movie was not going to be very good i jokingly told my girlfriend be ready because if this movie isnt good there might be a riot up in here when its overso there we were the movie starts and i have knots in my stomach i am looking up at the screen wincing and cringing afraid to laugh wholeheartedly at the first few funny lines the kitchen fight from the trailer plays in full totally different music then what is shown in the preview different pace and rearranged lines better compellingwell timed i begin to breathe a little i fear that i am going to be fooled into liking it for a moment and that suddenly something lame will happen my stomach is tight my nerves are a wreck more of the movie unfolds about one third of the way in my skeptism is being beaten into submissionif you are a fan of tarantino and have yearned for the freshness of reservoir dogs pulp fiction and true romance then i warn you that this movie is so wonderfully perfect so skillfully woven in tarantinos trademark style that some moments you will be close to tears of rejoice this movie is an instant classic i will say to the film buffs who complain tarantino is trying to rip off bruce lees yellow game of death outfit and green hornet mask and various other notables by watching the previews that you will not be disappointed when you see how these elements play out in the film  this movie is like a long lost friend this movie is like finding a diamond in the rough during a drought of long spell of unimpressive movies where audiences are left with the likes of the fast and furious this movie is love at first sighti cant speak for the rest of the audience but everyone seemed to love it as much as me and everyone lingered around until the end of the credits like they wanted to lick the bowl afterward take my word for it if you are old you will feel young again if you are young you will feel like you are watching a part of cinema history vol 1 is so good that i dont even mind waiting around for vol 2 even though that idea still sucks you will see what i mean and though i despise the idea that i will like something that everyone is going to surely love and will be so hyped it will make me sick i cannot deny the kick assityness of this masterpiece,cruel
the film is a masterpiece my favorite of the year tarantino has really outdone himself the film is amazing every scene is something new and unbelieveable the film is style over substance at its most equal point candy is for children this film is visual narcotics its addicting and memsmirzing you are sucked into the intensity and immensity of the magificent masterpiece there are constant homages to the films he loves the fight scenes are near mindblowing as well as hilarious a 17year old japanese girl in a school girl uniform wields a longchained flail in a spectacular battle that will leave hundreds dead they die with gushes of comical blood and join their fellow obstructions wiggling limbless or headless on the bloodred floor uma thurman kicks ass and the films fight scenes top without fx what the matrix did with fx ok i need to stop i am hyping the film way too much just see it if your a qt fan youll enjoy otherwise if your a bergman type guy pass because i do not want to hear your bitching,cruel
quentin tarantinos joy in filmmaking has been apparent from pulp fiction now it shines in colors ballet beauty and focus as never before in uma thurman embodies for him the ideals of grace and intelligence vigor and violence as she vengefully pursues murderers of her child and almost of herself 4 years after being left for dead but awakening from a coma in a very bad moodin an echo of shakespeares supreme ability to focus on a single theme while creating layers of sub plots and themes as for instance in hamlet tarantino has crafted a cornucopia of cinematic styles and genres aiming at one target the broken line of revenge othello describes its path till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them upfrom the titles the director shows a willingness to play with song and genre bad bill is about to shoot his wounded colleague in the head while the director plays nancy sinatras bang bang as macabre and appropriate a choice as i could think of second only to that is the whistle tune darryl hannah is almost dancing to bernard herrmanns twistednerve theme and the violence of this title sequence reminds me of the assassinations in the directors other famously violent flick reservoir dogseveryone by now knows the director is honoring the chinese grindhouse kungfu films of the 70s and the exciting japanese anime films  one of the revenge ballets is in anime style a powerful evocation of a childs outrage at the murder of her father done in the style that transcends cartoon to accentuate the meaning in an almost surreal world anime was made for tarantinoalthough it is tempting to compare with crouching tiger for its martial choreography and the presence of lucy lieu as a villain tarantino goes way beyond tigers lovely violence into a nasty but beautiful world of courage and carelessness camp and cunning  is simply smarter than tiger because it focuses on the textures of revenge enlisting our sympathy for uma the assassination machine while explicating the inevitability of the revenge drivedoes matrix apply here no because matrix confounds with an artificial complexity never loses sight of its theme it just pleases the audiences with the multiple cinematic ways to express it at the beginning of a fight sequence lieu says to enemy thurman you didnt think it was gonna be that easy did you to which thurman replies you know for a second there yeah i kinda did it is easy to like this movie,cruel
samuraispaghetti westerncharlies angelshong kong fui with a lot of spraying blood decapitations dearmitations defootitations detongueitations but no defenestrations and of course a lot of laughs oh and one shot that reminded me of the end of the battle of atlanta scene from gwtw and at one point i thought the ghost of toshiro mifune was in the theaterthe spaghetti western soundtrack punctuated with familiar copshow themes from the past was a hootgo see,cruel
yes its got a b movie plotline yes it pays homage to everything from shaw brothers kung fu flicks to spaghetti westerns to kurosawa to every exploitation movie ever made it even has a japanese anime sequence and yes i realize that as ive described it volume one seems pretty unoriginal but mark my words its like nothing youve ever seen nothing i also realize that from the trailers the movie looks kinda silly and it is but theres something going on beneath the surface that i cant quite put my finger on ive only seen it once four days before offiicial release at a press screening so im not quite sure what that thing is yet rest assured ill see it a few more times before its all said and done however i think much of it has to do with the performances uma thurman just plain blew me away much will be said about how physical a performance this is and thats true but thats not what impressed me the most what really got me was the raw emotion she brought to the role in a film where many implausable things are taking place she grounds us in a stark reality and what about that luci lu after aly mcbeal the charlies angels movies and ecks vs sever i had all but permanently stricken mrs lu from my cool book well she is absolute dynamite in this film shes frightening funny sly and even sympathetic much will also be said about the films violence and yes its gleefuly violent cartoonishly violent ironicly enough the least cartoonish violence in the film is in fact a cartoon i defy anyone to not be disturbed by the amime sequence but after a day or two youll start thinking about that opening sequence nothing funny about that then youll rethink the house of blue leaves segment yeah its funny but theres something about it thats just unsettling ive tried to claim that this movie might be serious when actually im still not sure but ive thought about it constantly for the past three days so there must be something deeper going on then again maybe not either way kudos to mr tarantino for yet again making a movie for an audience of one and getting away with it hes 4 for 4 in my book,cruel
last night i saw the greatest movie i have ever seen in my entire life this movie did everything i wanted it do and then showed me what i had no idea i wanted to see quentin tarantino made the movie that i always wanted to make and did the same stuff i have dreamed to put into a movie for this i hate him because he made my movie and it looks awesome that being said hes created an awesome satire on the traditional action movie with his combination and use of setting and story tellingtarantino uses alot of signature moves in his 4th film for example starting the movie en medius res and detailing each point before backing up or moving on to the next the score which i belive is orginal has an offbeat 70s feel to it with some very classic chords that could have been taken right out of a bruce lee moviealthough at times it is a bit jumpy when it comes to the plot the movie isnt really made for the plot here the plot is very well summed up in the title and really says it all the visiual effects and use of multiple locations makes this a movie that could make tarantino the icon of the 00s action movie making,cruel
spoiler alert our heroine uma thurman the bride  the black mamba once a member of a group of international female assassins quits the group after becoming pregnant  she is about to be married when her boss bill david carradine and the other assassins turn against her and kill everyone at the wedding  they leave her for dead with a bullet in her head  she survives and awakens from a coma after four years and the only thing on her mind is revenge  she strikes out to kill all the female assassins leaving bill for last  if you like a lot of killing you will like this movie because about 50 people were killed most of them by thurman with a samurai sword  the fight scenes in japan are over the top because they show arms legs and heads flying and bodies squirting blood like hoses  the film usually went to black  white when the killing began  thurman is one killing machine and the knife fight with vivica fox copperhead and sword fight with lucy liu cottonmouth were very well choreographed the film ends like a soap opera letting the audience know that someone else at the wedding survived and that she has three more names on her death list it was better the second time i saw it   volume two comes out in february   rated r,cruel
i saw with two of the biggest film critics in america two weeks before it will come out sitting alone in a small 20 person theater and watching tarintinos triumphant comeback was thrilling to say the least watching it a second time at a 400 person promoscreening two days before its national release was even better i knew every time when the bloodcrazed audience was going to go nuts i knew which scenes there was going to be an explosion of applause and i know that the rest of the world is going to like this movie now i said like not lovethere is nothing not to like tarintinos vision of an hommage to 70s b kungfu chopsockey flicks is nothing short of genius but you must understand b movies are not good this movie is not good but thats what makes it great if that makes any sense its a typical revengedriven youkilledeveryoneilovenowiwillkillyou plot seen it a million times on any tnt or tnn made for tv movie however there is so much trademark tarintinoian style and careful crafting of  this bad b movie that it turns out wonderfully from the outdated flashzoom pans to the cheesy sound effects to the laughable dialogue make no doubts about it this is the bestworst movie of the year and what a cliffhanger at the end ive seen the movie twice before it was released and now ill probably pay two more times to see it in the theaters againand yes uma is hot,cruel
im a big tarantino fan though clearly not as good as pulp fiction or resevoir dogs i genuinely enjoyed jackie brown and since blessed with the opportunity to watch volume one before its theatrical release and being one of the first to vote for it on imdb i feel obliged to offer the following advice to all those who have bothered to look up this movie on this web site buy your tickets in advance and see it on the day it opens is tarantino at his finest  intelligently irreverent and violently entertaining i would love to describe the opening scene but i wouldnt want to spoil it for any prospective audience member it cant be described  it must be experienced its absolutely hystericalis a salute to the spaghetti western and cheesy kungfu film as only tarantino can deliver it the village voice described as one of the most violent films in the history of american cinema but i would strongly disagree i have a hard time stomaching extreme violence  odd for a tarantino fan i realize i turned my head whenever unnamed character gets his head blown off while riding in the car in unnamed tarantino film the violence in is purposely excessive its like what you would expect from an rrated cartoon is the only film in which i have laughed uproariously after watching someone get their head chopped offon a scale of 1 to 10 i give a teninfo left out to avoid spoiling it for anyone out there who is totally new to tarantino,cruel
i saw a sneak preview of this on monday night and really liked it very violent and action packed some of the most intense fight scenes i ve ever seen the blood flows in this movie like niagara falls it doesnt have the quotable witty dialog that that the other tarantino films have but it is replaced by action the song bang  bang done by nancy sinatra over the opening credits is perfect and relays the sadness in this movie everybody talks about how tarantino copies other films but this is like no movie ive ever seen of course this film is not for everybody and you will either love it or hate it,cruel
after 6 long years writerdirector quentin tarantino has emerged from shadows with his new kickass kungfu spaghetti western blockbuster vol 1 from the opening scene to the last sentence the first installment of this new film has you holding on to your seat and gasping for air i had the privilege of attending the uk premiere at the empire theatre leicester square london in the presence of quentin tarantino that experience in itself was pretty amazing and he also got up and gave a little informative speech on the film which will no doubt be submitted to the ultracool hall of fame it left me salivating for vol 2 and if you cant wait until the movie lands in theatres on oct17 i suggest that you not walk but run to your local record store and purchase the killer soundtrack,cruel
spoiler alert its quite apparent from volume one that quentin tarantino has not lost any of his love for pulp fiction  from the opening black and white sequence of uma thurman to the final almost touching final fight scene with lucy liu has the makings of an epic cult film  i say cult film because im sure the movie will polarize audiences tarantino takes some big risks with his film genre bending and mixing most of them pay offthe action sequences that were talked about are actually not as sustained as rumoured in fact it really shows a sign of maturity in tarantino that the action takes breaks so the audience can take a breath before the characters start in on each other again  it makes the characters more human too since even those in the best shape could not withstand these constant pounding without taking a short breatherthe story  its a revenge plot plain and simple and as pulpy as those get  plus the actors are all quite up to that task  they all go about chewing up the scenery which fits quite nicely into the film as its set up  its good to see thurman again here she takes the lead as the bride with much vigor and attitude because the bride is ped  her old assassin team has killed her entire wedding party and even tried to kill her but didnt quite finish the job  now she wants to get evenand its great fun  with over the top fight scenes with heads and limbs flying to bodies squirting blood like hoses tarantino is wearing his cheesy gore film influences on his sleeve  there are several film genres here and the best is the back story on lucy lius character when the film switches to japanese anime to set up the audience for the second half of the film which takes place in japan  the dialogue is more classy in this half of the film only between thurman and liu  instead of using the fword as tarantino is want to do in his films they shoot more witty barbs at each other as if there was once great respect between them  this sets up a scene at the end of their fight that is actually touching and makes the bride human instead of just a killing machineof course the film ends with a cliff hanger because miramax didnt want to release a 3 hour plus film however with some creative editing it ends nicely and sets up for volume two  it gives hints about the brides husband the baby she was carrying how she was found after going into hiding and her relationship with bill to name a few things  all of which are very soap opera but a soap that is very stylized and willing to take chances  none of this would have worked had it not been for tarantino being self aware he was just making a big piece of entertaining fluff  in other hands it would have just been another overwrought pile of junk  and even if miramax cut it in two its nice to know that they have allowed out a film that tries to push the envelope,cruel
its hard to believe that a tarantino film with so many beautiful women so much violence blood swearing could be so very very boringas if genuine camp was in short supply quentin tarantino felt the need to manufacture camp in his latest retrochicmartialartssatire saga his efforts are not successful his goal is not noble for if there is anything more pitiable than genuine camp it is counterfeit campthe film opens with promise a stark black and white closeup of a badly beaten uma thurman whos character name was not made known at the press screening ostensibly held at gunpoint by an assailant somewhere out of frame the scene is well devised and builds tension culminating in a moment of horrific violence and indicates that there is an intense film experience to follow what actually follows is a laughable slapstick nod to hong kong action cinema to which tarantino claims he owes everythingi cannot use the term homage for an homage does credit to its subjects fine points this only debases the merits of hong kong cinema delivered with nil grace shot with an eye for retro whose novelty has worn off long ago the film moves at the pace of a sputtering race car lightning fast at points painfully slow at others it is clear that tarantino means to drag us through the mud these lapses in pacing are no accident its unfortunate that his film builds to nothing even as an austin powers style parody the film is weak not even a knowledge of hong kong action films can cultivate an interest in tarantinos plot twists to say the least tarantino has a funny way of paying his respects if i didnt know better id swear he was cruelly mocking hong kong cinemathere are a few bright spots however uma awakes from her coma only to find herself without the child she was bearing at the time of her assault a twisted sexual assault follows as does her swift revenge the scene actually manages to be dramatic and for a moment fools the viewer into thinking that the film may undergo a change of heart alack and alasa long anime vignette is certainly one of the high points in the film stunningly animated these scenes are exciting edgy and exhilerating even though the departure from and return to live action is wholly unwarranted and seems to have been done simply for the sake of appealing to a wider base of high school underclassmenwatching it is hard to remember that he ever made reservoir dogs and pulp fiction films that perfectly nailed the line between hardasnails crime flick stereotyping and substantive cinema both films were funny hard hitting powerful and resonated long after the screen had faded out but in tarantino simply aims to get a few chuckles out of the scads of frat boys that he knows will attend his film by the hundreds a beheading here more severed limbs than you could count sprays of blood tarantino cannot clera the bar of his previous works and its a shame luckily the film makes it clear that it is not to be taken seriously if only it were entertaining enough to carry its own weight,cruel
spoiler to say that this 4th film by quentin tarantino was eagerly awaited is to grossly understate the situation this is a film which has generated more attention prior to its release than any of his previous filmsafter awakening from a 4 year comma the bride sets out to kill each member of divas deadly viper assassination squad who left her for dead starting with oren ishii lucy liu and moving on to vernita green vivica a fox this is about the head and tail of the storymany have commented about the action sequences  claiming them to be absolutely incredible and the like i however was not so impressed i believe that the action is bland and lacks imagination we can see tarantino at his keyboard now  and she cuts him in half a film which has achieved this much press and good reviews should be prepared to offer the viewer something they havent seen before but alas fails in this department as it does with so many others we see eyes coming out yeah done better in evil dead we see people being cut in half better even in 13 ghosts arms being lopped off and simple stabbings a generation desensitised to screen violence however will see nothing that foreign films havent beaten 5 years ago i found myself becoming very bored even during the great crazy 88 scene not even an interesting new angle was used to capture these events there is an exception however the fight between chiaki kuriyama of battle royale fame and thurman is very well donethe style of the film is another area of concern as it both succeeds and fails on different levels i really liked the soundtrack and i enjoyed also the use of japanese dialogue and subtitles to talk about areas of american society such as pizza etc this is probably where the humour ended for me the editing i would say is atrociouswhy is there so much rubbish cluttering up the film sally menke must have been sitting there going you know tarantino if i cut out all the unnecessary stuff then not only would it be more exciting but it would also take the running time down tarantino then must have crooked his eyebrow and said  no  thanks anyway ok now zoom into her toe 1234 and back to her face 234  and back to her toe 234 etc oh and wasnt tarantino pleased to get sonny chiba involved  yeah sonny you can play your character from the hattori hanzo tv series guess what i believe we can gicve about a 15 min dialogue scene for no reason the character of oren ishii also did not merit her screen time i do believe that there are some nice little touches that most people miss but a few will linger on the fact that the green hornet theme very cool tv showcomic plays when she is on that plane is pretty sweet thurman makes references to kato masks bruce lees character in the green hornet and the very tracksuit she is wearing is bruce lees from the game of death perhaps i just left bitter by these references because i and some others know that this knowledge comes with commitment and effort  and all these people will leave thinking that they are really hardcore without putting the work in there are also subtleties that add depth to the film such as the perception of bruce lee vs bruce lee when thurman takes on the crazy 88 she is dressed in the enigmatic tracksuit of the ultimate martial arts legend while the 88 are done up in kato gear where bruce played second fiddle to van williams seen in this way the film could be said to be about racism but based on the content of volume 1 however there seems to be little to justify these moral undertones and they seem to be slotted in to substantiate the film the movie however is stylish and we are never left thinking that we are out with the hands of a capable filmmaker the story moves fluently and is swift but this said however and i hate to end with negativity the reason we have this security during the film is that it is so familiar the zoom in to the eyes is very shaw brothers the banister action left me looking back to crouching tiger and the dialogue sounds like a tarantino rip off i cant say i wasnt disapointedthe best way to describe is to compare it to a best of music album the new comer may buy it and feel satisfied but the experienced fan of the band wouldnt be so keen to hear people talk about the greatness of is to hear the man who has just bought the best of the beatles walking up to a beatles fanatic  claiming to be just as experienced with the band it is exactly the same perhaps i could add another star or two to the current award if had any fresh ideas or visions as it stands however can only be reviewed on its merits which i feel are limited the line between inspiration and plagiarism isnt thin its very substantial it is in this area that i believe has fallen short the most lets take a moment to think about tarantinos intentions for if it was released as a bmovie then nobody would like it they would say the film is unoriginal poorly constructed and pretentious wants to be a bmovie and i commend the efforts but at least they are creative and artistic is just a mess ah well maybe volume two will make it all work    until then branch out with your movies let be only an appetiser to the world of cinema you have yet to experience,cruel
i didnt see kb1 when it came out because it was almost exactly how i expected  minimal plot strung together by a series of bloody fights anyway i decided to give it a chance i had to fight the urge to turn it off after the first fight scene it was very unbelievable and went down hill from there there were many scenes which insulted my intelligence but the hospital scene was probably the worse after just coming out of a lengthy coma she was able to undress a grown man then dress herself in his clothes pull herself into a wheelchair wheel herself out of the hospital into the parking garage none of which she had seen having been in a coma since her arrival without being stoppedquestioned by any hospital staff then pull herself up into an suv however she didnt have enough lower body strengthcontrol to move her big toe once in the suv yeah right of course believability isnt mandatory when youre making your own movie when qt sells a script ill be the first to check it out until then ill leave his special brand of scifi for those with less logical minds,cruel
all i can say is that it was the stupidest movie ever,cruel
this film is not for anyone who conceals a brain inside their actual skull for the most part this film is not tricking anyone it is what it is a b movie an action film centered around sillycorny entertainment the action scenes arent even really that great you can almost pick apart every scene and say oh that happened before in this movie its like one huge walking parody sadly its not it is its own monster i tried to really like it i viewed it twice by the second time i already dubbed this film an unwatchable to the sheer lack amount of seriousness it i enjoy believable films even in fantasy if their is a dragon i have to believe there could be a dragon in nothing is believable except for the fact bill would want to kill everyone because the guy actually sees how bad they really are at acting and making this film now if you enjoyed this movie all i can say is good for you im happy you are so easily entertained by stupidity i wish at time i had this gift of watching shitty films and liking them but i dont and sadly i see them for what they truly are a disgrace to cinema only watch this film if you clearly understand what your getting into this is not a serious story it will never attempt to be serious in all seriousness it will forever try to however amuse you with trying to be witty and corny at the same time if thats your bag of entertainment so be it but i prefer a film that tries to bring me out of my own head instead of bashing me right into it to ridicule the whole film movies are better when they can be an escape and take you to a different world with your constantly reminded your watching a film and there is no escape from the sheer amount of stupidity in the film its like the icing on the cake its thick and its on top its the first part you see is the same its rich with corny one liners and action scenes to make you laugh im all for comedy but not in this form and i def prefer my action movies to have realism and attempt to be realistic instead of a walking punch line,cruel
some said this movie is sexist because the lead woman set out to kill mainly women some said this movie is racist or fascist because the winner is so white shes blonde and the losers are mostly nonwhites some said this movie is just glorified glossy violence with fashion without these offensives the movie has nothing else to offer tarantino said the movie is fun precisely because of the sexist and racist and senseless violence aspects they are all correctis not for everyone if you have an average kind and gentle heart basic selfconfidence okay love life very little power envy very little bitterness in your soul if your pleasure does not depend on the pain of another you will be bored or repulsed by this moviethis movie had great success with the following1 men who enjoy seeing women slaughtering each other in a femalecontestantsonly hunger game scenario is a designer costume catfight orchestrated by man for the pleasures and profit of men men shall feel strangely reassured and empowered after watching this femalecentered movie2 white or blonde females who envy and hate smart and sexy asian black chicks for stealing their limelight or white men will get to see these sexual competitors beautiful naturally golden skin sliced open and blood gushes like fountainhead real and fake blondes will regain the sense of specialness and queenlike privileges they once exclusively enjoyed in better times3 white supremacists who will enjoy watching lesser race females meeting their inferior fate at the superior fascistsharpen knife point of their superior fascistapproved white blonde female they will regain a sense of righteousness and faith in divine justice4 westerners who think they could do chinese or japanese martial arts better than the chinese or japanese without having to learn chinese or japanese or basic mental physical or spiritual discipline all you need is bruce lees yellow magic track suit you are yellow kickass killer nothing is more reassuring than cartoonized yellow peril threats5 adult males with mental age of an angry 5 yr old boy and the sex life of a frustrated 80 yr old man looking for some beautiful skin to pierce their hard power tool into some said it doesnt take much genius to package juvenile fascist violence into a 2 hour show any halfwit preteen boys could pull this off not all true you still need to be grownup unhealthy prematurely balding and impotent desperate petulant and angry enough like tarantino to cultivate the art of hate distillation it certainly takes his rare genius to successfully sell standard fascist aggression punching bag as pure funbravo tarantino bravo,cruel
i first heard about this movie over the radio i really thought it was like a depressing drama where someones kid dies and blah blah blah but then i saw the clip where lucy lui swipes off boss tanakas head and i thought id watch it because lucy lui is one of my favourite actresses i saw it in a hotel room and i immediately liked it my mom thought it was too gory and violent and therefore wouldnt let me buy it but it was my birthday and i got one of my friends to buy it for me reluctantly my mom let me keep it im so glad she did in my opinion it was one of the best actioncomedy movies ever made i dont know if it was originally meant to be a comedy but i found it really funny the fight scenes were as could be expected very unrealistic but nonetheless great fight scenes the only problem i had with it was the extremely unrealistic amount of blood that squirted everywhere when someone died it was a little overexaggerated oh well it was still a great movie for fans of gory funny actionpacked cult movies,cruel
i watched this movie some time ago having been drawn in by all of then hype about it i went in expecting a insanely violent action flick as others had told me and i was not disappointed however what i was not prepared for was the wave of almost worshipful comments and reviews that i was hearing about it people were saying that this was a masterpiece and i believe it is on imdbs top 250 at 58 i honestly cant comprehend this i mean yeah it was entertaining but that was about all this movie had loads of style but little or no substance as ive said before theres nothing wrong with that but if thats the way a movie is made it does not deserve to be on the top 250 take lucy liu she is really a onedimensional cardboard villain if you will serving little purpose other than killing 20 minutes allowing mr tarantino to make 2 volumes the same with the first person killed in the movie and the character of elle driver the only really fascinating character from this movie was gogo yubari in all i believe that this movie was very entertaining but also highly overrated watch it for a good ultraviolent action flick but dont go in expecting something on par with true classics,cruel
this movie is boring there is no plot the only reason people rate it so highly is because it was written by tarantino people will say oh his movies are too complicated for you to understand but nah its just boring dont waste your time,cruel
warning no one who doesnt want to see billions of gallons of blood severed limbs and superduper graphic violence should ever see this movieperiod it is the most violent film i have ever seen and find it amazing it didnt get an nc17 rating i guess you cant show nudity in american films but bloody graphic violence is okay what a world this isnt a complaint against tarantinobut one about the current insane rating systemthis film is not for everyone in addition to the graphic violence the film is an americanized marital arts film with overtones of italian westerns if these sort of genres are not something youd want to see then once again the film is not one youd appreciate as for me i am a huge fan of martial arts films and spaghetti westerns so it was right up my alleyeven though i am not a fan of ultrabloody films and because i have loved the films of sonny chiba and shaw brothers martial arts films this movie is an absolute must as it is a loving tribute to the genre so many references to these films are buried within the film its best you look through imdbs trivia section before or after you see the filmthen youll really appreciate the film in addition to the martial arts angle the film happens to be perhaps the coolest movie ever made and the coolest part of the film to me is the music the soundtrack is simply brilliant and bizarrefrom the haunting music of zamfir to the quirky japanese allgirl surfer band the 5 6 7 8s almost as cool are the costumes and characters the 88s the insane school girl assassin and the rest are really ridiculous but so so cool and the film gets superhigh points also for its strange styleranging from an anime film within the film a black  white segment and action scenes that go on practically forever there is a lot more i could say about this film but considering that it was released seven years ago and there are a zillion reviews for it already ill cut this short while the film is intensely violent for what it is you simply cant find any better it is in the action department as good as it getsby the way this is not a criticism of the film but have you ever wondered why folks in films of the genre never use guns to stop the hero youd think at least one of the 88s would have been carrying a gun in the huge fight scene in japan,cruel
after seeing volume one tonight i am certain of two things 1 quentin tarantino mastermind behind as well as the smash hits reservoir dogs and pulp fiction is the only filmmaker that can walk the tightrope of doing an unfortunate ripoff and a brilliant homage without falling onto the wrong side and 2 i agree with his logic now of splitting his epic in two parts if only because of the climactic battle between the bride and the crazy 88 fighters any attempt to top this within the same time frame of a three hour motion picture is ridiculous by doing so tarantino leaves us with one of the most violent and i mean that as a compliment since when violence is frowned upon in movies that means its impressive instead of tongueincheek like in horror films visceral and definitely entertaining films of the year after seeing it once to which ill probably see it again i can say that its my favorite moviegoing experience of the yearthe bride her nickname in the group black mamba is killed off or so they thought by her fellow partners in the deadly viper assassination squad when she awakes from her coma four years later she regains her consciousness of what she must do kill the four partners and then her boss bill played by the immediately recognizable if only by voice david carradine in volume one she goes after vernita green copperhead and oren ishi cottonmouth and like in tarantinos past efforts the story is told in a nonlinear style that gives answers first questions later but these story elements are unlike his past films just little details even to those who wont like and i know they have their understandable reasons  for americans this will be one of the most violent films they may ever see and for marital artskungfu fans on asia this will be something standard however in parody but the violence is done with the message that its all stylized and that is a triumph of style over substance is a compliment the haters may feel poking at them id say though that kids under the age of 12 and characterstudy film buffs should stay clear of this one as an avid filmgoer i found that there was so much to soak up in that at the least it contained some of tarantinos most daring direction taking chances that paid off and borrowing to the point of a true transcendence of the materialone thing i love in a movie personally is when certain images or scenes stay in my head long after the film is over and there are a few in this one that are still buzzing in my head as i write this commentary the climax is impressive yet the sequence that had me completely riveted was the japanese anime sequence detailing the background on oren ishi like much of the rest of the film it has bloodshed intense closeups and quick editing but there was just something about this whole sequence the emotion that came through it id have to say its one of tarantinos finest moments and equal credit goes to whoever directed the animation which ranks second to toyoo ashida director of the classic fist of the north star right up there with the overdose in pulp fiction and the opening in reservoir dogs in fact i also think an equal amount of praise should be given to cinematographer robert richardson contributing heavily to qts vision and his usual editor sally menke for putting it all together volume one accomplishes what it was hyped for its a spectacular showcase for devourers of grindhouse cinema while ive never seen any grindhouse films surprising i know i felt i had seen so much of the genre in this one effort and for tarantinos main fan base and while it is often assumed his fan base if mostly comprised of some film buffs and a lot of guys who like guyactionmovies having uma thurman vivica a fox and lucy liu who all contribute great fightstunt work by the way turns into something of a chick flick as well,cruel
the good literally almost everything because a review should have more analysis though lets talk about the movies simplicity the premise is very simple a woman left for dead seeks revenge from all the people who wronged her particularly bill in that simple premise however comes a mashup of action genres and scenes that simply top each other the brides fight against oren is one of the most visually beautiful moments of movies i have ever seen but you could make a case for her fight against vernita the animated interlude or any other moment in this masterpiecethe atmosphere of this movie is topnotch and the way backstory and the inner lives of the characters are parsed out throughout the film is something to behold if you want to see just action setpieces this movie has you covered but if you want to analyze and read more into this film there are so many details to uncoverthe bad the first five minutes of this film are very disorienting and upsetting in a way that i feel is too much for this film even though it does give us some backstory at the same timethe feet scene in the middle is too much thoughconclusion a masterpiece of a film go see this movie now,cruel
 its crappoor little quentin isolated himself in his little little home with his exclusive 35mm prints of garbage or has werner herzog might have said why bother ditto jeanluc godard or rainer werner fassbinderhis last attempt at partying  the four rooms sequence where he didnt have any more subject matter to impart or build off gone where the days where including a tj hooker audition reference built even something like local color and sliceoflife who wants to hear about him partying with wellknown people the rest of us just see on tv  was an abject failure and after proving hed heard of elmore leonard kinda like proving youve heard of stephen king okaaay but as far as films go that could mean anything circa 96 you get to whewbreathe outwheeeeeewbreeatheso he hooks up uma thurman with an improbablysustainable revenge fantasy shes got nothing better to think about besides its like tv ya know ninjas and uh  yeahwatch her suffer on the floor as you hear the beats of the boots come nearer with shadow what fun find out shes been repeatedly raped in the hospital while unconscious cause yuk yuk what fun she can get revenge now and  the whole movies so odious its hard to find it fun its also stupidquentins used up his goodwill reserve what you might call his welcome but nobody seems to have noticedoh and ps pagan kennedy wrote in her blurbed by richard linklater and douglas coupland book platforms about the 70s that david carradine lived as though yes he thought in real life he was kane from kung fuapparently reviving this didnt do to well for himyuck what a mess,cruel
the output is bad the amount of blood is like the fountain it is a disgusting film,cruel
it reminded me a bit of lord of the rings pulp fiction and death rides a horse the best dramatic tarantinos feminist kung fu movie also i loved the cast and the characters i did not expected uma thurman to be such a good actress she only plays in boring movies with forgettable roles this time no i loved his technique with blood and also i liked the whole case with pai mei and elle sometimes vol2 reminded me karate kid and also i wanna thank robert rodriguez and rza for morriconesand not onlymusic i also loved daryl hannah villain character and lucy liu he used actors they were really forgotten like carradine gordon liu hannah etc,cruel
i absolutely adore this movie tarantinos perception of the world is astonishing i just love how he he can make everything look so incredible many fans would file under guilty pleasures thinking its not that good of a movie but like it anyway somehow i on the other hand reckon this is one of the most underestimated movies of all time its just this amazingly executed satire of almost everything after watching it youre not quite sure if the actors werent just mocking you for two hours for watching it through or if you just filled an empty hole in your soul thats been aching for ages i feel like this movie is just a big joke that turned out to be one of the most iconic tarantinos works his unique perspective never fails to amaze me i doubt quentin himself had thought this would be such a hit its just a shame that its considered a blokbuster when in fact it shouldve been nominated for an oscar or something,cruel
in a nutshell this is anime there shouldnt be so much hype about this movie i really enjoy the other movies by tarantino but i feel this movie was basically copypasted from already existing samurai styled anime the story is average the characters the roles the speech the fighting style the costumes even are all an exact copy of already existing samurai anime out there a few examples of such are samurai champloo afro samurai rurouni kenshin and many more which existed before this movie i guess those that havent seen enough anime or asian action movies wouldnt really know about this and think wow this is so original its really not now when it comes to cinematography sure it was beautifully done but as for the rest this movie doesnt deserve credit for fighting scenes and characters that already existed,cruel
the cg effects and color blending is perfect i will give it that but the plot is boring to death this is a thousand levels lower than the average samurai movies ive seen else where and it cant even smell the toes of mob movies like godfather it is a mediocre fantasy of a white girl kicking the ass of a famous japanese mob and it has the stink of white supremacy first of all how can an white assassin that waked up from a fouryear coma suddenly become a such excellent japanese sword user that even beats a mob lead by one of the best japanese assassin oren ishii during the time they run around killing people like cowboys with guns and powder oren has ruled japan with her extraordinary sword work oren is not just a mob leader she has a traumatic past and the superhuman gift that allows her to take down the famous gangster matsumoto in her first shot at the age of nine after that she has always been struggling in the swamp of blood and violence but she didnt even last 5 minutes in the fight with our bloody bride four minutes and 59 seconds to be exact after she is wounded on the knees she seems to surrender in her heart but before that the bloody bride has been wounded all over her body and has been severely scratched from her back by oren the bride is much more physically and mentally exhausted than the elite assassin oren how come she is so easily subdued if this bloody bride is such a genius how come she was so easily eliminated by the assassins 4 years ago watching a whole hall of overlaying corpses displayed in the pool of blood i sink into deep suspicion second of all we understand that bill is a student of hattori hanzo hattori writes bill on the window right after the bride says i have come here for one of your studenttherefore bill is one of hattoris students oren also holds deep respect for this retired swordbuilder but hattori decides to build the sword for the bride without hesitation he even gave the bride a japanese kimono to finish the ceremony of granting her the sword so he actually hold deep grudges towards those student of his japanese mobs are not regretful towards their deeds they are merciless cold blood murderers they play by the rule then they enjoy the success hattori has done making swords for 28 years and he also finished his education for bill long ago now he suddenly feel sorry for this strange white girl and decide to overthrow all his gangster philosophy and help to kill his former students it does make any sensethe only thing i appreciate here is the camera work and the opponent colors white and black yellow and blue red and green all the colors render this movie an surreal quality with the insertion of comic book fragments i guess this movie is supposed to tell a legend because the movements and characters are so elegant and fluent and distant like they step off a fairytale the director is perfect i will give his storytelling techniques a hundred points but the plot is unfit for a large scale fiction movie like this hate to break it to you quentin tarantino you have to find a better comic book next time,cruel
take out all that endless sword fighting and what you have is a remake of francois truffauts 1968 hitchcock homage the bride wore black and just in case you didnt quite get it tarantino throws in composer bernard herrmanns whistling theme from his score for roy boultings 1968 british thriller twisted nerve you have to hand it to tarantino he knows what hes after and how to get it he simply steals from the best to his credit the direction is always smooth inventive and surehanded whether his films are good or bad they always look great no expense is spared and no detail is too small to fill the screen with eyepopping visuals now if only he could refrain from all that blood and guts he might make a good movie someday,cruel
so i watched this last night ive always loved quentin tarantino movies was really looking forward to this one and i wasnt disappointed this movie has tarantino written all over it this movie is brutal yet beautiful the main characters mean business look sharp and deliver this kind of storytelling is very rare keeps you on the edge keeps you guessing lot of high points lot of action one of those movies you wish you had seen in the theater im not a big fan of action movies but when it comes with a great story oh wow must watch i cant wait to watch vol2,cruel
one of my all time favourites is heart stopping mindblowing greatness every time i watch this movie i literally cheer and shout at the screen as the bride slices and dices her enemies in bloody pieces uma thurman is simply amazing her intensity and motivation keeps the movie moving at a relentless pace her line delivery is badass as she faces up to her opponents teasing them and threatening them by the time she stops talking you are just waiting for her to perform some insane fight move thurman plays the bride who is gunned down at her own wedding by the highly trained deadly viper assassination squad she is assumed dead but fortunately the bride awakes from a coma and sets out for brutal revenge and revenge has never looked so good the fight scenes are the best ever all expertly staged with equal jaw dropping violence in each one tarantino executes the violence through silence just before an attack there is virtually no sound just an atmosphere and a wall of tension then all hell breaks loose the first fight between vernita green and the bride is tough as nails as they throw each other around the room into cabinets and onto tables even the animated scene showing o ren ishiis childhood is splattered with blood and its glorious then theres the unforgettable finale that sees orenishii send in her best bodyguards and the crazy 88 to take the bride down this scene is one thats worth rewinding just to be blown away every time blood spews out from limbs like a fountain heads roll across the floor arms are torn to shreds and you feel every bone crunch and character pain yourself because its such an effective scene before this scene is the stand off with gogo yubari who has a thing for violence using a swing blade she knocks uma thurman about but she cant be knocked down she is not to be messed with and youll believe me when you see this finale as it is incredible beyond words stunt double zoe bell deserves an honourable mention for her incredible work would i watch this again id be stupid not to this is a super slick movie that will leave you breathless and it stands for me as tarantinos greatest one that will be hard to pass if he makes a third film i will be delighted,cruel
like all of tarantinos film you love it or you hate it presented as a bizarre action film vol 1 is fascinating unforgettable and definitely not a movie for childrenin this film comes to attentions tarantinos love for oriental culture martial arts katanas and tributes to japanese directors  the brides costume reminds bruce lees in game of deaththe score by the rza is overwhelming the fighting sequences are spectacular loved the last onethe performance from uma thurman is brilliant lucy liu manages to give a decent performance and probably tarantino has the merit for it,cruel
20 minutes thats all i lasted watching this movie the plot wasnt going anywhere the characters were unconvincing violence for the sake of violence doesnt do it for me i watched pulp fiction a few months ago and i thought it was ok so i gave mr tarantino a second chance his way of making this movie reminds me of a 14 yr old telling of a bruce lee movie if you are attracted to fight choreography i will understand why you might like this movie but thats not my cup of tea in order to make a good movie you need to have a good story to tell it only took me a few minutes to figure out that the story just wasnt there so i turn the movie off and made better use of my time,cruel
well i think it is one of the most violent and kick ass action movies everything about about this movie is bloody and freaking great quentin tarantino really made some amazing strides his style of doing everything especially the carnage and bloody spatter of showering blood when every limb get cut by katanathe great homage to italian movie is evidentit is great alsoit references to japanese especially the samurai movies is very good last but not the leasthomage to american culture of classic rape and revenge flicks it is really a good mixture of everything and very entertaining its like watching martial art movie in tarantino styleactors performances are great lucy liudaryl hannah and chiaki kuriyamareally liked her in school uniformas i heard tarantino signed her because of his love for her movie battle royale and especially uma thurmanshe is just breathtaking the dark humor chicks fighting nonlinear story lineclever dialogues and good cinematography i really loved the story of oren ishii the animated sequence as violent and as amazing as the movie our genius director really knows how to depict every character i have so much to say about this movie but i think that will be all not tarantinos masterpiece but a differentmarvelous and high stylized approachthumbs up my score is 85 but i am giving 9,cruel
wow what a film quentin tarantinos 4th film is his most violent yet with a terrific script sharp humor and interesting characters this is qts 3rd best film 2 inglourious basterds  1 pulp fiction but while qts other films are laced with more dialog than anything this film is solid action but with some raucous dialog the performances in this film are nothing short of brilliant uma thurman is excellent as the bride lucy liu is just as good and david carradine is the star of the show as the title character if you want a solid action film this is it but be warned the gore and extreme violence in this film is not for every taste it is seriously over the toprated r for extreme violence  some language,cruel
quentin tarantino does what he does best in vol 1 his fourth film the movie sees the bride uma thurman who decides to escape her life as a killer she fled to texas met a young man and on the day of their wedding was gunned down four years later she wakes from a coma and discovers her baby is gone she decides to get revenge on the people who were responsible for her deathits pretty mind blowing and gruesome stuff but thats what tarantino is known for the blood is so gratuitous but thats what makes it brilliant as with tarantinos other films he mixes dark humour with peril and mixes it amazingly well none of it is pointless and none of it takes anything away from the story it just flows seamlesslyuma thurman is superb in the role of the bride the vicious woman seeking revenge on bill you can really feel her rage and determination as she ticks off the people on her death list lucy liu also does a fine job of portraying oren ishii one of the five people who played a part in almost ending her lifethe lengthy sword fight scene will keep you wanting more and the cliffhanger will ensure you will want to watch vol 2 brillianthttpukmoretk,cruel
i wrote a previous review on how zatoichi the blind swordsman was way more superior then this film i have to say i wish i wrote a better review since i was just trashing qts work just to let everyone know i like tarantinos work and i love what he writes but as i said in my other review for zatoichi there is a real thin line between borrowing and complimenting a scene tarantino in the past has been accused of being too much of a plagiarizer the plot of reservoir dogs did borrow from city on fire and the black suits actually derived from john woos a better tomorrow 2 i can forgive that because tarantino filmed them at a different pace and kind of rhythm were he took his time to give his characters detail and life unfortunately did not carry any of that one of my biggest problems was uma thurman she couldnt act worth a damn in the film she said she tried imitating clint eastwood as she tries to invoke her toughness for the bride heres the thing clint eastwood looks tough and is convincing as a tough guy uma is a lanky woman who looks like shes worried about breaking her nails rather than busting any heads the dialog was repulsive i suppose people will tell me that he was trying to make it like those cheesy action films with the catchy yet corny one liners he does do that and it is even more cheesy back then the writers were not trying to make it funny they were serious about the dialog and even though its corny at the time it wasnt to themmy next big problem was oren ishii she just didnt convince me that she could rise to the ranks of head yakuza boss of the japanese underworld her henchmen are also laughable and even unconvincing as japanese as well have you noticed the japanese actors performance are a little exaggerated and a bit too fakish i think qt shouldve made oren into a man and he shouldve been played by tadanobu asano an actor who can make a more convincing villainthe next complaint is the violence note this i like watching action films that have well done and well shot violent sequences so i dont have a problem with violence on film the problem with the violence in is that it really looks fake and dull the part were lucy liu slices the head of that one yakuza and you see the blood shoot out like a sprinkler was not jaw dropping please know that im aware of films like lone wolf and cub and also ichi the killer but those films let the blood shoot out and paint the entire screen red qt was holding back on the violence and i was so angry at the black and white sequence which was really stupid and doesnt live up to the brutality of films like battle royale the street fighter and rikioh the story of ricky he held back and made the action very tame this is a tame action film in comparison to action giants like john woo or tsui harkqt also tried involving a western element in the film most notably adding music from ennio morricone a man no stranger to spaghetti westerns i like the music but was unnecessary for these type of scenes even though i think they would have worked better in a john woo film then all around the movie is a mess and as a movie fan i can tell you just exactly what films he was borrowing fromzero woman red handcuffs delinquent boss girl worthless to confess fudoh the game of death lone wolf and cub ichi the killer a better tomorrow 2 rainy dog zatoichii know that most people would say that he is paying homages to these films and is sort of advertising them to the western audiences the problem is these homages dont live up to these films brutality of violence and the emotional depth these characters feel when committing acts of violence maybe i should stop slamming qt but i just cant help myself the movie was just not good and is slapped together with a bunch of scenes of other movies that did the scene way better then this one didwhy not just watch the original films to begin with then looking at a picture collageif i have to recommend a good movie from qt just watch inglourios basterds,cruel
now quentin tarentino is one of my favourite movie makers but when came out it was awesome i was enjoying it so much its so unrealistic but thats what i loved about it it was fast paced and terrific fun when i first looked at the cover i thought this film maybe rubbish but it wasnt when i found out they were making a second one i just preordered tickets i must have seen the second one at least 50 60 timesbut this film is brilliant but as i know it wont be to everyones taste i really dont think this is one to show to children and uma thurman is dead sexy in it fast paced action fighting what more do you needi hope this report was helpful so go down to your local dvd shop and get a copy trust me this is my top 100 films to see not even that its my top 10,cruel
volume i has the best and most spectacular bloody sword fight scene ever i have seen the film more than thirty times and it never gets old quentin tarantino is a master of mixing spectacular action violence and acting into one single film i am a fan of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs they are masterpieces as well but the thing that draws me to is the story although the story is straight forward the heroin succeeds in killing everyone in her path in her hunt for bill but what she does not do is hold back from anything she is ready for anything and is prepared to do serious damage the characters in volume i are comical and brilliant quentin tarantino does a great jog with creating flashy characters gogo is the most disturbing character while hatori hanzo is the most comical but by far the bride is the most ruthless i recommend the film to anyone i meet it is a must see,cruel
genius demented genius those are the only words that can be used to describe quentin tarantino and his uma thurman samuraikungfuspaghettiwesterngiallofilmmishmash the way tarantino combines three separate genres of the 60s  70s and lets them run amuck in a world of assassins and extremely gory revenge is handled in a pure and masterful way his obvious awareness of the importance of long  exciting buildups to excessive violence is evident clearly throughout vol 1 this is especially evident in the entire bit leading up to the showdown at the house of blues leaves first there is the green hornet theme playing as the bride arrives in tokyo and oren gets to the restaurant then the famous electric samurai song plays as oren enters the restaurant then the 5678s play one of there messed up japanese surfer songs while the bride checks out the room that oren and her posse are in then the 5678s play the famous woo hoo song as the bride enters the washroom to change and so does orens assistant sophie fatale and then da uomo a uomo the famous ennio morricone theme from death rides a horse plays while the bride slices of sohpies arm and oren and her posse come out to get ready and play the way quentin handles all of this is pure cinema,cruel
this is great quinten tarantino always delivers and this is absolutely no exception bloody stylish and wonderful this movie will rock your world uma thurman the bride she has a real name but i wont mention it yet is a woman pregnant and ready to marry a guy called tommy she was formally an assassin her old boss bill david carrandine and his assassination squad the deadly vipers kill everyone at the wedding rehearsal in the el paso wedding chapel massacre except the bride survives despite being shot point blank range in the head by bill she awakes from her coma and kills a would be rapist we actually start with her being shot then she kills vernita green vivcia a fox a member of her old team she then sets out for revenge against oren ishii after a spectacular gory battle with the crazy 88 she kills oren ishii we find out at the end that that brides baby is still alive what a cliffhanger she doesnt know but we do anyway a must see 1010,cruel
ha okay so this is actually my all time favorite movie some of you will totally agree with me and others are probably thinking uh what the hell is your taste level okay so i figured out with this movie its a love or hate there is no middle ground you cant watch it and say thats okay youll either watch it and be like yes qt has done it again or youll sit there and be like this is the biggest piece of garbage ive ever seen thats just the effect the movie gives you being said im one who absolutely loves every inch about it i love the fight scenes i love the dialog and i love the acting most of all i can actually watch this movie appreciate the acting but still enjoy the story at the same time i think this is carridines best and i know others are like nuh uh kung fu is the bestum no he did such a great job playing bill and its hard to play a character where its 99 evil but do it in the unique way he did it so carridine is good next umai mean who doesnt think shes a good actress and i like that she does movies like this shes great i love how she delivers her lines amazing then as for the othersmicheal madsen daryl hannah lucy lu and vivica fox they did a great job too i love this movie i think you should definitely watch if you havent,cruel
what porn is for sex is what this movie is for violence pulp fiction was a good story with a lot of violence in it but this thin story is just a bad excuse to let the viewer see as much as violence as possible in a totally unrealistic way when a head is chopped off the victim changes into a blood fountain for seconds this is totally ridiculous you start to wonder why heads wouldnt get launched spontaneously if that is the pressure there are a lot of spectacular matrixlike moves but the matrix had a story to let such actions fit this movie doesnt the only reason why i gave a 2 instead of a 1 is that they did do their best to bring nice filmography please open your eyes not everything tarantino craps is gold btw it is only half a movie for obvious commercial reasons,cruel
six years after jackie brown quentin tarantino tackles a new genre one that has been exploited hundreds of times in all the bmovies he so deeply loves the revenge flick and in terms of style vol1 has a kind of b look very little is told about the bride uma thurman and her motivations all we know is she was an ex killer who was brutally attacked on her wedding day and shot in the head by former boss and lover bill david carradine after a fouryear coma all she wants is bloody revenge and bloody it shall beactually a lot of people complained about the excessive violence in this film a finnish critic whose opinion i dont share compared vol1 and sin city by defining both movies a pointless violence choreography come on how can anyone take those scenes seriously they are beautiful but so surreal you lose a finger and half the blood in your entire body bursts out like it was a volcano erupting thats the brilliance of tarantinos work the movie is 5 talking 95 killing but the gore is so unnatural you cant help laughing at it and just enjoy the whole thingas i said before vol1 is more style than content those who expect the usual pop culturerelated dialogue will be more satisfied when they see vol2 as will the people who want more insight on the characters there is though one person we get to know more about oren ishii lucy liu the number 1 on the brides death list but in the end the best scene with her happens to be completely silent her slow motion entrance in the house of blue leaves its an excellent sequence brilliantly scored by rza the first time qt uses original musicoh i almost forgot there is one thing left from tarantinos earlier films impeccable acting vivica fox sonny chiba daryl hannah and the aforementioned liu and carradine who doesnt show up that much actually are great but the film really is a oneman show or rather onewoman uma thurman was to put it mildly born to play the lead in this movie shes so mesmerizing no wonder qt calls her his musean almost perfect film with only one defect the last line spoken by bill which spoils the second parts main surprise apart from that its hell of a movie9510,cruel
im really going against the grain here since so many people really seem to like this movie and think its great i honestly dont understand why its episodic with each episode showing the revenge of assassin uma thurman over one of the people responsible for shooting her in the head on her wedding day this scene is quite sadistic and is the first of the film so you know what you are getting into from right off although the violence and blood is supposed to be comic book i didnt find it that way and thought it was very excessive and to what point there are shootings stabbings decapitations arms lopped off limbs and necks gushing blood like fountains i suppose director tarentino thinks its somehow funny however there is a scene in which viveca a fox is murdered in front of her young daughter i was dumbfounded as to how anyone could think that was not offensive i dont understand the point of the film except that the point was to show as much violence as possible there is no storyline other than the revenge so in this way its like a horror movie where the only point is to kill teenagers in increasingly gruesome ways to me that is what is very much like just another slasher film but using martial arts i was reminded of the film dead alive which i didnt like either slasher horror films are okay but you dont hear anyone praising them like you do this film maybe im just a lug head for not getting what all the fuss is about over this film,cruel
like every other qt movie i have seen i either really like it or hate it unfortunately this one was the latter maybe i am too biased because i have watched too many good action movies that does a much better job keeping you on your feet and offers a much better plot moreover i disliked the overdone action scenes that may be unique because they come from comic booksbut they were redundant and lacked depthi enjoyed the performance of uma thurman and her character but too much of the rest of the story is clich and i was just basically waiting for her to kill off every one of her enemies,cruel
without a doubt the best film of 2003 and certainly master filmmaker and derivative auteur extraordinaries quentin tarantinos best film so farits strongly influenced by the two lady snowblood films tops both these flicks and then someit is on the surface a simple revenge story but qt jam packs it with dark humor incredible action great performances and music david carradine is back from bmovie oblivion with his role as bill even though we dont even see his face in the flick he is the epitome of the most evil man alive and so cool his breath would give an eskimo shiversit starts of with a brutally grisly shot of the bride uma thurman being shot through the head i jumped out of my skin when i first saw it and from there it was a nonstop roller coaster ride of a movie it was unlike anything id seen before i was floored mesmerized blown away loving every minute of this blood soaked masterpiecethe final fight sequence where the bride takes on the crazy 88s is one of the great action sequences in sinematic history sinematic since a movie this on the edge this blood filled is a bit of a sin to see it rises above mere cinema and becomes sinema a genre onto its ownremember to wipe up when done,cruel
i saw this on a whim about a year ago when my best friend randomly came over with the dvd and said you must watch this so we sat down and did and i have never been more satisfieda wonderful take on black and white anime the japanese culture and sweet sweet revenge is an amazing film that is purely unforgettable i admit to not being familiar with tarantinos work but this definitely opened my eyes to genius and pure insanity everything about this film leaves twists and turns plot points and plot holes and of course amazing blood and guts effects that are so welldone its almost beautifulthe acting was superb no one couldve pulled it off but uma thurman lucy liu always a favorite pleased me once more as oren and i was introduced to a new favorite chiaki kuriyama as the memorable homicidal schoolgirl gogo yubaria wonderful film that you will not regret seeing 1010,cruel
if there is a weakness to movies by writerdirector quentin tarentino it is that the plots are often thin at best the first two of his movies reservoir dogs and pulp fiction contained very little actual story but the experience of hearing what the characters had to say more than made up for it tarantinos third effort jackie brown had much more story to it and was my personal favorite now comes volume 1 which is the first half of what was to be one long movie at nearly 2 hours im thankful that the movie was cut in half as there is so much energy in volume 1 that it would be difficult to keep it up for an additional 2 hours during 1 sitting the plot in this movie reverts back to early 90s tarantino very thin but enough of a set up to carry the movie uma thurman plays the bride who has to exact revenge against her former employers for reasons were not completely told of well have to wait for volume 2 for the psychological reasoning behind the brides methods volume 1 is a fun movie that knows its a movie and knows that the viewer knows that its a movie there is nothing real about it somewhere youd think the fbi would be investigating a 6 foot blonde serial killer but not in this movie and thats why its so fun to watch you know youre watching something that is fake there for our enjoyment the cartoonish way 88 foot soldiers are slayed has a visual style of its own and the beauty of the final showdown at the end of the movie is amazing notice the bright blue of the snow bright yellow of the brides outfit and the bright red splatter that is the final result of the duel and its a truly beautiful scene the movie also features appropriate and timely music another tarantino staple some people will be put off by the overthetop uberviolence in volume 1 but those who remember that it is just a movie one that has very little in the way of real life will have a good time volume 1 is the set up for the deeper slower yet more interesting second half volume 2,cruel
tarantino is a true talent in the eyes of many few debuts have been as handsomely constructed and powerfully original as reservoir dogs and few films have been as enjoyable and influential as pulp fiction both celebrate the art of script writing that awarded the supreme motor mouthed auteur with an oscar however with volume 1 of his martial art epic we see his weakest script work yet the dialogue is slightly clunky at times and reams away from his most celebrated work but what it lacks in lines it exceeds in action compared with the other socalled action films released that year screams talent crash zooms jump cuts and glowing crimson abound the final 30 minutes or so of this film where tarantino flexes his action muscles are some of the most thrilling of the year it should be clear to most that with this film tarantino is showing us a different side of his world and in terms of action and style he simply excels,cruel
quentin tarantino has since his debut as a movie writer been an object of discussion  you either love him or hate him for me though the answer is simple tarantino is brilliant in vol 1  2 he takes both his own moviemaking and the genre of violent action to a new level it is quite understandable that some or even a lot of people are disgusted by his bloody scenesin the plot is once again intelligent with uma thurman as a revengeful professional killingmachine who desperately urges for a payback at her former boss bill and his people the movie goes in real tarantinostyle with present time mixed with flashbacks eventually ending up in a fabulous finish thurman was a great actress in pulp fiction but its a pleasure to watch her in its impressive to see how she handles swords for example tarantino tends to use the same actors in different movies thurman is one and michael madsen another madsen is perfect as the kind of nasty badass that frequently occur in tarantinofilms david carradine a for me quite unknown actor is also worth mentioning for his strong performance as billvol 1  2 are great movies not really as amazing as pulp fiction but it comes up to reservoir dogsstandard and that is a very good grade a highly recommendable movie to people who arent that sensitive even if much of it is censored in a brilliant way again by tarantino the animestuff gives me goosebumps  a lot of blood is wasted910,cruel
please note i have not seen vol2 yethave to admit i have only just watched this film over a year after its cinema release in new zealandi had no desire to see the movie based on the feedback i had read been told regarding the violence for the sake of violence my partner highly recommended i see itso i didon dvdthe movie is in my personal favourite top 15 of all time movieslike peter jacksons lord of the rings early splatter movies brain dead meet the feeblesetc it is artistic violence please be aware that i am not making similarities to peter jacksons early movies in general as they are in different leaguesartistically directed and like all tarantinos movies very good choice of music and used appropriately throughoutlove his use of music in all his filmsuma thurmanfantasticharbouring such hatred in the way she doespulls it off perfectly can really feel her pain and i felt like cheering her on character interaction superb the interracial aspect gave the movie more depth also ie japanamericathe blood spraying like a fountain from limbs was a bit over the top other wise gripping and prefect in all aspects9010,cruel
the 4th film by quentin tarantino what can i say  im a big fan of tarantino and i dont have to explain how anticipated his next film was  one thing about qt that i can always appreciate is how different he is when it comes to subject matter style etc etc  is probably the most straightforward piece hes done to date  the signature styles and techniques of qt are here as well and he employed some new ones also quite frankly is a damn good movie  i want to hold off on deeming it a classic until i see the whole thing  but from what ive seen so far its a film that will set new boundaries in cinemathe way his other films did im not a huge fan of uma thurman i thought she was pretty good in pulp fiction but shes very good herei didnt expect her to be as convincing as she was  being a huge fan of kung fu movies particularly from the 70s80s i loved the casting of gordon liualthough i wouldve liked his showdown to be a little longer bruce lees yellow jumpsuit as worn in game of deathvery nice homage to the master  im not at all a fan of lucy liu but suprisingly her casting here is not half bad  vivica fox on the other handis only here for style she didnt serve much purpose at all the story of one of revenge is straight forward but very intriguing  the way qt presents the film its almost like he thought of every possible techniquestyle he could think of and used it in things like the bw sequence and the japanimation sequence add a whole new twist to the film and is very creativeit works perfectly i didnt like the fact that they cut the film into two parts but i cant wait to see the second part  vol 1 is a little short nevertheless they cut the film at a good place setting up the second part very well  a very entertaining film qt has done it again  this is shaping out to be a milestone in filmmaking hell it probably is already  vol 2 will only cement place in cinema history  a truly monumental film bravo qt bravo 34 out of  stars,cruel
i have not left a theater that pumped since i saw enter the dragon 30 years ago to accomplish what was done in this film with nonmartial artists demonstrate that great martial arts film making was not buried with bruce lee,cruel
i rate this movie 1 out of 10 because of the fakeness this movie provided the special effects were awesome but the story had no real plot other than revenge uma certainly gets her revenge but its a bloody squirting revenge i dont take movies to seriously if a person is brutally beaten wakes from a coma paralyzed from the legs down and becomes this expert martial artist what chokes me is this woman has a fight seen fighting over 40 guys all charging her with swords uma kicks the crap out of them and has a challenge fighting the one woman what is that all about the movie cartoon animation is really great i would rate the cartoon animation of this movie 8 out of 10 i wouldnt recommend this movie to someone unless they are a diehard karate kid fan i give this movie 2 thumbs down great action flick just not enough to get me to be a fan,cruel
i know the title of my review is very insulting and i fully realise this and very rarely like once in five years do i ever take on an individual with such harsh words or write about someone in such a manner i say this with an apology in advance to quentin tarantino and his fans but this guy seriously needs helphell no dont get me wrong i do not to prefer to watch films that portray the bubble that i am living it i am in fact very fond of hard hitting films that make you realise how brutal life can be or how brutal a humanbeing can be or still how for a suffering death can be to point an example i absolutely loved the war film fury 2014 and recently i have been awestruck spellbound and absolutely blown away by revenant 2015 the difference between these being those and possibly many other films that depict so much brutality had a story a plot an aim a purpose the purpose aim the very reason for this films seems like violence blood brutalityafter i watched my first film by him django unchained 2012 i really kept asking myself who the director is after searching his name i literally stamped it on my head not to watch his films again because his fascination for violence was apparent from merely one film how right i was today just now i googled his name to get his names spelling right in this writeup i found this quoteviolence is one of the most fun things to watchnow the important question why did i watch this piece of gutter well i made the mistake of not reading the filmmakers name when i organised this film for myself still 1520 minutes into it i guessed whose brainchild this could be but i went through it for the sake of it and to confirm whether my conclusion after watching just one film by him was right or not well at least i have my answer an answer which in short is the title of this review,cruel
1 is actually better than 2 good story but every chapters are abit too long and slow just like his previous films you can watch the colour version if you buy a dvd from japan and there are extra fight scenes who can remember the song woohoo its very simple song two years before the film released i opened a magazine and saw a picture of uma with the yellow suit it reminds me of bruce lees film  game of death i thought it must be martial art film then i kept reading the articles quentin directed the first martial art film and uma signed it to do the film quentin hired yuen wooping who is a fight choreographer after the matrix film if quentin knew lau kar leung or have seen his films then the fighting styles will be completely different lau made some best shaw brother martial art films like 36th chamber of shaolin martial club eight diagram pole fighter etc superstar gordon liu was in all these films and he was also in 2 pai mei,cruel
a nice adaptation by one of the finest directors what you will find in this movie is an amazing screenplay that i feel is the usp of the movie if told in a linear way it would not have created the same impact a bride who goes for revenge from her assassins and what a revenge she takes you may find certain flaws here and there but this is not about finding mistakes it is just about enjoying the cinema and the sharing the same pulse as the protagonisti loved the anime partit was the best part of the movie for me i really liked the way the anime was used its like using the technology in the best possible manner the action sequences are nicely directed and the lead actor uma thurman does wonderful piece as if it was meant for her in the first chapter you will experience what amount if violence is coming up seeing the fight there the characters background is not thickened in this part but nevertheless fights are awesome,cruel
watched one of all time favaorite tarantino films thats one of my favorite revenge films featured an amazing performance from a stellar lead by uma thurmanles miserables as the bride who is on a quest for revenge also featuring vivica foxindependence dayas vernita green daryl hannahblade runner as elle driver sonny chibathe bullet train as hattori hanzon gordon liuthe 36th chamber of shaolin as johnny mo julie dreyfusrampo as sofie fatalechiaki kuriyamabattle royale as the sadistic gogo yubari and the lovely lucy liucharlies angels as oren ishii the films main villain taratino does a brilliant job with story you feel the same rage as the bride when she you understand what she does after having the best day of her life ruined one of the most coolest fight scenes is the fight between the bride vs the crazy 88 it was insane and awesome also i give credit it was tremendous build up thru out taratino did a great job of using an american woman to front a japanese inspired revenge flick this truly one of my favorite tarantino films and his best work 910,cruel
when i first started to see the film i thought it would just be an action film with a lot of blood and thats all and that was what i wanted to see but the film offered a lot more than this it is truly one of the master pieces of tarantino the consensus on rotten tomatoes is great which says it is a highly stylized revenge but what a style seriously i have never seen killing and storytelling all combines with action and such a great style this style is definitely specific to only tarantino and none can repeat this the soundtracks need to be mentioned specifically they stole the show most of the times uma thurman acted very nicely at all the times the story all the times took so interesting turns that anyone can be glueda must watch right now if you are action sucker and a must watch for anyone else also,cruel
volume 1 is an action thriller film that stars uma thurman as the bride together with lucy liuvivica a foxdaryl hannahdavid carradinemichael madsenjulie dreyfus and david carradine as billit is the first of two volumes that were theatrically released several months apart the second volume being volume 2the story follows the character known as the bride a former assassin who seeks revenge on stillactive colleagues who massacre members of her wedding party and try to kill her the movie was written and directed by quentin tarantino after a fiveyear hiatus volume 1 starts when the bride opts to leave the outfit for a life of marital bliss unfortunatelyit doesnt sit well with her boss bill so he has her former cohortsthey show up at the nuptials leaving behind a blood bath miraculously the bride survives a bullet to the head and four years later she sets out for revenge against her four assassins and their employervolume 1 is a great film due to its stylish direction as it pays homages to film genres such as hong kong martial arts films japanese chanbara films italian spaghetti westerns girls with guns and rape and revengealthough the movie is somewhat strangeit gets better particularly the action scenes as it moves alongit is a very violent movie but it was done excellently by tarantinooverallvolume 1 provides us an action movie with striking beauty and violence like no other,cruel
ok there is spoilers in this review but heres the part that everyone can read this was just stupid i turned it off a little over halfway the best thing about this movie for sure was the characters none of them dressed the same or had the same personality and each had a story the movie is very confusing and theres just pointless partsspoilers ahead this is pretty much all of it i watched the movie starts with a girl breathing hard with gashs on her face and a guy talking then this stupid 60s song comes on and goes on for about 5 minutes then she goes to this girls house and kills her in front of her daughter after that it shows her escaping the hospital she weelchairs to this guys car and then sits in the car repeating wiggle your big toe then it says 13 hrs later she goes to this like sensei guys house he makes her sword saying its his best and it took him a month then just out of nowhere they tell a girls story in animation which was very good but strange thats where i ended it,cruel
people i think i have my new favorite movie kicking singing in the rain to a 2 spot uma thurman brilliantly plays a blood hungry assassin wakes up from a four year coma and plots revenge on the people that killed her unborn child and ruined her lifethis is by far one of the most amazingwhatever kind of movie this is called its an epic feast for the eyes of blood spewing everywhere sword fighting martial arts and just plain fun action and violence plus sprinkle a little bit of dark humor i also gotta give credit for the outstanding acting the characters are merciless cold and dont easily forgive almost to the point where its frighteningoh yeah almost forgot about the theme song and the one liners you didnt think itd be that easy did you for a second thereyeah ,cruel
hi there dear imdb fans alike thanks for the opportunity to comment because i dont always know if im doing the right thing on these sorts of sites but bygones aside ill let you know what i thought because uma thurman seems like one hell of a fox except when shes trying to tell if her lips are aligned to yours and then shes more of a little troll whose under a bridge trying to find where her porridge is but regardless and of course back to uma really knows how to make a man gust with laughter and look for the nearest defenestration hole because there is no way in hell that she got that way all by herself and at that i think that we all need to give the world a hand of applause about how well we were all able to tolerate that totalitarian masterpiece of iron man logic that we saw there most likely to my detriment because i think that my ex spouse got an extra bad case of diarea after she finished watching it its kind of a girl thing but shes not supposed to get excited outside of the house and we have a tendency to slip her a laxative when she gets extra rubbish and uma really set her heart on fire wow pow wow ow it never stopped and karen kept jumping all over the furniture and so it was kind of a disaster but i guess thats besides the point really i liked it but not in a warm and cuddly kind of way because karen ended up on the potty all night long afterwards and it was the only way to keep her diareain ass from rioting in the streets so lets keep it straight actors act but patricas on whacked out outlanderistiish resort torn gadgetry cant really always light my firesincerely m haas 01 director in training,cruel
quentin tarantino is a legend in film making the first time i saw i knew it would be good i didnt expect this movie to be as good as his previous movies but personally i think he perfected his film making it is simply the most entertaining movie a director can make the action the comedy the thrills the action  the action they all add up to one of the best movies ever created some of the scenes in never seize to amaze me how tarantino came up with the ideas for some camera angles  movements is beyond me all throughout the movie are little ideas probably created on set which make the film even more enjoyable the acting was great uma thurman holds the movie on her shoulders along with tarantinothe rest of the actors do a great job i loved every performance,cruel
okay i will admit i have been a big fan of tarantinos works for a long time so my expectations of this one were high indeed and tarantino delivers it is hard it is violent it is fast and expertly done as always and the musical accompaniment is while somewhat peculiar as with most qt films of very high quality and greatly helps setting the mood of the filmno one but qt could tell a simple tale of revenge that lasts over 4h including part 2 without it becoming boring here we see that it can work however one simply never gets bored not for one second call it tarantinos magic visually a feast the actors brilliant the storytelling grippingso is this instant classic material it certainly is is this one of the best movies quentin ever did oh yes is it for any audience nope but which tarantino film with the possible exception of jackie brown ever was,cruel
i just cant understand how he manages to keep coming up with this stuff sure you can call him ott you can say he steals his ideas and youd be right but can anyone manage to bring these elements together and make an original thrilling and darn right great film not in the way he doesthe fight scene is utterley jawdropping and leaves you in complete awe of uma thurman when one of the hardest and best constructed fight scenes to date is complete seeing the making of in the extras shows you clips of the influences to this scene and it makes you respect quentin for attempting this scene million dollars and a big whole in the film could have been the result of this scene failing the make or break scene of orens downfall is a complete success and is a credit to quentin and the choreographers,cruel
i think this movie has too many good parts first off all it has a developing story which is great its soundtrack became a classical one its fight scenes are perfect i really like hattori hanzo i dont know why and uma thurman acts very good in the movie it became a cult in cinema history i think and everybody must see it,cruel
a tribute to the 70s chop socky flick vol 1 is a relentlessly paced action masterwork beautifully choreographed action scenes explode onscreen and uma thurman is glorious as the bride,cruel
i just watched this movie is brilliant the techniques tarantino uses and masters are nothing short of genius there is black and white slow no anime and a name that is beeped just for effect it is just great filmmakingi once read a review that said it was all storytelling but no story i disagree with thati was annoyed when it was split into two movies and i whinged about miramax being greedy etc and argued what scenes should have been cut from both movies too make one classic but over time it has not bothered me as muchalthough i think it could have been a lot tighter theres a lot of padding to be found here and its probably the result of trying to stretch a single threehour movie into two 105minute features i will say it is devoid of tarantinos usual dialogue too the number of quotable lines and memorable nonaction sequences is small hereas far as the performances go uma thurman does a fine job as the bride we admire her tenacity but we never identify with the character this is a problem with a revenge flick where were supposed to root for the hero and despise the enemy neither is the case here especially since we never see bill lucy liu is a joy vivica a fox has virtually no screen time same for michael madsen and daryl hannah who were being held back for volume 2 we only hear david carradines voice for me sonny chiba does the best acting job with his role as a swordmakergrossed 70 million dollars against a 30 million budget at the domestic box office,cruel
the experience of watching this movie is somewhat peculiar tarantinos movies have these stranger vibes that make you fell good,cruel
boy was there a ton of blood shed in this movie the movie started out in a really abrupt way but it wasnt so confusing that i couldnt figure out what was going on from then on the action progressed pretty rapidly and never lagged at any point each of beatrixs interactions with her former partnersincrime of the deadly viper association was unique and interesting to watch although beatrixs physical capabilities were amazing throughout the movie they were especially impressive when she knocked each and every member of the crazy 88s gang with her newly acquired hanzou sword that must have taken a lot of training and time to perfect during that scene though brief gogos movements were brutal and impressive as well and she did indeed pull off the vengeful schoolgirl look very well finally i liked how bill had an aura of mystery surrounding him which added to the thrill and excitement of this movie,cruel
not something unique and archetype boring uncool and too much violence for nothing acting is poor too much dialogue stupid plot and music is copy from older movies awful,cruel
this movie is really great and definitely kept my attention,cruel
how on earth this movie got 81 ratingthere is no story in this movie fight scene are nonsense and ridiculous it tries to show a lot of gory scenes and fails miserably i can compare some scene with absurd chinese movies other reviews are saying that this is a genius masterpiece but doesnt gives one good reason to consider it genius or masterpiece why they rated in 10 you know 10 ratings are not real thats total bullshit there is rarely such a movie that deserves 10 on 10 and this movie i can barely give it 3 just give me one reason to give it 3 please one reason i am trying very hard to rate it 3what am i supposed to watch or enjoy in this moviesexactionadventuremusicstorythrillit has almost nothing fcuking nothing,cruel
vol 1  2003directed by quentin tarantinostarring uma thurmanplot overview after a team of lethal assassins lay siege to her wedding and kill her child the brideuma thurman seeks revenge against those who wronged her and she takes no prisonersdont let that overdramatised plot overview fool you this movie is fun personified tarantinos bloody revenge thriller is everything i wanted it to be and so much more i can highly recommend this movie to anyone has not seen it and if you have watch it again it is that good of a film well deserving of being in the top 250 vol 1 is a masterpiece i have a lot more to say about this film so i better stop gushingthe plot for this movie is a very simple revenge plot but that is the beauty of it such an overly simplistic and basic plot is actually kind of poetic when taken in regards to the rest of the plot the ending is perfect and the last scene just before the credits is utter cinematic brilliance well done tarantino and thurman your deceptively simple plot is actually geniusuma thurman was excellent as the bride this could be considered her best role and i can see why she provides such a wide array of emotion and anger through just her facial expressions and actions that i think this could have been a movie were she won an oscar maybe i overexaggerating who knows all i am saying is that she was fantastic in the film withholding information from us about her was a genius idea because that really adds to the mystique and intrigue of her characterlucy liu was also terrific as oren ishi i think she was unfortunately sifted to the back lines due to thurmans spectacular and iconic performance but i do definitely think she deserves some more recognitioni am definitely a fan of leaving us in the dark about bill and the other assassins this route lets them characters blossom in vol 2i hope and means more time can be dedicated towards them it also saves shoving too much exposition down our throats in one moviewhat can i say about this movies technical side that hasnt already been said to be honest nothing but that wont stop me from praising it to death the cgi in this movie is hysterically funny and awful but works so so well with the ultraviolent over the top tone the cinematography editing and lighting are all so visually stunning it is a fantastic looking movie and i can recommend it purely for its gorgeous cinematography both the costume and set design are exceptional it is a technical masterpiece of a filmnow the action the action it is beautiful beautiful when this movie goes down it goes down there is one black in white sequence during which my jaw was on the floor in total and utter awe making that rhyme wasnt intentional but it was a fun occurrence so i aint touching it all major action set pieces in this movie are excellent and look fantastic they are stunning and true delights to watch this is such a great fun ultraviolent movie which i cannot recommend enough dont let the overly violent nature of it scare you off i havent got a strong stomach but it is more cartoony than disturbing not that i recommend kids see it though ill rate this movie 10 severed limbs out of 10 please see this gem if you have not,cruel
i started watching all of quentin tarantinos films and the one i was looking forward to was vol 1 and vol 2 but i watched it and i felt that it was good but i dont see why everybody loves it so much the films style and direction are very good and i did absolutely love the soundtrack that scene in which the bride is killing the 88s is just one of the most glorious scenes ive ever well scene but i found the characters very bland and i found i couldnt care about any of the characters the action sequences apart from the incredible crazy 88s scene werent very well shot or directed the story itself was very well written and the dialogue felt lacking for a quentin tarantino film i was just quite disappointed overall but i still like it  710,cruel
this movie is super packed with wall to wall martial arts action is the story of an assassin that became pregnant attempted to start a new life then was attacked for leaving the group she worked with she survived the attack on her life and sought her revenge on her attackers once she woke up from several years in a coma this film is loaded with great actors such as uma thurman as the bride lucy liu as oren ishii vivica a fox daryl hannah and david carradine also appear in this film although their characters dont truly manifest until vol 2 while it is easy to get lost in the action and get turned off by some of the over the top highly improbable special effects this film is really just fun to watch and try to figure out what is going on in the mind of quentin tarantino as he produces films with such a unique style of editing and transition between scenes while some of his films can be hard to keep up with is pretty easy to follow but sometimes hard to watch as the blood and guts factor can be a little rough the major focus of this film is the story of the bride and her journey to exact revenge on her attackers and she does this in fabulous fashion it seems that there has been such a decline in great martial arts films over the last few decades and vol 1 is defiantly a film that could light a fire in this genre the theme of this film is purely revenge at its finest to be more precise revenge against the individuals that tried to destroy her life and ended her chance to be with her family a true story of revenge reminiscent of films such as the punisher and gladiator some of the things about this film that really stuck out to me similar to most tarantino films were the many transitions through time the story jumps back and forth through the timeline to help piece the story of the bride together also the different shots in which the characters are captured truly presents the actors in intense dramatic fashion some of the unrealistic gore was slightly over the top but i truly believe that simply captures tarantinos style in film production this series is definitely on the list of my favorites when i just want to sit back and watch a good fight,cruel
quite possibly the greatest film i have ever seentarantino has really outdone himself on this one from the art direction to the music every little detail of this film was clearly handpicked to give the maximum effect the action sequences are plentiful and are full of excitement drawing influence from 1970s martial arts films vol 1 brings martial arts into the new millennia this film is not for everyone however as it is incredibly violent as expected of tarantino though the violence is very well done and adds incredible excitement to the filmmy favorite scene is the fight between the bride and oren ishii this scene is excellent in the way that it contrasts japanese fighting and setting with spanish music the whole film is this way contrasting things that you would not otherwise expect to work but somehow through tarantinos mastery does the scene leading up to this one in which the bride fights members of the japanese yakuza is also very memorablein short 1010 this is the quintessential martial arts and revenge film,cruel
i never actually seen this before until a few nights ago is like this action movie where there is so much fighting that you could easily get lost in figuring out what is actually going on here uma thurman was really good in this but what was the point in beeping out her nameseriously it doesnt make any sense whatsoever we know she is there is no need to wipe her name out i mean herself and the people involved with her are bad guys yeah so again why ill never understand why tarantino would add that onto the movie sure he adds everything dramatic and creative so ill have to give him credit for that i wasnt able to see half of the movie but i wouldnt consider going back to watch it again not because its violent but its just not the movie i would enjoy much regardless if it had a lot of action or a super heroine involved in it,cruel
is an epic film that is split into two volumes though one story the two volumes cannot be more different in its execution when i first watched it as a whole was definitely entertaining but as time went on i have watched tarantinos films over and over again i started to lose that feeling that i had with this film and changed my perception of it may be epic but it lacks something that keeps it from being his best workvolume 1 is written by quentin tarantino and what he has written here is simply a revengeaction story this approach is not a problem for me because it allows me to digest it simply and avoid ambiguity in its storytelling jackie brown was an example of tarantino taking a conventional 3 act structure and making it his own vol 1 follows that approach but making it much more epic and somewhat adventurous the thing about tarantinos writing here is that he has written something that is much more mainstream friendly than compared to his previous work which in a way is great because i think thats what he really wants is to exploit these dying genres and styles to his films for the mainstream audience tarantino has written a protagonist that we know very little about yet we enjoy seeing her kickass and reaching closer to her goal the film is full of dialogue though not as punchy and indulgent as his previous films as the dialogue here is more reliant on its attitude and delivery the most enjoyable part of the film is truly the last half of the film where she is up against oren ishii and honestly it is so interesting to see these two battle it out because of all the backstory and hype that is being given to us of oren ishii it makes her seem like such a challenging opponentthis is the 4th film by quentin tarantino and between the two volumes i can definitely say that this first volume is much more fun and entertaining to watch the reason this film is so appealing is that it is enforced with such style mainly influenced by the asian cinema particularly in the 7080s i dont mind that the film is stylish but it can only do so much i am more disappointed with the films screenplay rather than tarantinos vision and direction is the mark for tarantino when he started paying homages to his personal attachments in films and he continues to do so in his latter films the first three of his films has this technique in delaying action and giving us more of the characters in their most normal moments but strays away from that by upping the violence and action almost to the point unbelievability also the audience must lower their rational thinking when watching this as the film doesnt take itself too seriously which is a reason why this is viewed over and over again by its fansis also the start of robert richardsons collaboration with tarantino as his cinematographer richardson has worked on prestigious films for most of his career and worked with prestigious directors like oliver stone martin scorsese and rob reiner out of all of those directors i think working with tarantino allows him to experiment more with the camera and create something more unique may not look like a unique film as the way it looks feels more like something you have seen before and that is the response that its supposed to get from us photography pays tribute to the shots found on sergio leones films or the clichs that are found in asian action films image looks colorful and at times being so saturated it loses the sense of naturalismis also the start of tarantino relying on a film score in driving the musical side of the film his previous films were full of soundtracks that go exquisitely well with the scene its the same outcome here but just replacing it with a score from rza the score for this film isnt cutting edge or the best i have heard from a tarantino film but it is stylish enough that it goes with the directors vision there are spots in the film where you can hear musical segments either made by ennio morricone or inspired by itthis film is primarily driven by uma thurmans performance as the bride and she does a great job though this isnt my favorite role from her thurman has to play this character who is clearly emotionally and physically traumatized by bills actions but at the same time project a shade of a badass assassin who is fueled by anger i dont think anybody else could have accomplished this role physically as the film doesnt take its self seriously it does hold thurman back from showing her range in acting lucy liu as oren ishii was great she was fun exciting dangerous and bitchin liu stand out scene was when she was at the table with a group of japanese gang leaders as she managed to come off as frightening but at the same time give off a comedic under tone in her acting the bulk of the villains are not seen until the second volume so for the most part it pretty much covers both of these actressesis definitely an example of style over substance but it does well enough with the former that it doesnt lead off as such a terrible movie do i wish the script was better yeah maybe it needed a bit more but that isnt enough for me to dislike it give it a try but i suggest lowering ones expectations and rationality before heading in,cruel
what is the recipe for quentin tarantino a little spagetti western a little akira kurosawa a bit of mixed media and an artistichumorous take on the spilling of blood and bodily fluids works great in a film with exception style worthy of praise even if it is occasionally slowanother thing memorable about quentin tarantino is the manner in which he has found a loophole through the rules of conventional storytelling and narration i am referring of course to the way he gives his film chapters allowing him to jump from here to there without ruining the story always something new the smartest thing about is how you know absolutely nothing when the film starts and even when it ends there are many questions posed intentional of course with each chapter something new is revealed this is how he keeps you going in order to get answers one must sit through and endure his tedium black sense of humour and you wont get any answers if you walk outis essentially the ultimate revenge story a modern count of monte cristo uma thurman wakes up from deaths doorstep and she is eager to go after the five people who almost killed her on her wedding day bill is 1of course the reason is in two parts is because tarantino is slow he throws in pauses and segments of silence where no other filmmaker since kurosawa or sergio leone has this is one of the reason he is so controversial much of the movie is a buildup but the payoff is sufficient vol 1 has a killer climax and an equally big cliffhanger endingif you can stomach tarantino i guarantee vol 1 will make you eager for more,cruel
after having seen resevoir dogs pulp fiction and grindhouse along with this movie i can safely assume that quentin tarantino makes movies for those in the know about crime dramas martial arts films ivory tower academic analysis of pop culture and the aesthetics of violence and 70s tv shows those who are not familiar with any of the four subjects will not understand tarantinos movies nor are they likely to fully enjoy them i myself am not a film buff but merely a casual movieviewer much like the general public i have not seen many crime dramas or martial arts movies and my knowledge of 70s tv shows is limited to the sitcoms that aired on nickatnite and tv land i spent some time in the ivory tower to obtain a liberalarts degree but it was not in film sociology or any degree which would help me understand filmasart much less the concept of the aesthetitization of violence in art as a result tarantinos films and volume 1 in particular make little sense to me not having a film degree or an iq above 120 i will attempt to judge as i see it solely on its own merits as entertainment and as a storyis a simple revenge story with the unique use of females as buttkicking superheroes and supervillains rather than the musclebound virile men such as charles bronson or chuck norris that weve seen a gajillion times having a female as a tough resilient capable hero as opposed to a delicate damselindistress is a tradition that is best exemplified in the 1979 classic alien where sigourney weaver does an excellent job as the protagonist ripley this genre results in aboveaveragetoexcellent acting on the part of the actresses uma thurman is wonderful as black mamba a former assassin with a bloodlust for erstwhile allies who massacred her soontobe husband and entourage at her wedding with a bullet presumably still lodged in her brain black mamba is somewhat unhinged and given to spurts of savage violence yet still possess a conscience and will not harm those in a helpless position nor will she attack innocent bystanders the morality of black mambas vengeance quest is analyzed by the character giving her her superweaponher excalibur if you willhattori hanzo at least tarantino gives black mamba a conscience and does not give free rein to guts and gore without considering the consequences that violence will have on peoplepeople who deplore violence in movies can at least be relieved that the carnage in is so overthetop and incredible as to be cartoonish black mamba is not a realistic assassin but a superhero like those in the comic books who can literally slice and dice a whole army of japanese mafia thugs take katana wounds that would kill an ordinary person and still have the stamina to kill off even more enemies perhaps her madness and lust for vengeance render her an invincible hero like stalones rambo to whom black mamba would undoubtedly be compared and enjoying and its ultraviolence require a huge suspension of disbelief this films a celebration of other filmspossibly even violent flicks like ramborather than anything resembling real lifemany aspects of this film seem clearly inspired by other movies umas character has closeup shots that focus on her eyes as they narrow on an enemy this along with black mambas proficiency with a sword seem consciously or not to be inspired by taarna from heavy metal certainly seems to share that cartoon classics love of bloodshed like resevior dogs and pulp fiction has an eclectic soundtrack of 60s rock and pop hits as well as some weird spanish bolero instrumental that plays while black mamba faces off volume 1s main antagonist cottonmouth in all tarantino wanted a movie that was far more style than substance if the audience does not understand that they most likely will not like this movieuma thurman is as beautiful as ever and it was a delight to see those closeup shots of her deepblue eyes she is a wonderful actress and has a full understanding of what tarantino wanted for his protagonist the only other standout performance was lucy lius understated yet sufficientlymenacing role as the leader of the japanese mafia cottonmouth i will need to see volume 2 to adequately judge david carradine and daryll hannahs roles as antagonists vivicia foxs role as copperhead is all too brief but she does well for the limited screen time she hasas im not intelligent enough to get arthouse movies or understand tarantinos vision i cannot give a truly thorough judgment still it was a decent if bizarre movie with a powerful female lead who was fun to watch on screen as a standalone volume 1 is a missing piece one would have to watch volume 2 to get the whole of ,cruel
quentin tarantino has done it again this time he returns with this odd western spaghettimartial artsaction movie that turns out to be brilliant in its content and in its messagethe story centers around a woman only known as the bride everytime someone says her name we can hear a beep that was brutally mistreated on her wedding rehearsal along with her groom and friends all killed by a gang known as the deadly viper organisation led by a man only known as bill even with a bullet in her head she doesnt die and swears revenge on all that were involved in the massacre and here begins a wild ride filled with fights samurai swords and a lot of bloodonce again tarantino delivers us a funfilled crazy plot different from his last movies and in which with vol1 he exploits ironically this unusual western spaghetti flick mixed with hard martial arts action that of course mocks the oriental flicks of the same genre and uses the btype films main theme vengeance the result is a bloody fast paced action movie that really achieves what its meant to achieve and thats to entertainuma thurman is brilliant with her deadly bride role and she rocks with her legendary hattori hanzo sword she highlights this movie the rest of the cast are an interesting choice and we get to know four members of the group the oren rishii animated introduction was an excellent point by the wayrza gives us a strange but adequate soundtrack with pop country rock and oriental influencesfinishing up if youre a tarantino fan and want to see a flick filled with bloody martial arts action and a story about vengeance then vol1 is a success in those patterns  810,cruel
some people argue that there isnt anything most boring than a revenge story its really nothing more than someone going around killing people in escalating violence and with paperthin characters certainly reinforces that perceptionuma thurman plays a superassassin whos betrayed by her former teammates on the day her wedding after years in a coma she wakes up seeking nothing but revenge and for more than three hours of movie im already including vol 2  god forbid vol 1 actually had 3 hours what follows is repetitive action involving martial arts and swordsof course quentin tarantino is up to his usual gimmicks so we see everything out of order and he inserts little stories in the main story in a poor attempt to flesh out uninteresting charactersthe tone of the movie is silliness combined with austerity the characters every action  whether talking or walking  is in a slow very composed manner full of solemnity like theyre doing something really deep but then theyre onedimensional shadows so everything they say is rubbish no matter how disguised it is with wannabe philosophy everything is fake and unconvincingonly tarantinos camera work is interesting in this movie the way he crafts a fight scene is really amazing id even say epic unfortunately hes not designing videogamesi guess people who watch will get exactly what they know they will superficial fluff with cool lines and characters and lots of violence im sad to say i want more from my movies,cruel
this movie is not good it is all over the place literally and figuratively the revenge theme is good but the plot sags the idea of a hidden nemisis is not very exciting either the martial arts is overblown as well as the blood all overkill in fact this movie should have been called overthe fact that the movie moves from locale to locale waters down the plot and thereby loses its focus there is a very good fight scene in the beginning but it is in the wrong part of the movie none of the characters develop and there is no sense of place i believe that this is sufficient for a review but the guidelines tell me i need to write more,cruel
i would say this movie was the matrix reloaded of this year except that reloaded was this year tarantinos suffered from all the same problems almost all scenes fighting or dialogue went on about twice as long as they needed to several scenes just shattered the realm of even our most suspended disbelief and finally this movie just thought it was way better and cooler than it really was it had such potential and did have some really good ideas and even some good scenes but could have easily been only one hour long so this whole 2part bs couldve been one film maybe with both parts together and abbreviated it could add up to one good films worthworst of all at least the matrix decided to use the separate animatrix dvd to tell superfluous unnecessary back stories and side plots no decides to give us the wholly pointless origin of one of its supporting characters and does it with a 1015 minute segment which would be bad enough but they also decided for no reason to do it in animeand not very good anime at that last complaint the music wow was that annoying,cruel
tarantino makes movies about other movies his films lift everything from characters to plot devices to camera angles glosses up the costumes and attitudes laces them with adolescent humor and then swirls all the bits and pieces together in a tub of blood the results have been extremely inconsistent but never less than interesting in at least an academic art house sort of wayvolume 1 is essentially a teenage boys blood and sex fantasy run amok the story is so classically revenge it might haveand maybe wasinspired by elizabethan drama a woman who has been a member of an international squad of hired assassins becomes pregnant and decides to marry and retire at her wedding reception however her handler and cokillers crash the event and kill every one well almost every one she survives four years later she awakens from a coma is mightily ticked about the whole thing and decides to kill everyone who was involved in the attackas in pulp fiction tarantino borrows a great deal from a host of film masters perhaps most notably from hitchcock kubric altman stone and lynch narrative camera angles that rise to provide a birds eye view of the actors as they move through the sets disjointed time overlapping plots and a heavily stylized visual sense he also borrows a great deal from 1960s and 1970s trash cinema most particularly kung fu foolishness and deliberately sparse spaghetti westerns in terms of story and overall execution however this is essentially the stuff of a pimpleridden teenage boys blood and sex fantasies sexy women fighting shooting and slashing the hell out of each otherin this instance tarantino gets away with it because he seldom gives you very much time to think about any of itand on the rare occasions when he does he goes out of his way to point out his various juxtapositions with a gleeful i meant to do that finger and there is a lot about the film that is quite funny in the same pitch black subversive way that pulp fiction was funny two women square off in a snowdrenched japanese garden to spanish music and so on the sort of small intercultural cinematic jibe that tarantino does so well when he puts his mind to it its actually very entertainingbut there is a problem here and it is the same problem that has plagued every one of tarantinos films yes the film is deliberately trendy in a truly relentless way and often very funny as a result yes the fight choreography is visually stunning yes the deliberate clash of music and visuals and cultures is often very witty but in the end it is all a surface cleverness with nothing underneath and the film is really tarantinos ode to how hip and cool he wants us to think he is we never see him on the screen but were constantly aware of him standing off to one side screaming look at me you might describe the whole thing as an entertaining study in the directors overcompensation for not actually being the supercool guy of his own cinematic fantasiesnote to mr tarantino as a friend of mine is fond of saying cool cant be acquired it simply is and you either have it or you dont ive never met you but im pretty sure that you arent a quarter as cool as you tell people you are and im also pretty certain that you know it yourself now you actually seem to be a talented guy why dont you stop this foolishness and actually do your own movie instead of tapdancing through all the stuff good and bad you saw when you were fifteen that said i actually rather liked the film a lot of people wont it is very bloody and the humor involved is dark its worth a look and if you dont expect anything except pure surface you may well enjoy it but its not something ill watch again and i cant see myself going out of the way to see volume 2gft amazon reviewer,cruel
this is a movie for those who like to see people killed in a lot of blood i am not one of them i will call this an unreal movie in many ways like what hospital will allow someone 4 years in a coma or what person has at least 10 bar blood pressure in their body is based on a very thin story the most important is to kill those who kill however the actors make an ok performance the filming is very good except for a strange and unnecessary cartoon and the music choice is excellent the movie has scored an average of 82 in the database but remember this is for especially interested and mostly young people tarantino is good and i like the most of his films but not this one,cruel
warning really serious spoilerscuriosity led me to tape this off tv and watch it i have no fault to find with the acting uma thurman and lucy liu in particular are excellent and it is for that and the undeniably impressive action scenes that i give a mark of 7 but i am not enough of a film buff to recognise all references influences etc but for me the strongest influence is the comic book and especially what i have seen from my sons collection of anime this of course is fitting since much of the action of part 1 takes place in japan but it is most like the comic book in its focus on the central characters who often seem to be moving in a world where the outside world barely exists and certainly does not interfere with their actions to any notable extent no police pursuit of the bride after the killing we see first for instance no attempts to find her when shes left the hospital the central character the bride is effectively a superhero she survives what ought to be mortal wounds even a shot in the head manages to dispose of two men and get herself into a wheelchair and from that into a car when just recovered from a bedridden coma lasting 4 years apparently fights and disposes of multiple opponents with only a samurai sword displaying more than xenalike agility and stamina and taking only minor damage until her climactic duel with lucy lius character how the child she was carrying is supposed to have survived is not at all clearcut out of her after she was shot but we only learn this at the very end in a pretty outrageous piece of manipulation maybe it is explained in part 2not seen yetthis presentation of a character without any explanation of her abilities is not confined to the bride lucy lius character becomes an expert assassin  fine but she then becomes the boss of bosses of all the yakuza in tokyo we are not given any hint of how she achieves this amazing feat simply that she has by this time she has acquired an entourage of extremely lethal henchmen and an equally lethal schoolgirl bodyguard but the bride disposes of them all none of them takes a shot at her even with a bow  they only use swords and other weapons of similar vintage while their boss waits to fight the final duel again with a sword only why there is a good deal of extremely gory slicing off of hands feet limbs etc but all those affected survive  they dont bleed to death as they surely would without prompt application of tourniquets  especially the lawyer whose arm is cut off at the shoulder but she must survive to have information that the bride wants tortured out of hersuch total disregard for reality grates after a while comparisons with lotr are inappropriate in that characters cannot overcome great odds absolutely singlehanded they die or appear to in gandalfs case take wounds feel fatigue etc they still achieve their quest very much against the odds but they do have some magical help at crucial moments but they seem much more plausibly humanultimately this film is a series of spectacles which one is meant to admire without questioning any details of their presentation i cannot suspend disbelief to that extent but i will watch part 2 just to find out how the end happens i know from reviews the barest outline of what happens in it,cruel
okay i admit its some good technical filmmaking and has a well chosen soundtrack not original but mr tarantinos delusional idea that violence in and of itself is worth writing and directing without holding back any degree of depiction of gore is tantamount to insanity this freak lost the mainstream crowd at pulp fiction and is in a spiral of stupidity seemingly foreverof course the girl i knew in first year university who went around campus proclaiming quentin tarantino is god might disagree but i cant imagine having her tastegoodbye mr tarantino pulls trigger now thats something id like to see on film,cruel
qt should know since he is a very original artist that artists should reinvent themselves constantly especially when you have an inyourface parodyfarcelike type of production style rd pf and jb were 3 movies where qt introduced himself to the world in style with a lot of original stuff and contribution to cinema very good sense of humor creative  everything and tons of originalityhowever i think that he made his point with those three movies the biggest problem with is that it is unnecessary just some polishing and focusing of the qt style but only that there is virtually nothing really new in these two movies and what is worse qt chooses to emphasize what he preffers from his caleidoscope of creation and he chooses kungfu no plot violence special effects and pointless chaos these elements combined with good story complex acting and witty and original dialog to name a few of the things i like about qt work are complementary but in they stand alone and dry out in the filmi will give this movie 4 points for beautiful visuals some nice dialog and some good directing now and then and generally for qt which i like a lot as an artist and an innovator but man stop your eclectic selfindulgent thing and move forward instead of backward,cruel
i saw for the first time tonight time for me to do my part in informing my small sampling of the population within my email grasp of a few points that is the weakest most pathetic excuse for a kung fu flick i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of kung fu movies absolutely pathetic fight scenes pathetic and a mockery of all that is quality asian fighting after hearing so many people tell me that it was such a great movie for so long now i have decided that from this point forward anyone and everyone that ever even hints at telling me that it has actual kung fu quality to it will personally offend me since they obviously have no idea what a real kung fu flick is see any jackie chan jet li or even some bruce lee movies and just about any old kung fu rerun on some bad cable channel is better why personally offend me because if you insist on kung fu quality i am sorry but i find it insulting to my own selection of associates that i would actually hang out with people of such 1 high ignorance andor 2 poor tasteto add to that in case you are swept away by popculture massthinking and massconformity as most of the general population is let me also point out that  the cinematography was only average and above so in maybe 10 of the movie at most and thats me being very generous  the acting was mediocre to average only occasionally reaching above average  the casting was just ok  the overabundance of gratuitous violence is like dumping the whole bottle of cologne or perfume on oneself instead of the appropriate dab  and lastly the only redeeming values to it were 1the plot 2 the soundtrack pretty good even though any potentially decent fight scene was completely wrecked by poorly selected corresponding tracks and 3 the swordmaking japanese guy who was very very cooli thought i would let you all know since apparently this type of drivel has been mediahyped enough to have taken advantage of those unfamiliar with higher levels of quality movies see hero or iron monkey or crouching tiger hidden dragon and tricked most people with its childish flash into using it as some sort of benchmark if you dont agree fine but i suggest you go catch some real kung fu before you come to a conclusionyeah some people dont like me im ok with that since im right and theyre wrong,cruel
had this movie been released under a different directors name i doubt it would have received the acclaim that it has i apologize to the many dedicated tarantino fans but honestly if not for the accolades from this dedicated group vol 1 would be just another theatrical foot note from the many films released in 2003 im not saying it was a bad but certainly not an instant classic youve heard the expression that something is so bad its good i assume that this is what tarantino was trying to do with the overthetop kungfu action and corny storyline i cant say that he was unsuccessful but not to the degree of earning classic status thats really my only gripe with this film the featured band the 5678s whom i genuinely liked very much would also fall into that category of being so bad theyre good i think the decision to cast them in this film was an apposite choice i just wish that vonage didnt play the song woo hoo in their us tv commercials its really made that song become quite annoyingin its cheesy and corny way this film does successfully pay tribute to the genre of japanese action films menga and anime if this is your bailiwick you will certainly enjoy moreover its done with tongueincheek and can be quite clever at times nevertheless the action gore and story become a bit too sophomoric at timesto summarize this film is not bad but aside the cheesy tributes and overthetop gore this film lacks the depth to warrant the praise tarantino received from his earlier works in 10 or 20 years i suspect that will fall from instant classic to just a book markbottom line fun action film but lets not go crazy,cruel
i always agree with the public and what the critics say when in comes to movies i loved the matrix die hard lord of the rings terminator and the god father this is the one time where i disagree with the majority and the first time in my film watching years where i find a film to be overratednow i will admit this film had its good points the acting was good the action scenes were very good and the cinematography was outstandinghowever the film fell flat on its face when it came to the plot and character development these are very important things in film imo and lacked in these areas the plot is a women was gunned down at her wedding and her former comrades now she wakes up from a comma and is determined to get revenge on them that is it the bride main char is not at all likable we should have seen her before the shooting so we can attach with her character instead we found as a b ruthless hunting down married people for revenge that is what the plot is one women hunting down people for revenge it tries to be more interisting with loads of pointless flashbacks and flashforwards but fails miserably the only time the film gets remotely interisting is at the very endspoiler aleartwhen we find out that her daughter might still be aliveend spoilerthe gore in this film is so over used that it becomes comical i was laughing at times which i do not think was suppose to happen having people get cut and spray blood out like a fountain is not emotional it is unrealistic and funny you have got to learn how to do gore right and fails here as well the violence washes over you it has no meaning it is not like saving private ryan where you feel shock when you see and guy go torn in half the gore is comical and badly usedhowever despite its flaws is an enjoyable flick i recommend it but do not expect anything special from it,cruel
remember those old movies where what happens on screen can possibly happen in real life well this is not one of them quentin tarantino emerges from no where to establish himself as a wellknown director in his pursuit to become a film making legend tarantino proves to everyone how the mere sight of blood something that made us cringe in years past has become a must see in modern film unfortunately instead of utilizing this ticketselling obsession in proportion tarantino completely goes all out and overuses itthe japanese style film with a story that does not make sense shows that this film was targeted at violencehungry knuckleheads with a craving for blood i never knew it could happen but it did a story about some pregnant superagent bride who loses her baby and vows revenge turned out to be one of the top selling movies of the yearif tarantino meant for this movie to be a sarcastic comedy then he did an outstanding job if he meant it to be a respectable action film boy does he need to go back to film schoolregrettably impressive fight sequences are the only savior for this lost cause the special effects were overdone and the acting performances were laughableif you do decide to see this movie make sure you wear a rain coat and carry an umbrella because considering the blood hits just about everything it just as well can hit youmy rating 510 in general 6510 for an action film,cruel
did everyone either love this or despise it i watched this with my son shortly after he had had four wisdom teeth removed he was on pain killersi was keeping him company and he asked me to rent this hes much more savvy than i am toward these things it was intriguingquentin trantinos blood fest now is this a ballet or a movie because if one does not suspend disbelief even at the bedrock of the thing this is just ridiculous arms severed blood flying one gory scene after another one trying to outdo the previous one as with most of this stuff anyone who has ever banged his shin or cut himself knows that it takes very little to disable a human being so if you go ahead and accept that human beings can handle this then you move right into fantasy and as i said a ballet of violence choreographed as are most martial arts movies it works as a meandering blood portrait a jackson pollock of gore numbers mean nothing one person defeats an army the army simply widens the landscape and the dance continues is there anyone in this movie we care about i cant think of one enlighten me everything escalates and we are left with one last part of the balletpardon my naivet but the people who love this stuffwhy what is it in you that makes you gravitate toward it i know im an old fogie but its easy to see why we dont care what happens to people in war we feed ourselves a constant diet of this the violence on the streets continues a clockwork orange predicted this culture a long time ago and look around we have met the enemy and he is us i suppose that every movie is looked at as art even the wost filmmakers call themselves artists musicians seem to always do this and theres little question that quentin tarantino has an incredible camera eye i would be interested in seeing if he can make something other than a blood bath,cruel
this is gonna be a two person review by clo and moo were just sitting together so we might as well review like our favourite movie background info follows the bride a former assassin who worked for a man named bill the film commences on her wedding day when bill and the rest of the deadly vipers squad ambush the ceremony and leave the bride for dead she returns from a coma to get revenge on every person who wronged her especially bill hence the name moo wasnt awful its a definite favourite on my end even though there are some faults and flaws to the movie so it isnt really worth a 10 clo im a huge tarantino fan and lets just say i wasnt disappointed with this this movie is definitely violent not for little kids but its awesome for the older set not quite as good as pulp fiction but definitely on a par with reservoir dogs moo yeahstraight from the qt fan there hehe ive never seen anything else except for the movies from qt but to me i really appreciated the fake violence some people might complain but the violence like spurting blood really made it seem like an epic cartoon parody which is of course uber fun unreality rocks but there are some parts of the storyline that take away from the film theres no point saying what because id get blacklisted  clothats all for now i definitely recommend this film however if you are disgusted with violence or gore this is not your thing moo but its a great thing for a saturday night with friends its actually fun for all the dramaticness check it out,cruel
for about 100 years well actually six we anticipated the return of quentin tarantino to cinema many people didnt know what he was doing and there was some illconceived rumors going around that he was dead in 2000 or 2001 tarantino was involved with a broadway production with marisa tomei but most of us dont want to see quentin act he was put on this earth to direct i was immensely excited when was announced yet very critical when i found out that it would be split into two parts vol 1 and vol 2 due out four months after the release of vol 1 when i walked into the theater on opening day for the first showing in arizona i believe it was 1050 i didnt know what to expect i wanted to expect an awesome tourdeforce film filled with mindblowing visuals and unlimited coolness but i had a pretty good idea id be let down well as soon as the credits started to role i realized i was wrong this was not an excellent film it was something even better vol 1 is a masterpiece a surprising masterpiecethere are so many magnificent qualities of vol 1 the visuals are to die for the action sequences are exquisitely choreographed especially the one at the house of blue leaves the writing is crisp and not repetitive the directing is topnotch and the acting for the most part is very good uma thurman delivers perhaps her finest screen performance as the bride an exhit woman gunned down at her wedding by her previous boss bill played by kung fus david carradine  in a terrific role and his other protgs including oren ishii aka cottonmouth lucy liu vernita green aka copperhead vivica a fox  in a tiny role budd aka sidewinder in an even tinier role and elle driver aka california mountain snake daryl hannah  in an interesting role during the process of shooting up the brides wedding the bride miscarriages and goes into a coma for four years after she awakens she goes on a kill crazy rampage to get revenge on those who tried to kill her and murdered he wouldbe baby girl in vol 1 the bride only gets to numbers 1 and 2 on her hit list which are vivica a fox and lucy liu but in vol 2 carradine hannah and madsen are said to have way bigger roles all in all vol 1 is a masterpiece of a film and a hell of a way to start a film saga although it isnt nearly as groundbreaking as pulp fiction or reservoir dogs i think it will be more widely popular because of its more mainstream attitude not to mention its not an independent feature like pulp and dogs if you havent already go out and rent this along with vol 2 thank you tarantino was worth the six year wait grade a screened at amc desert ridge 18 phoenix arizona 101103made my top 300 list at 39 the 4th best film of 2003,cruel
quentin tarintino has surely directed a masterpiece in volume 1 using his passion for samurai movies he has written and directed in my own words a working masterpiece each minute of this movie blows me away every time i watch it the characters the dialog the story it all fits in perfectly at the end definitely worth the watch if your a action or movie lover alike the shocking conclusion then leads on to volume 2 which is just as awesome i know the name being killbillroxxorz might seem abit biased but i am a definite movie lover and the first time i ever watched vol 1 it surpassed donnie darko and fight club as my most favorite movie of all time theres not enough words in the dictionary to describe the brilliance and passion of this film the house of blue leaves scene makes the dvd worth the cash a must see,cruel
i first saw this movie in the dentists chair of all places thats right my dentist allows you to watch a visor with a film playing while he does his drilling and cleaning i thought vol 1 was appropriate in the dentists chair this is a nonstop action flick to the nth poweri decided to purchase the dvd and give it a second look i was not disappointed i was never bored never looking at my watch uma thurman plays the ultimate femme fatale i liked the yellow jump suit effect it reminded me of the jump suit that bruce lee wore in his last unfinished film called game of death i was a big fan of bruce lee movies and i like the way tarantino pays his respects to bruce lee and the kung fu genre as welleverything about this movie is captivating the way the scenes are set up and the music really contributes to the heightened tension in the scenes the choreography is spectacular uma really must have had to condition herself for those fight scenes you can tell it is her in most of the fight scenes doing her own stunts dont you hate it when you see a double in a fight scene you dont have to worry about that in this is the real deal folksi also like the japanese characters in the film too it brings such an authentic feel to a picture when you here the villains speaking in their own native tongue i dont mind subtitles in those scenes it gives a nice touch to the scenes you really think these fights are taking place in japan and who was lucy lius body guard her characters name was called go go she is wearing this naughty school girl outfit shes hot this film will definitely go down as a classic tarantinos signature style shines through once again,cruel
an amazing achievement by quentin tarantino very good plot very strong acting highly recommend this to any and all movie lovers this movie is filled with intensity and action many outstanding fight scenes a must see movie vol 1 ends and makes you want to see vol 2 i have yet to watch that the movie clasps onto you throughout the entire film and takes you through the mind of the bride it ends after 2 hours and feels like what has been 30 minutes one of the best made movies of 2003 and an extremely detailed story line that takes you through piece by piece expect an overall good movie and be sure you have volume 2 handy for you wont be able to sleep until youve watched it a real thriller and a classic film worth seeing,cruel
i have long been a fan of writerdirector quentin tarantino after i saw the first film he wrote true romance which i strongly recommend i knew that tarantino was destined to go far that he did he proved with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction that brilliant acting and outlandish violence can go hand in hand i was immediately hooked to his work i awaited his next filmabout 5 years after pulp fiction jackie brown was added to tarantinos resume i entered the theater hoping for another bloody tale of criminals to some extent i got what i had hoped for yet i was not satisfied i was very impressed yet something was missing to this day i do not know what it wasthis did not decrease my obsession with tarantinos work i was eagerly anticipating his next film in 2003 he made what i feel is his best work the weeks before the much talked about opening brought out the doubters of the films quality the plot was simple too simple many thought a former assassin seeks bloody revenge on her attempted murderers from her wedding day i almost began to agree with them until i saw itthe opening scene is possibly the best in the film do you find me sadistic are the opening words from the faceless bill to a bloody women uma thurman in her wedding gown after a short monologue bill shoots the bride in the head after she says something so shocking it was make an audience completely surprised if it had been at the end of any other film and it just gets better from there after waking from a coma which took 4 12 years of her life the bride goes on a revenge rampage unmixed in any film to date the violence is shocking yet it is one of the main reasons of the films greatness quentin tarantino creates a style of swordplay in which an area of the body that has just lost its attachment neck shoulder etc will shoot gallons of blood straight up several feet like a fountain this tackiness makes the movie so much fun to watch you almost want to jump up and cheer in the theater after a head is chopped off several months later when vol 2 came out the doubters were nowhere to be found it was somehow the same movie yet completely different at the same time tarantino fans attended showings of the film expecting another sword fight in the garden with oh ren ishi but were treated to another side of the bride a compassionate side who will stop at nothing for those she loves and the fearless samurai who slaughters hundreds with no remorse say byebye because the bride will be afraid but perhaps the best performance in the film is that of michael madsen or budd of the former colleagues f the bride in the deadly viper assassin squad he is the first one to seemingly have a conscience that women deserves her revenge and we deserve to die this truly brings out the character of budd he is sorry for all the people he has killed and wants to start a new life he has even gotten rid of the one thing that represents his past tarantino is able to make us take pity on the sworn enemy of the heroin and you might even hope for a second or two that budd doesnt die but dont worry because he soon proves that he is nothing but evil and all he knows is brutal murdertarantino in has created a whole new genre of film its a little bit of martial arts comedy drama and spaghetti western he has even added a few things from his old movies uma fingers a square in the air like pulp fiction samuel l jackson even makes an appearance in vol2 but youll have to look real hard for him is by no means a family film but if you are looking to be entertained is the best place to go to,cruel
this movie is the greatest movie of 2003even though there is a lot of gore there is a certain majesty to itthe acting is superbespecially with lucy liu and uma thurmanaction sequences are amazing especially when they are in black and white not recommended to the squeamish but if you can take it  u will love this film it is kind of confusing in the beginning and it might take you a moment to catch on but once you do the movie flows nicelythe music is amazing quentin really knows when to turn up the volume and what song to pick at the right time the second volume will most likely be just as good as the first to all those who have read this review and have not seen it yet go out and rent itif youre feeling confident go out and buy this ,cruel
if you liked a movie like pulp fiction i believe it was from tarantino too you will definitely like this film it is sliced into chapters that are each individual stories which do not happen in sequential order each chapter is excellent in itself one chapter is done in animation and the only reason i didnt rate the movie higher is the time sequencing sometimes gets confusing and by the end of the movie you still dont understand what happened to have uma thurmans wedding party attackedthe fight scenes are very unique and extremely gory though a lot of the blood looks like colored water from a sprinkler tarantino has a lot of tributes to bruce lee such as using the flight of the bumblebee song theme of the green hornet having several of the villains wear green hornet masks and having uma wear a bruce lee type body suit a la game of death in the grand finale fight sequences,cruel
this is a masterful film superbly acted wonderfully directed and expertly rolled together in an all action romp with a sword from the opening scene i knew i was going to love this film uma thurman gives a totally believable performance as the bride so mercilessly tortured by bill and his divasthe basic premise is that the bride on her wedding day was brutally attacked by the gang she left when she wanted to get married and have a baby because the attack was so violent the bride remains in a coma for 4 years when she wakes up she discovers her baby gone and goes on a brutal killing spree against the people responsible for the attack in this film vernita green a respectable housewife now and oren ishii head of the japanese mafia the venita green fight is short and violent but none the less satisfying it introduces us to the situation and leads happily on to the main part of the film which actually takes place before the brides attack on vernita green it is the tracking down of oren ishii her backstory is cleverly told through japanese style animation the whole style of the direction of the latter half of the film is wonderful the homages to various styles of kungfu films from the 60s and 70s is a fascinating take on the story and brings a refreshing view to what could have become a very stale and boring story of revenge the reason why it works so well is that it is taken to a whole new level of clever moments that thrill the audience and kept me captivated for best part of 2 hours with a film this good time goes out the window yes it is insanely violent in places but hey this is tarantino and to have held him back to a pg certificate wouldnt have done the film justice i couldnt help but give this 1010 because i loved it plain and true,cruel
i saw on the opening night in my local cinema and walked out with my jaw on the ground my hair standing on end and completely speechless i can say nothing good about that movie that wouldnt be a complete understatement the sound track as usual for tarantinos movies is second to none from start to finish even if you dont like the moviewhich you would have to be retarded not to you still have a fantastic sound track to listen totarantinos love of hong kong cinema and kung fu movies shines through clearly in this movie and for fellow fans of the genre its a fitting homage to themif you havent seen it make sure u do asap you will not regret it,cruel
the films comprise among other things a selfconscious creation of a contemporary myth the characters are largerthanlife in the manner of the classical gods and like the classical gods they are jealous violent often petty and indifferent to the loss of human life existing on this mythical level they cant be judged by human laws or ethics and social conventions theyre operating in a different realm altogether thus almost every aspect of the film is largerthanlife often in selfconscious and deliberately humorous albeit dark humor way the spurting and raining and artistically spattered blood the name of bills gang the deadly viper assassin squad which just sounds silly the numerous references to other films building on an accumulated contemporary myth the use of an anime filmwithinthefilm oren ishiis biography the brides ability to defeat a miniarmy of kung fu fighters the tangled relationship between the bride and bill again reminiscent of the classical gods and finally the revenge with a capital r motif and the brides re creation as a mother think ripley in aliens who is also largerthanlife the brides skills are obviously largerthanlife giving her a superhuman quality the films also comprise a quest story a la joseph campbell including the elements of separation initiation and return and including such typical quest conventions as the helping character who provides the hero with a gift in particular the katana the bride receives from hattori hanzo and the knowledge of the five point palm exploding heart technique she learns from her martial arts master pai mei the films are filled with hilariously exaggerated moments suggesting that they arent to be taken entirely seriouslyselfconscious myths can be funny and mythic at the same time and the films succeed wonderfully,cruel
is directed by one of the finest directors on this planet  quentin tartintino but tops all of his other great films the films main theme is revenge and it is full of it there are lots of great characters who you either really hate or really love it is full of kick ass fighting and great speech uma thurman is great in the film but my favourite character has to be the crazy teenage japanese killer gogo played by chiaki kuriyama  also in battle royalei think that volume 1 is better than volume 2 so if you havent seen and you like great action films i would definitely recommend it to you to everyone who does not like blood an gore you really shouldnt see this film as it is very violent and graphic but for everyone else go and see it now ,cruel
any new quentin tarantino movie has to rank with what you might call event cinema i say this because few directors give you that feeling that what you are about to see will be something really special but scorsese spielberg james cameron ridley scott and michael mann give me that feeling now i would put quentin up thereas it says its the fourth film by qt but tarantinos brilliance as a story teller and director is upstaged by even his casting remember mr blonde in reservoir dogs  who else could have played that and still for me is the best tarantino creation the bride played by the often excellent uma thurman is a brilliant character only upstaged in vol 1 by lucy liu as oren ishiispoiler ahead okay the film opens proper when the bride pays a call to vernita green but the film shows the brides death list 5  the five people she is going to kill with oren already wasted we know qt uses the flashbacks and back and forth mode of story telling but wouldnt it be more exciting to know or in this case not know orens fate end of spoilerafter the disappointing jackie brown had to be something special with his first two films qt had set an incredibly high standard for himself and with kb 1 and 2 he shows an awesome return to formthe story itself is simplistic but as the man said how complex do you need a revenge flick to begunned down at her wedding by her exboss bill the bride recovers from a coma setting out to kill those who put her in a coma in the first place for vol 1 the showdown at the house of blue leaves is a great finale and is filmed really beautifully toothe use of anime black and white blue photography is brilliant and does never detract from the filmsonny chiba is fantastic as hattori hanzo and another star is well the soundtrack featuring maybe the best piece of music ive heard in ten years its the battle without hounour or humanity and is used when oren and her gang are walking through the housequentin tarantino clearly has borrowed ideas from others in the genre to make it but he takes that and makes something a hundred times bettervol 2 is also excellent but as kick ass pulsating cinema goes it does not get better than vol 1 and ranks second only to crouching tiger hidden dragon as my favourite martial arts film its so good that you can watch it on its own and enjoy as a complete film  the ending is classy and the whole film itself is jawdropping simply put this is awesome,cruel
excuse me while i have multiple orgasms at the mere thought of this example of sheer stylistic genius when i saw the trailer i didnt think id like the film much  not sure why it just looked boring and the genre didnt really appeal to me at the time i thought at the time that it was the particular film going experience first date was why i enjoyed the film so much in the cinema that was until i saw it on dvd and was reunited with its greatness infinitely entertaining it does not stop pleasuring the viewer in an almost sexual way has blood entrails and limbs spraying left right and centre some of the best lines ever to grace my ears an odd yet strangely fitting soundtrack and even the costumes are cool there is also a breathtakingly beautiful scene in a snowy garden a disgusting suggestion of what happens to women in comas and a cliffhanger ending that still makes me gasp every time i see it brimming with homages but also plenty of originality makes this one of my all time favourites,cruel
by the director of reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown comes vol 1 i am not a big quentin tarantino but after seeing vol 1 i think he is a pretty good director after watching both the i thought immediately that they were classics and they should be vol 1 is a nonstop action romp which would definitely please the hardcore action fans if the story dosent suck you in the action sure willthe music is superb as well it has a great cast uma thurman lucy lui michael madsen and david carradine just to name a few it isnt just the cast that made the movie great it was their acting which was the cherry on the cake vol 1 is not for the faint hearted but is highly recommended,cruel
this movie has changed my life i have never ever seen a movie quite like i dont think i will see another one lest tarantino does volume 3 this is by far one of the best movies ever made its unfathomable to see tarantino and thurman working together again it i mean it blows my mind i saw volume 1 the day it came out and did not get a restful sleep until april 2004 the end of volume 1 shattered my mind i just wow see im still speechless this is one of the greatest films ever the dialogue the filmography the fight scenes even the soundtrack is undenyably good during the crazy 88 fight scene when the human beinz nobody but me started playing i just went crazy this film has to be viewed by everyone and if you dont understand start at the beginning go watch reservoir dogs then pulp fiction then take a break and watch four rooms then watch jackie brown and then watch you will notice so many things oooooh this flick is awesome,cruel
every time quentin tarantino makes a movie its pretty much a dead cert that it will become a classic this is no exception this is not only the best revenge movie ever made but it is also one of the best action movies ever created this is pure movie magic a usual array of quirky characters and wonderful cinematic techniques are blended perfectly with a superb soundtrack and an ingenious sense of style to make this a must see movie all the characters are realistic but outrageous the perfect direction also makes for a hugely entertaining 90 minutes the film is also very original and a great homage to past movies tarantino has drawn inspiration from movies such as they call her one eye and shogun assassin although its never feels as if tarantino has just nabbed ideas from other material he hasnt he has simply payed his homage but put his spin style and excellence into the blend of brilliance to keep things interesting their is a lot of innovative story telling styles trademark flashbacks are used along with a superb anime sequence and clever use of black and white or shadows slightly reminiscent of oliver stones natural born killers anyway ive droned on way to much about how great this movie is now down to the plot it sees the bride uma thurman getting her revenge after being attacked at her wedding and left in a coma for several years without giving to much away she gets half of her bloody revenge in a very cool way quentin uses his trademark flash back sequences to tell the story you really must see the movie yourself to appreciate and understand why im raving on about this so muchits worth mentioning that this is the big action chunk of volume 2 fills in a lot more of the back story and has a lot more quirky exchanges of dialogue this is because was originally planned as 1 3 hour movie personally im glad it wasnt this volume doesnt have much dialogue but it is still tremendously good volume 2 takes the saga into a completely different imaginative direction youll love this for its action and super cool presentation and vol 2 for the great dialogue and back storyunmissable go see this right now a complete classic 1010 its exciting fun stylish and downright cool,cruel
now im not gonna say this film is bad or good thats partly what the films about and i can see that every other dunder head has tried to review it 2000 and counting and no ones probably ever gonna read this cus its gonna get lost in the main streambut i dont know if any of you have seen the pretty obscure fury in the shaolin temple 1979 probably not im pretty sure its the inspiration for the filmsits got a bloke who looks stunningly similar to the long of eyebrow master in 2 its got chopstick training and the whole film is about the studentmaster relationshipnow this is driving me a little crazy cus i might be the only person in the world to know this thats a hell of a responsibilitywatch fury in the shaolin temple 1979 pass this on prove me wrongha and i didnt even mention masterslave morality and all that trap,cruel
to me when a movie audience either hates or loves a movie thats a good indication that the movie probably is a masterpiecein you probably dont have a middle section either you will love it or hate itback in the 70s after the legendary bruce lees death there was a boom on chinese kungfu films fast action full of violence and bruce lees wannabes they were the main juice on oriental movie theaterscaptures this time and then so much more its a 70s chinese kung fu movie a kurosawa classic a spaghetti western revisited a manga cartoon all that wrapped up in a fastpaced action movie very well directed with superb soundtrack and magnificent fighting sequencesi must say that this is the best movie quentin made since the classic pulp fiction some people wont understand it others wont stand it but many will love it cause its one of those movies made with such good taste and so many subtle details that will soon become a classicthe cast was carefully selected only uma thurman could play black mamba in such a way shes fragile and deadly innocent and ruthless at the same time uma always had that flexibility in all of her movies and is no exceptionsonny chiba as hatori hanzo is perfect the dialogue between him and uma is one of the most memorial moments in movie history hes the perfect samurai a humble barman and yet the best blacksmith in okinawabeautiful lucy liu delivers one of her best performances the japanese garden scene is one to be remembered forever darryl hannah makes a unique and great comeback and looks hot in nurse uniform michael madsen usual is icy and subtle as a rattlesnake and kungfu tv classic series david carradine is perfect as the cool mature and deadly billto review part 1 and 2 separately is a mistake both are only 1 movie and should be watched one after the other same goes for lord of the rings trilogy in my opinionjust as kubrik and polanski tarantino is the master of one thing atmosphere you really get sucked into his creations forgetting real life for a moment and live a unique experiencethumbs up to one of the best directors of our time,cruel
most films that contain the sort of over the top violence that this film has are normally rubbish and unintentionally funny however this film breaks the rules and includes gore and unbelievable acrobatics possibly influenced by crouching tiger hidden dragon along with great performances and a decent story quentin tarantino uses his normal style of unorthodox order of events but shows improvement in camera style possibly due to the big budget all the cast give 110 especially micheal madson my all time favorite actor who even in a small role delivers the goods while not as gritty as resivour dogs and not as original as pulp fiction this is quentin at his best and the minor details only means it gets 1010 instead of 11,cruel
you can tell that when quentin makes a movie he is having a blast doing it there is a sense of fun in all all his movies and the movies are no exceptionand for anyone who is saying that this film is not a well directed moviebull watch the one take scene of uma and sofie in the house of blue leaves this is a master shot done by a master film makerwell written well directed and man what great characters i am in love with go go i can watch the house of blue leaves scene over and over again and still see something i hadnt seen the first timequentin i love watching a movie that someone loved making great work look forward to your next epic,cruel
a plotline so out of this world yet not entirely impossible it has to catch your imagination the entire movie was amazing though the twisted nerve whistling was quite annoying it only added to the super freaky experience though the swearing was overthetop i wouldnt doubt id be using the same language in every situation the blood made me feel like a liveaction anime but of course it being only mediocre with similar asian movies it truthfully was bearable if the site would let me i would have voted this movie a 13 this movie had everything i personally ever wanted in any movie minus an explosion or two thumbs up all the way,cruel
i had a lovehate relationship with vol 1 now that i mention it with both installments of the latest tarantino filmsthe first time i viewed vol 1 i was disappointed you wait so long for a tarantino film i had so much expectations and at first viewing i didntbut the more i watch this film the more and more i love it exactly the same applies to the second installmentthe cast that include uma thurman lucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah david carradine michael madsen  chiaki kuriyama are one of the best casts ive seen but this film is all about tarantino and his appreciation of cinemashame they couldnt make it one film though,cruel
more experienced movie fans might posses the knowledge to compare and contrast derivation and direction with the readily recognized great movies and directors that came before however i think this is qt meets monty python and the holy grail how else do you explain the constant dissection of limbs and excessive eloquent profusion of blood from the torsos this is qt paying homage to the fight with the black knight in holy grail overall the violence is comic book stuff so overthetop as to be taken as what it is farce the plot is beautifully simple the editing and style are out of the ordinary the music is outstanding i give it a 9,cruel
warning spoilers do not read if you have not seen this moviethe deadly viper assassination squad consists of five most deadly killers led by bill there is orenishii as cottonmouth elle driver as california mountain snake vernita green as copperhead budd as sidewinder and there is the bride whose name is not spoken who wanted to quit because she was pregnant one day somewhere in the texas desert the bride wanted to marry the love of her life then bill and her former colleagues showed up and killed everyone there leaving no one alive or so they thought but they did not do a good enough job the bride survives barely and is in a coma for four years her colleagues know this but wont kill her in her sleep it would just ruin the reputation one day the bride awakens for her not a second has consciously passed and after she realizes all the things that have happened the bride decides to take revenge bloody revengeon each single one of those who betrayed her the bride sets out to take back what was once hers her life first on her death list is oren who has become the yakuza boss of tokyo second in line is vernita green who chose a more decent life as well thirdly budd who has become a bouncer is not living quite the life style his former teammates arefourth is elle driver whom seems to have nothing that hatred for the bride and finally the last on the list bill the charming yet dangerous leader if the deadly vipers the one who killed nine people in a church in elpaso only one mistake he should have killed ten it has come to this but after the bride learns that her daughter is still alive will she continue her rampage and tarantino has really outdone himself this time around lets start at the beginning in 1992 a little independent film named reservoir dogs was released it was soon to become a cult classic it was made by a no name writerdirector quentin tarantino for that hit he became famous but it wouldnt be until 1995 when he would be really famous for his classic and unforgettable film pulp fiction the film stunned audiences not only nation wide but worldwide it was nominated for seven academy awards and won best original screenplay it was nominated for best actor in a leading role best actor in a supporting role best actress in a supporting role best director best film editing and best picture it now stands on afis 100 years 100 movies he to write a segment for the film four rooms while i love the film it was not received well by anyone he also wrote the films from dusk till dawn and natural born killers and true romance all have become cult classic especially from dusk till dawn one of my personal favorite movies the year 1997 came along and tarantino was at it again with jackie brown while an amazing movie most will agree it was his weakest effort probably since the film is based on a book and not his own materialit wouldnt be until six years later that tarantino would grace us with his talents with the ultimate revenge tale the film starred uma thurman david carradine micheal madsen lucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah sonny chiba and a while lot more its tarantinos greatest effort yet personally i would have loved to have seen the films as a whole but we will soon enough hopefullythe first film is basically a tribute to all the kungfu films of the 70s not 100 original but a whole lot of fun the blood fest is going to be ten times better when its presented uncut the way its meant to be its not brutal just very very bloody tarantinos vision is totally awesome the way its presented is unbelievable the music is great as well well not my favorite still its tarantino i love the way he uses music in all of his movies vol 2 is a movie all its own the style has changed from 70s kung fu to italian westerns in the style of sergio leone the music style has changed with music from the legendary ennio morricone johhny cash and many others the visuals in the film are even better than the first this has become my favorite of the two vols and one of my favorite films of all time the film has a lot more story and is more brutal to me not as bloody but you know what i mean i thinkoverall tarantino has made a films that have and will remain classics while the rumors of two spinoffs are still lingering i dont care the ideas one being an all anime back story of the divas the other being a spinoff in the future where vernita greens daughter nikki goes on a quest for revenge against the bride the anime sequence in vol 1 is my least favorite scene on both of the films not my thing if your thing is bloody story and just pure tarantino fun checks out vol 1 and vol 2   both volumes,cruel
this is a great film some people seem to focus on the fact that tarantino has ripped off some of the greatest movies of all time while this may be true there are only a few directors who can be considered truly original cronenberg miike kurosawa to name a few instead what qt has done is create a wholly original piece of work by taking elements of his favorite movies  combining them into a new  exciting film the main difference between kb  other socalled homages is that people who recognize his sources of inspiration  those who do not can enjoy the film the same nonetheless i really wish people would stop complaining about how derivative this movie is  just enjoy it for what it really is entertainment,cruel
this is about as good as it gets when it comes to revenge pictures a women played by uma thurman sets out to kill 5 people who murdered her husband at the twin pines wedding chapel during their marriage shes out on this big long killing spree first shes goes after veronica then orhen ishri and the crazy 88 youll never believe what happens in volume 2 is one of the best movies ive ever seen quentin tarantino takes his direction to a new level and it never gets boring the incredibility and authenticity in this film is sharper than a double edge sword its perfect that scene where the brideuma thurman is fighting the crazy 88 is so compelling the scene where orhen ishri chops the head off boss tinkea is bone chilling what a movie this is,cruel
who doesnt like this movie i mean its different  than the mainstream movies are  but for me different isnt  good or even brilliant or genius  i think tarrantino is overacting  and the thing were uma thinks about something and this kind of siren comes in  totally stupid  i think its a funny movie in some ways but  i would never ever say tarrantino is a god in making movies  never  although he made up the characters for from dusk till dawn which are really impressive and awesome  that was a masterpiece but was too childishyour comments ,cruel
both volumes are either highly praised or viciously put down some hated the violence that is typical of tarantino and some thought they were uncharacteristic of his stylepersonally i enjoyed them though the first is much more watchable i dont quite understand the problem so many have with the violence was such an obvious spooftribute to various film genres and all of the blood was over the top on purpose i thought reservoir dogs and pulp fiction contained much more realistic violence was meant to be fantasy in a way and almost every element of the film shows thisno volume 1 didnt contain a lot of tarantino dialogue but so what it would get old if he did the same thing every time and while his other films show his writing ability among other things gave him a chance to focus more closely on action and visuals regardless of the bloody scenes this movie is truly a joy to watch even if you had it on mute the colors and filming techniques create series of beautiful imagery which carries into vol2 if for nothing else it is worth watching just for this,cruel
once upon a time in 1993 a no name wannabe writer sent a story idea the bride to a dark horse comic talent search request he also sent the opening scenes where the brides groom bill is killed on the altar by her exboyfriend the leader of a bike gang still in her wedding dress she chases after the gang taking her revenge one at a time nothing came of it so the writer having a family to feed put the story away until he had the time to work on it then the release of the first part of at first the story was not definite on a story line and the ninja and samurai stuff was not my story but when the second part came out i knew i had done a foolish thing to send anything to dark horse ive heard dark horse would steal anything but at the time i took the chance i any case i have to say tarantino is like the rest of the has beens when they havent got an idea left they resort to the last option oh yeah in 1995 for a screen writing class i copyrighted a slight version of the bride,cruel
this movie stunk so bad that even a half can of oust and my sharper image air cleaner could not clean up the odor of this stinker  the only reason i can think of that so many people thought this movie was innovative and exciting was that so many high brow reviewers thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread  i am actually a big fan of tarantino  reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were indeed classics  this movie is a sure cure for insomniacs unless they are die hard martial art fanatics  what is so clever and innovative about slicing heads and limbs off your enemies  what is original about about the hero killing or beating up dozens of opponents that approach the hero conveniently one at a time  give me a break,cruel
vol 1 is a story about revenge and vengeance uma thurman plays bleep bleep aka the bride aka black mamba a female assassin a member of the deadly viper assasssination squad aka divas bill is the leader of the divas when the bride gets pregnant she wants to get married and the leave the business this cost her the lives of nine people including her unborn child after the divas beat the hell out of her bill puts a bullet in her head but shes still alive just in a four year coma but when she wakes up she has some unfinished business with five people1 oren ishii 2 vernita green 3 budd 4 elle driver 5 billthis film in my point of view is probably the most violent movie ever it nearly was rated  nc17  do to the violence but quentin put a part of the film in black and white so it didnt look as violent used 450 gallons of fake blood it features some of the best sword fights in cinema history along with one of the best performances in cinema history by uma thurman quentin tarantinos masterpiece is perfect from beginning to end at the end of the film it includes the best cliffhanger in any movie ive ever seenall together this film is spectacular and its only volume 1rated r for strong bloody violence language and some sexual content100100 1010 55  a,cruel
i cant say enough about iti love this moviethis the best movie of this year and i think tarantino is amazingi love the quotesfightshumoractioncostumes and everything elsei cant wait for it to be released again in theaters in full gloryboth parts togetheranyone who has not seen volume 2 after this will undoubtedly get more into the characters and storyive heard a lot of people didnt see volume 2the soundtrack also is very eclectic and wonderfulthe actors give wonderful delivery and even if it is cheesy this is the point in most instances it is perfect for the scene and moviei hope inglorius bastards moves me as this did and as pulp fiction did years ago,cruel
just my two cents spoilers1 despite all that was said about this movie i was expecting a continuous nonstop stylish bloodfest and mindless action theres action but only in the first and last part of the movie its not as intense and well choreographed like in matrix reloaded left me waiting for much more chopping2 its stylish and the cinematography is beautiful colorful scenarios specially the snowy one3 the violence is that strange kind of cartoonish violence that a child could see and sleep that night without problems the anime sequence is far more violent but is animation the film doesnt take itself serious i do not understand all that complaints about the violence in this movie dawn of the dead is painful is funny thats the difference4 tarantino has no heart or compassiona a beautiful 4year girl sees her mother being killed b also beautiful sofie fatale didnt deserve that finale c comatose mamba is sold to a pervert5 the music fits perfectly in the movie a director that finally understands that music is as important as filming itself6 blood fountains are beautiful should create a new standard in action movies they are responsible for that cartoonish effect that smooths violence more is less7 uma feet are not beautiful feet at all are not beautiful tarantino you are a fetichist8 i want a ride in the pussywagon9 all women in this movie are sexy and cool with no exception including the bizarre musical group 5678s sofie fatale is gorgeous and stylish gogo is every mans dream oren is wildly attractive well the restaurant waitress is beautiful in her own manner10 its a movie to entertain nothing more and nothing less if you dont like blood manga katanas or tarantino at all dont see it and stop complaining 810see ya,cruel
i love this film so much nice story techniques effectseverything i have not seen vol2 yet but sure i will cause i loved vol1if you like action and samurai thingwatch it it has some scenes kinda scary because of all that blood but for the first time that really did not matter for me i loved it sobest movie ive ever seen for sureand i cant wait to see vol2 thurman is on her best in this film shes a really good actresswe can see it in the film quentin has so much talentand so here it is a master piece,cruel
i didnt want to see this movie at first i thought it was going to be stupid my husband had to talk me in to watching it i dont regret itthis movie is now my favorite and whats better is that there are three more volumes this movie was made for people who are open to wild fantasy mixed with cold hard action is the natural born killers of the new millennium xs 2 acually xs 4 you have to see this movie even if you are forced to you wont regret it i will be there for volume 2 willingly this time and i know when it is over i will feel like i just got off a roller coaster this movie really is like a roller coaster and i expect the same out of volumes 24 thank you quentin,cruel
in my mind vol 1 is the quintessential badass movie it borrows so much from so many not unlike previous tarantino films but this time this time its different more polished more seamless everything just clicks in place kung fu movies spaghetti western grindhouse surf rock violent japanese anime plus a million other obscure references lost on 99 of the audience everything is thrown in and boiled down to the simplest most basic plot ever revengei am amazed at the results i think of tarantino as a master recycler picking up film trash from the past ok no hate mail on this be honest bruce lee exploitation flicks etc were hardly the peak of artistic expression were they and weaving it into a beautiful work of artyes this movie is gory disturbingly so at times however violence is so graphic that the end result is ultimately cartoonish not realisticmy only complaint insert tongue into cheek i wish there were more naked chicks no hate mail on this either ok im being ironic for crying out loud running around i believe a sprinkle of russ meyer you know just for seasoning would have imparted a special flavor to the movie,cruel
having finally seen the first installment of i found myself not raving nor loathing this film i did however like a lot of the shall we say nods that tarantino has put in to pay homage to others films while i would say this films plot is hardly unique his way of telling it is i love the fact that umas outfit is quite similar to that of bruce lees in game of death i love the fact that they mention kato and then use the theme from the old green hornet tv show  also with bruce lee still this film imho is nothing more than a way to waste a couple of hours you can love it or hate it but you must admit that while the substance may not be much his style is almost always interestingthats just my two cents but hey what do i know,cruel
well i actually had a good time watching this one of the silliest movies i ever saw and i do appreciate silly movies as long as they are sophisticated enough not to insult my intelligencethe referential jokes are many and blinks are everywhere im surprised that everyone here seems to notice only the western samourai and kungfu elements as to me the references to gore cult movies are numerous from raimis evil dead ii to jacksons braindead us title dead or aliveits obviously not a movie to be taken seriously except for the very competent but somewhat pretentious direction and cinematography the story is vapid on purpose but the storytelling is excellent thanks to quentins skillsnow my problem is that ok its fun but then what has tarantino so little ambition that hes unable to put some real substance into his films does he really only wants to be an entertainerand why does he have to quote so many directors he quotes so much that his own style is almost absent from the movie and what with depalma why are references to brians style all over the place in i dont get itive read so many critics here saying that depalma is all style and no substance and mimicks hitchcock now comes a tarentino that openly copies depalmas visual style and cinematic tricks and has no substance whatsoever except in jackie brown the only tarantino movie that has real guts whatever all you fans think and hurra make way for the new genious pahpop culture is a strange thing nowadaysstill a very entertaining and funny movie but not great breathtaking groundbreaking cinema no way far too superficial and gratuitous,cruel
let me just say that i have never been a big fan of tarantino from the start so dont let my comments get to you too much tarantino has always been and still is clueless what amazes me is how high a ranking this movie has at imdb tarantino never was and is not a fan of martial arts films but more importantly he has no respect for the martial arts genre nor for the asian culture i truly feel that is a result of mr tarantino watching a few martial arts films then cashing in on the matrix influence ie american public now loves martial arts fighting all i can give him credit for is finding a good martial arts director thats it now before all you tarantino fans go ballistic on me let me explain my disgruntlement tarantino claims to have paid homage and tribute to many genre including spaghetti western and martial arts films in but i ask just how do you pay homage to a genre when you are insulting it case in point tarantino lumps chinese and japanese into one genre and one culture anyone with half interest in martial arts or asian films will tell you that they are completely different there are obvious references to bruce lee uma thurman is wearing a yellow jump suit with a black stripe as does bruce lee in the game of death she fights the final battle in a japanese garden as does bruce lee in the chinese connection in fact i am nearly positive that the garden in is exactly the same as the garden in the final battle scene in chinese connection but to have this image of bruce lee fight in the samurai style is sheer ignorance and idiocy having a chinese icon fight in a japanese style is like having a jew fight with a swastica banner engraved on hisher chest it just doesnt make sense most asian nations were oppressed by the japanese before ww2 and chinese connection explicitly depicts this oppression turning it around and having the hero in this case uma thurman who is obviously suppose to represent bruce lee fight in the style of the enemy is a complete insult perhaps if you are not familiar with martial arts and the identity and the genealogy from which it spawns and what it means to the culture i can give you a glimpse of the magnitude of the insult by saying something like rap music was invented by vanilla ice get the pointi guess ever since tarantino made a fool of himself at the mtv movie awards by constantly saying jackie chans name incorrectly my esteem of him as a director but more importantly as an intelligent individual plunged like a 747 on fire but this tribute to martial arts film is the icing on the cake i love action films i always have and always will fight club the matrix and every jet li films will always have a place in my movie librarybut this hodgepodge confused ripoff of a film is not anywhere near the classic status that has been given by the members of imdb furthermore it seems that a vast majority of the people here believe that if you copy one movie its a ripoff but if you copy a dozen movie its a tribute well now i know the magic formula my next movie will be obiwon will be searching for the lost ark but is opposed by the mummy and scorpion king so has to go to the godfather for help but since the godfather has been killed by the joker obi looks for help from conan the barbarian who is currently in battle with aliens,cruel
vol1 reminds me of bruce lees enter the dragon quentin tarantino even uses a female version outfit as bruce in enter the dragon the brutal violent sword slashing plus wonderful music made this movie different and entertaining kung fu action adviser yun wo ping didnt give this movie as much action as in the matrix the cartoon part in 1 was a little too much snow fight scene with lucy liu was beautiful but lacks great actions possibly both actor arent real action actors over all its still a good 2 hours of bloody slashing fun did i mention the wonderful music quentin tarantino always does a great job chosing music in his moviesthe resovior dogs  pulp fiction still my favorite quentin tarantino movies7 out of 10,cruel
there have been many people who have tried to copy tarantino and failed for one very simple reason he is not a good story teller or film makerin this movie it is seen more clearly than in any other movie taking ideas from martial movies he parodies them without any understandingthe characters lack depth and so do the fight scenes they are embarrassing insults to the original masterpeices that he likes so much it is painfully obvious that he likes and admires these film making styles but does not understand them yet tarantino is one of my favourite film makers because he likes acts and he likes actors to act he brings something out in that other directors can not do the dialog and film making is bad enough to not distract from actors taking overly simple characters he is prepared to stand back and let them act here is where is genius lies this is why no one has been able to copy him,cruel
i gonna be frank i didnt like itdont get me wrong if you like some of tarantinos techniques and so on go ahead enjoy but if youre like me and i like some of tarantinos work no ill rephrase i like all his movies until now what i loved about his movies is the humour and smart conversations ive always ment that his strength is in his dialogue and i think if you look at his previous movies you get the dealive seen my share of violent movies and you there comes a time when you kinda grow up its not that funny anymore then youll appreciate movies with a good story acting and so on and this story well its thinner then an anorexic cheerleader but hey what do i know its probably ment to be this way and i respect the fact that its inspired by the 7080s kungfu movies like shogun assassinlady snowblood and so on but where is the great dialogue the humour the intricate plotso in the end im probably one out of a hundred but ill give it a 610,cruel
was watchable as far as it went with david carradine in it sort of it felt like watching a souped up version of kung fu or the dukes of hazzard you know  some daft 70s thing with lucy lu in it  ie charlies angels that also made me feel like this which was good i liked the film for thishowever the next day i watched who am i the jackie chan film now there is a kung fu movie most of the baddies in this are not actors they are genuine kung fu fighters and kick boxers and watching jackie and these guys knock sevenbells out of each other makes you realise what a whole load of hollywood posturing nonsense was dont make actors do kung fu they cant do it and they look silly,cruel
the world should rightly love quentin tarantino great director who merges his favorite things in cinema and makes them his ownliked reservoir dogs and jackie brown a lot and loved pulp fiction but i my humble opinion vol 1 doesnt pass his previous efforts in my opinion i think its just that the story doesnt excite me martial arts is not my favorite genre by a long stretch and this film has a hell of a lot of itbut everything is there for volume to be liked by the masses710,cruel
this is art  give me a breakif qt wanted to accomplish something remotely close to what i feel he was trying to do he should have viewed the old  man without a name  trilogyas it isthis movie is pretty damn horriblethe scenes jump around like an add mtv rap video geared to fans of old  chop socky movies  with alot of gorethe main characters arent even likableuma thurman as an exhitman  lordythats not even close enough to be considered palatablethe three things i feel really killed this movie were as follows  1  hitmen are not the most emotionally exorbitant people in the worldif someone did plan revenge on a fellow colleague the whole world wouldnt know about it until they were already stone cold deadits not believable that a professional killer would change tactics regardless of what happened to himhernot too logical or efficient 2  there is no way in hell anyone outside of japanese heritage would ever run the yakuzaperiodespecially a womanunless there was an emergencyas when shindos anesan  his wife  took over for him while he was in jail this is as ridiculous as when daredevil featured a black man as the kingpin of crimethis isnt a racial statement peopleits just that the criminal element doesnt mix race or gender very wellits kind of like a white guy running a jamaican drug cartelnever happen on this planet3 she sat in a guys car  the guy she killed  for 13 hours yet the cops didnt come outside to look at the car after they found the two bodies  suresureand im the king of englandgive me a breakhow this bad of a movie could crack the top 100 blows the mindthen againconsidering the lack of widespread intelligence in the world it shouldnt surprise mesome much for morality and good tastethe difference between kung pow and this movie  kung pow was intentionally funny  out of tenpoor movieview at your own risk,cruel
natural born killers meets crouching tiger hidden dragonhow is this in the imdb top 250 ohnever mindall the under 18 year olds voted 100 looks likenow that qt can make whatever movie he wants he pukes this out nothing but self indulgent tripe and enough with the closeups of umas ugly toes ok quentin thanksim a fan of classic samurai and kung fu theater with lots of wire work but the fighting in this with few exceptions is terrible i wont go into details but see if you can find a classic samurai flick like sword of doom and compare the action,cruel
a crazy blonde lady  kills 88 guys with kato masks carrying swords yet she struggles so much to beat lucy liu and vivica fox this film takes everything from anime flicks and 70s martial arts films the film has absolutely no originality  to it what so everits so cliche its not funny the plot is dull the acting is cheesy as for umas character i didnt like her at all and didnt care what happened to her she is a self absorbed arrogant cold blooded killer and i hope she gets offed in vol 2 i dont see why people liked this movie i really dont and im betting im not the only one who feels this way qt is an idiot his films are just mindless killing with no character or story development i feel absolutely no sympathy for the characters so why continue watching it makes me hurl when people call this movie an artistic masterpiece how is it artistic its just killing blah 110,cruel
hii enjoyed although i have a few questions regarding the references to the martial arts used in the film1 hattori hanzo was a renowned ninja who lived late 1800s ninjas were a lower class to the samurai most of which were assassins and spies  they disregarded honour  in most cases  in favour of getting a job done they also did not respect the katana like the samurai did  why is sonny chibas character called hattori hanzo to me  probably due to my lack of understanding  calling the character hattori hanzo is a pretty weak reference as the character in the film is so unlike the real person2 how does the bride become so efficient with the katana  although saying that the sword does look to heavy for uma but thats beside the point  all we have seen so far is that chinese dude kung fu master training her again probably due to my lack of understanding but how can a chinese kung fu master teach a japanese sword art  ie kenjutsu  its stupid3 not a martial arts question but doesnt bushido teach that if your master  ie bill  wants you out of the picture you get out of the picture ie become a ronin or cut your stomach open  seppeku was a common thing in japan during the days of the samurai or so we are told  and if the bride had any sense of honour or being a samurai she should have either taken her own life or just left things alone  this being a revenge picture choosing the samurai code of honour to base the brides actions on is just plain wrong  anyway if she knew anything about the samurai code of honour she should have gone straight for bill and taken control of the vipers herself if the other members had any sense of honour  oren for example as she makes such a song and dance about being a samurai  they would have followed the bride4 what has bruce lee got to do with anything why do the yakuza sport kato masks why does the bride sport a yellow track suit so far we have seen no kung fu or gung fu in the film so why reference bruce lee aside from being a massive star in the martial arts genre bruce lee has nothing to do with what we see in again it just seems like a weak reference based purely on lees star factor5 oren mocks the bride trying to be like a samurai silly white girl trys to fight like a samurai isnt oren half chinese samurai are japanese families oren was not born into a samurai family neither was the bride so isnt oren playing samurai like the bride  if i type samurai one more time ill explode theres loads more questions i have but iv ranted on long enoughcheerschris,cruel
let me just get one thing clear ive never liked quentin tarantino ever since i saw as much as i could bear of the horrendous resiviour dogs a film which for some reason is judged a masterpiece i didnt think id see another film of his again but hearing about i thought the man would pleasently suprise me but no yet again it is juts another film which consists of nothing but a bloodsplatter fest verging on the pornagraphicnow dont get me wrong i have no problem with violent films die hard the terminatoretc these films i have no problem with but dogs and just have scene after scene of gore which i really got utterly bored of i stopped both films before the end as i really was tried of it tarantino has to be the worst director ever uma thurman and the music score are the only two good things about ,cruel
whilst leaving the cinema after viewing i heard a guy in the row in front of me say hes lost it a bit hasnt he he took the words right out of my mouth i still find it hard to believe that someone who made quality movies like pulp fiction and jackie brown could possibly be guilty of making such an awful movie people say that tarantino spent several years watching kung fu movies before he made so how come he ended up making a samurai style movie there is a big difference between the two genres but to be honest this movie shouldnt count as martial arts full stop for a start there are no quality martial artists playing the main characters and thats always going to be a problem the movie spends a lot of time covering the same old ground the quirky sound track the over stylistic approach there is nothing new here the levels of violence may have increased but surely only the most dim witted of people would rate a movie just on the number of killings they seemany critics are raving about this movie at the moment but i feel it has a faddy kind of appeal its one of those movies that people blow out of proportion just because they like the previous work of tarantino i dont feel they are judging it purely on what they see at the cinemadvd i hope tarantino can do better than this in the future because up until this i was a big fani rate this movie  5 out of 10 in future leave this genre to those who know what they are doing,cruel
here we have quentin tarantinos latest attempt at the success he had with pulp fiction this movie was so awful i should have asked for my money back and in fact by federal law they must refund your money maines implied warranty actthe combat scenes were such slapstick they just ruined the moviefor anyone with an iq over whats average 100110 this is a hard salebut thats average meaning the majority of our population falls within that measure so he had no trouble finding an audiencethe story was good but just here and there could have used work overall i cant bash the storyline nice work quentin and umabut quentin soon you will have this reputation with real movie fans as a b movie maker that makes sty b movies thats not goodonly lack of an imagination could have you liking or buying into this movie its so awful the action scenes just ruined it overallthe scene where luci lui gets the top of her head cut off yet her brain is exposed is just stupid i mean suspension of disbelief is a given for any movie but for those of use with over half a brain you are asking too much end of storydude just break down and make a prequal to pulp fiction i mean at least stick with what you know keep the slapstick out of martial arts movies because i think they are a genre you could really be successful in,cruel
now long id say at least ten yearsqt has given us another gem he combines a classic revenge story with a pastiche of the kung fu movies he grew up onthe only weakness is in the backstory with the exception of lucy lius character we know nothing of the other characters pasttarantino wisely pushes such things to the back burner we know that bill and his assassins killed nine innocents and nearly killed the bridethere it is she has no name the only time she mentions her name in part 1 it is bleeped and again an moment later when viveca a fox says the name she doesnt need a name she isnt a person so much as a force of naturethere are two main setpieces the brides fight with vernita green viveca a foxand the big battle at the house of blue leaves both are intense and will leave you limpnot enough goodies on the dvd though sighnine stars watch the dvd then go watch part 2,cruel
i like quentin i really do i respect his love for the genres that influenced him and i completely support his desire to actively pay homage to these genres through his movies all three of his movies before did that and i loved them but i didnt love them because of some injokes they were making that cinephiles were all over and i didnt love them because of the almostcasual way violence and depravity are shown in them his first 3 movies are good because of characters that are interesting and human even if they inhabit some kind of alternate fantasy reality dialogue thats snappy and amusing and plots intricate and well edited that and his raw ability as a director of coursewell 1 has no shortage of the latter and the injokes and cartoonish and cartoon gore fly in your face nonstop but this movie has no heart this movies characters have no heart the dialogue sure as hell has no heart and frankly  though im sure this is on purpose  the acting is equally lifeless this film has action galore all of which is well done though not particularly memorable and thats the only thing it really has going for itthe story is dead simple not a bad thing in itself the bride an expressionless uma thurman is gunned down with her entire party during her wedding even though shes pregnant the culprits are the other 5 members of the assassination squad she was formerly a part of headed by bill himself whom we hear but dont see in vol 1 bill shoots the bride in the head but she survives and later wakes up from a coma understandably ped off she decides to kill those that wronged her and anyone else to come in her waythe rest of the movie is about the bride killing 2 of the 5 assassins the barelypresent vivica a fox and oren ishii lucy liu whos given an extensive backstory both through anime and normal expositionso uma 1 gets shot 2 wakes up 3 goes to japan to build a sword 4 fights oren and helpers 5 fights  uh vivica granted this is told a bit out of sequence for no discernible reason unlike say pulp fiction but this really is the gist oh and orens backstory is shown in very gory anime form the rest is reserved for volume 2with a story like that thered better be something to keep us entertained yes well the dialogue is atypically empty for some reason quentins usual profanity sounds ridiculously fake in the vivicauma confrontation the characters are all ruthless evil bastards even the bride really oren would be cool but read on and theres a lot of swordfighting the thing that youll notice right away is that gallons of blood spurt everywhere from open wounds people are split every which way most of this is so overthetop you wont be grossed out or particularly moved by it some of the violence however goes into seriousslashermovie territory while in a few others moments the serious tone of the movie is combined with a ridiculous moment of gore to make one feel quite uneasy about enjoying it that kind of thing did nothing for me other than make feel uncomfortable and if a film is supposed to be lighthearted fun as youd think about this one at times feeling annoyed should not be part of the deal never decides what it wants to be when it comes to violence and perhaps thats the directors intention but the mood of the action is uneven enough to make me feel ambivalent about the action itself to see what i mean note the anime segment the end of the oren fight and the end of the gogo fight at one point the top of a characters head is chopped off in graphic detail on screen at an extremely extremely inappropriate moment emotionally this sort of fate should be reserved for expendable drones maybe but not a principal characterthe action is solid enough that i might give this one a 6 or a 7 but all the annoying stuff is enough to rate it down to 510note i dont care if vol 2 is better this movie came out on its own and it feels kind of like the first episode of a tv miniseries and thats fine its not that it feels incomplete as many say its just a weak episode,cruel
it appears that many people do not have a full grasp of the types of films that quentin tarantino is involved in if some one went to see vol 1 and expected a classic martial arts film or a serious drama or action coated eye candy then they would not have been greeted with what they expected tarantino is famous for his dark humor sometimes it is a little too dark and too subtle that is why the people that like him love him and the people that do not like his work generally do not understand him his humor is often so subtle a good majority of his audience does not pick it up i myself do not understand many things that go on in his movies or why they happened however i often find myself chuckling to myself regardless perhaps this is part of tarantinos appeal in his ability to leave people in the dark about so many things and let his audience draw their own conclusions in the case of there is the matter of the cheap blood the long anime scenes the beep over umas name etc we do not understand why these things happen but many must admit they were strangely entertained by ever odd occurrence it is fun for things to be left for the audience to ponder and let their own imaginations run wild that is why we all love pulp fiction reservoir dogs and jackie browngo quentin tarantino,cruel
its a quentin tarantino movie so i expected the usual over the top violence its also a ninja movie so physics and reality go right out the window as expected yes skinny uma thurman apparently can take on a room of 50 ninjas yes an 11 year old japanese girl can in fact revenge kill a middle aged man yes rail thin uma can in fact lift a 150 lb japanese man over her head on her sword thats the kind of movie this is and apparently people who love asian movies really dig this stufftheres also the usual dregs of society that tarantino likes to explore for some reason while uma is in a coma apparently her male nurse had sex with her and also lets his friend take a turn on her for cash fine if tarantino wants to drag up this kind of perversion in his films i guess thats his prerogativehowever she is in a coma for 4 years having just woke up then for some reason pretending to be asleep when she hears her nurse she swiftly kills the 300 lb friend who is attempting to rape her then when the 260 lb nurse comes in later she kills him by slamming his head in a door jamb repeatedly apparently rail thin uma can take him on even though she was in a coma for four freaking years and when the beating begins apparently he just decides to lay there rather than like defend himself or crawl awayanyway its great hollywood marxist stuff lots of groin slicing off emasculation and that kind of thing so if you can suspend rational logic and your belief in physics and you dont mind a plot that is pretty weak and you like pretty pictures then you might like this film,cruel
this is a great film to watch however beyond two viewings it gets dull it is a one trick pony that is very well filmed but i dont notice it improving on multiple viewings in fact i cant see watching it more than once on dvd so i wont be buying the dvd vol ii looks like it will be pretty lousy which explains why tarantino knew he couldnt keep us sitting through what is basically the same routine over imagine uma fighting a 60 year old david carradine whats he gonna do throw out his false teeth at her other than being a pretty severe drunk in his offtime what does carradine do exactly i loved the movie the first time i saw and liked it the second time the third time will be a snore,cruel
umm was this supposed to be serious this film was so full offiller filler filler filler filler filler filler cheese i couldnt help but laugh all the way through it please tell me it was a comedy,cruel
as the muchheralded fourth film by quentin tarantino vol i is at best or by definition merely an incomplete storyalthough tarantinos loyal legion of fans waited years for this filmthey unfortunately were rewarded with this halfbaked project  anhomage to the asian grind house cinema of the 1970s and 80sadmittedly this film has some brilliant cutscenes and was shotwith the same cinematic intensity as tarantinos earliermasterworks although thematically it is really more closelyrelated to true romance a film which he penned but did notdirectlike true romance the plot of revolves around anantihero who is betrayed and then spends the rest of the filmplotting her revenge in this role uma thurman turns in a careerperformance  perhaps her best since her last appearance in atarantino project 1994s pulp fictionspeaking of casting tarantino offers a few brilliant choices here as he often seems to do  resurrecting longforgotten screen idolsand highlighting upandcoming talents david carradine plays thetitle character and focus of thurmans venom in the film darrylhannah returns from hollywood exile for a brilliant cameoreminiscent of her villainous turn in blade runner vivica fox ismemorable as an assassinturnedsoccer mom and michaelmadsen also returns as one of tarantinos favorite bad guys theone lackluster casting choice here is lucy liu who has a rathertypecast role as a badass martial arts mastercinematically tarantino is on his game here offering forays intovarious genres such as revenge film road film samurai film andeven anime unfortunately for the viewer the sum is less than thecollected parts as each setpiece stands well enough alone butfails to blend togetherironically if miramax studio head harvey weinstein had left wellenough alone would have been an epic 2andahalfhour genrebasher worthy of the rabid praise being heaped uponit by his legion of fans as well as placing it among one of the bestaction films of the past decade unfortunately greedy marketingtactics led to this wouldbe great film being whacked into twoparts although there is nothing either new or wrong with cinematicserialization it worked well enough for the lord of the ringstrilogy  in this case it is an unwelcome artifice providing acliffhanger ending to vol i which tarantino never intended tohaveas a result i considered giving vol i an incompletegrade but i believe a more proper score is 4 out of 10  just likethe film itself i took the grade of 8 which i would have given it andcut it in half i will likely give vol ii the other 4 points when it comes outwait a minute  i just thought of something  does that make volii the fifth film by quentin tarantino ah well another debate foranother time,cruel
i didnt like it sorry for my rigidity but neverthelessthis movie is surrealistic it is not even the movie in the fact but some authors fantasy about not sure about what the story that can be represented in one sentence they almost killed me now ill kill em all has been farfetched just to have a reason to refer to this stuff as a movie rather than some unformed set of video clips second volume as it appears to me will not bring any answers to any questions actually the questions should not be risen here at all who cares who the bill is and why he did what he did just check out uma the brutal fightertechnical performance is good there were a several scenes that probably look doubtful but they can be attributed to grotesque movie style however i cannot evaluate the style by itself without any base yes this is definitely tarantinos hand but theres nothing written with this handwriting action thats fine but what about the plot intrigue so i was candidly boring during prolonged bloody slaughterthat is my humble opinionps moreover i had a strong feeling that it was just a handout from the master who is absolutely certain that it will be accepted by people anyway due to epidemic japonism passion or any other reason perfectly made the master but no more than a handoutpps generally there was the only scene that i was impressed with in the very beginning when the bride and the copperhead stop fighting and hide their knives behind the backs while the copperheads little daughter is coming in that was really tarantinos kind of thing,cruel
first i have to say that i do quite enjoy qts previous movies with the exception of from dusk to dawnmy gut reaction to this film was absolute horror and revulsion  i didnt think it was all bad  yes there are some brilliant transitions in the homages to different styles of film making but come on  the dialogue was the worst ever  uma thurman cant act and qt knows this and covered it up with bloody goreat least pulp and dogs had clever dialogue good acting and a sense of humourfor those who say that this is brilliant i want you to think about two small things  if you think it was brilliant because all the cool people say so you need to get a brain  secondly think about the styles he was copying there is no message in those that violence is bad or that they are making a commentary on real life  neither is true of either  i will not be wasting 12 bucks on vol 2310,cruel
i went with my girlfriend so all the time i was worried about what she thought of it especially as she kept telling me what she thought of it maybe id have enjoyed it more without that worryeven so i think it was too simple it was just fight after fight there was no sub plot in most films when a key piece of action is over you go to a different story for a while for a rest in this when a fight was over they just stared at each other for a bit with music playing and then the next fight started so there was only one story and it was a very thin one the bride kills lots of people in revenge thats it thats the entire story theres no suspense you know wholl win the fight its not like nightmare on elm st et al where the interest is in seeing people die in lots of different imaginative ways there is only one way they are killed with a sword thats it 110 mins of people being killed with swords in virtually the same way over and over it is extremely violent but to counteract that he keeps reminding you that its not real by going into cartoon or black and white which makes it even less involving more like watching a pop video reservoir dogs was great because of all the talk the violence wasnt what it was about this had very little dialog he was making a hollywood version of a japanese samurai film but most of the dialog was in japanese anyway so why bother it wasnt even high budget so it was just like seeing the films it was a homage to on the good side it reminded me of the good the bad and the ugly taking its time lots of atmosphere and style but you could have walked out after 15 mins and walked back in 15 mins before the end and you wouldnt have missed anything,cruel
no dramatic coherence of any kind thats the main difference between this film and the three earlier tarantino films well as well as the crappy dialogue that cannot be compared to great pulp fiction or res dogs dialogue what the hell happened to this guy did he loose his touch this movie results in a semi jackie chan semi hot shots type of film a big let down,cruel
films like vol 1 rock your otherwise normal and conformist world with deathdefying elements that will keep you tense excited interested and definitely intrigued quentin tarantinos fourth featurelength production is a bloodbath of whacked situations reminiscent of 1950sstyled asian action flicks and 1960s70s european film noir pulp garbage that all mixes and meshes to one of the most invigorating and intense cinematic experiences of the past three decades an assassin uma thurman is gunned down in a desolate church just outside of el paso texas by five fellow killers the never seen but always heard david carradine in the titled role michael madsen vivica a fox daryl hannah and lucy liu for unclear and unexplained reasons thurman about to be married also watched helpless as everyone else in the church was killed mercilessly four years pass and thurman has been stuck in a coma and actually dodged death as an attempt on her life was strangely aborted of course thurman pops out of it at the most convenient of moments and her only thoughts are of revenge on those aforementioned players who tried unsuccessfully to take her down thurmans quest takes her to suburban america where she finds housewifemotherlittle league coach fox and even to tokyo where she tracks down underworld crime boss liu keep in mind though that tarantino has never cared for chronology or production order so naturally he would rather leave those methods at the door thus the film goes forward back pauses and even goes from color to blackandwhite on occasion the effects may be dizzying but may also win you over in a wickedly intelligent way vol 1 is a thrillride that matches very well with tarantinos earlier works even though this is arguably his weakest effort tarantino also smartly took a page away from the lord of the rings trilogy by splitting this saga into two parts this project began as one very long epic film samuel l jackson once said that tarantino was the best he had ever seen at stealing other peoples ideas and changing them just enough to make a completely new concept this is very evident here as tarantino even uses that cheaplooking exploitation angle and further advances the picture with a crazed asianstyled toonami sequence that somehow seems more poetic than pathetic the movie is ultraviolent but does not fall to shock value or silly teenagestyled slasher clichs the main reason is the dynamite performance by thurman and tarantinos secondtonone direction tarantino is kind of like the dennis rodman of hollywood everyone either loves or hates him you can either let yourself be sucked in by his brilliant creativity or you can be repulsed by his risktaking and obvious bad boy attitude towards the medium while still not a perfect movie vol 1 delivers a darkly funny and exhilarating experience that will keep you awake if nothing else 45 out of 5 stars,cruel
for real people how often does movies like this appear can you remember the last time you had such good humored fun as in volume 1 movies today take themselves far too seriously like the matrix sequels or the incredible hulk or such,cruel
funny i registered purely in order to write this review which isnt really a review rather a comment on how people are seeing this movie  there are spoilers but before we get to those i want to say something to all those who are going to see this movie  the truth is in order to enjoy this movie or even understand it you need to free yourself of your preconceptions of what film is and get back to the basics  film is in its purest essence a fine art and it tries to do what all fine arts try to do convey the desired emotion  plot mise en scene soundtrack  these are devices and it is my opinion that qt as he is afectionately referred to here is in full mastery of all these elementsok now im going to talk about the movieso far there have been these complaints  it is too slow  there is no plot which isnt true but the plot is very simple so it gives off that impression  there is too much violencegore  the editing is annoying and in the end it really just comes down to what is all the hype aboutand the truth is all these things are right on or at least right to a point  the plot is very simple compared to all of qts other movies except maybe from dusk till dawn and i know he only wrote that but it still counts  it is slow  the editing is troublesome at points  there is an immense amount of gore in fact a cartoonish amount you start to wonder if there is really that much blood in the human bodywhat makes the movie so great is that all these things are purposefulthey are all tools for the end result which if you stand back and take a look at it is quite monumental  the plot is simple because the brides existence is centered around a single point  avenge her daughter her husband and herself  the simple plot thus thrusts us the viewer into that sort of single pointedness  likewise all the other elements of the story fit together in that sort of fashionof course the fact that these parts of the story work together wouldnt by themselves make this a great movie  rather its greatness comes from the fact that at heart this is a cartoon which takes itself with utmost seriousnessand in the end it deserves it  a wedding is destroyed seemingly without reason  a young child has her family murdered before her eyes and she needs to sleep her way to the top of a japanese gang at 11 years old in order to get her revenge  a coma patient is pimped out over and over again for over four years to anonymous clients  this is what makes up in essence it needs the cartoonish elements to even make it watchablebut the movie isnt about happiness  the movie isnt even really about the plot  rather its about all the little scenes tha tmake your spine tingle like when the bride tells very evenly to vernita green get even  even steven  no noid have to kill you  then id have to go upstairs and kill your daughter  then id have to wait here till your husband the doctor comes home and kill him  that would be even  that would be about square  or when hattori hanso says i say with no pride this is the finest sword i have ever made  if god shoudl come across your path you should cut him down  or when the bride wakes up from her coma and realises that shes not pregnant anymore and she completely breaks down  i cant remember being that sad in a long timeno the real greatness of the movie comes from all the little lines that sparkle all the little glances that rob your attention blind  the litle siren sound whenever the bride sees an old freind  the way she calmly claims all the body parts she removed from her victims in the house of the blue leaves  even the somewhat operatic opening credit sequence where they introduce the entire cast of the movie and what parts they playand of course the action scenes kick ass,cruel
this movie doesnt live up to the hype at all ok the scenes are beautifully shot the martial arts are great the music is very good the references are interesting butthe story is very thin and the violence is really over the top maybe people are desensitized and need this kind of violence to feel again i feel sorry for that is it necessary to show it to underscore the enormous anger and revenge of the leading character i dont believe so i prefer reservoir dogs en pulp fictionless shallow and more complete510,cruel
just noticed that almost 12 half voters gave this a 10 im dumbfounded it has great martialarts fight scenes and the plot would be pretty interesting if it were actually developed but there just isnt that much to this movie very over hyped i give a 4 and typically im a great tarrantino fan,cruel
wiggle the big toe   spoilers includedthis is a very exceedingly artistic action movie of pure violence not for the tender hearts at all    ho haaa    what a movie  when i first saw the trailer for v 1 i had some doubts about tarantinos 4th installment tarantino is a god among gods of cinema reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown and finally the installment are his running legacy of pure talent and brilliance we all know the story is about umas revenge from her former roninassassins crew on the day of her marriage pregnant she falls in a coma and wakes up round four years from the incident nemesis is her soul fate the action scenes are so convincing that you soon are caught in the flame of this story about the grave journey our beautiful uma thurman lady warrior takes her revenge through a vengeance kill list its time to settle scores i loved this movie i loved umas performance she is no dumb blond on the road but a tough convincing warrior who honors the code the movie is as great and enchanting as the mighty hattori hanzo sword the great sonny chiba is hanzo the retired sword master who meets the brides uma dangerous vermin with a hand made cutting edge swordvermin noun 1 vermin  an irritating or obnoxious person varmint bad person  a person who does harm to others  2 vermin  any of various small animals or insects that are pestsumas is breath taking in this wicked action experience her shoots are so clear her attitude in place humor around physically able to perform spectacular sword fighting scenes she is a queen i salute her for her g globe best actress nomination and wish that such time and effort put in the brides character mustnt pass unrewarded  as for the king him self tarantino he has done it again still amazing proving that a film is nothing more than a cool story good script bunch of potential talents and the mind that directs them he did succeed in bringing his long time dream of making a kung funinja cult piece the blood and violence is elevated a notch but tarantino delivers his black fades and black and white cameras to comfort us and relieve us of excess also tarantino manages to improve his work by smoothing out the scenes not making it slow as his former masterpieces but in fact accelerates i can still hear the sword clash in my head the sound score and tracks are in place you can touch the relation of this movie with quentins true romance story where various scenes include samurai sword fightsi think that sergio leone would have been proud of tarantinos talent to bring back those very old entertaining movies from the golden age of cinemamanga animations mighty bloody humor lots of swords and a mind blowing end cant wait to watch volume 2put in mind that this is no charlies angels movie its a juicy dose of artistic adrenaline 810 with a smile on thy face ,cruel
all the way through the film i found myself saying so what i didnt care about anything that happened in it i wasnt let down because i had high expectations from all the positive reviews and i love the genre that it was paying homage to nothing either drew me in or repelled me it was a film that played and then i left the cinema with absolutely no feelings about it at all,cruel
one thing i knew to be sure after 1992 and till now  all earth could go to hell bet tarantino never had lack of realism now with vol1 i can tell that he has lost his bite the film itsel if flawless  directing and acting is great and tarantino chapters resemble the famous pf but the problem is with the plot  the best way to kill blll could be ten times easier and less risky that one black mamba had chosen why rush into the copperheads house when she sucpects nothing and could be easy shot through window with a sniper rifle if black mamba wanted to have her fun with copperhead using knife why not didnt she use soprofic ammo or something beforeand then repeat the famous scene from reservoir dogs considering the fact that she was a pro this whole attitude lacks motivationof course you can motivate it with the postcoma shock bet not the whole movieshe had at least 3 months to recover basing on the plot another stupid thing to do was to get into fight with all the 88 elite guards cos in real life noone could really take on so  many enemies using only sword and win and if those guards were elite why none of them has a gun what kind of protection are they if a team of 34 guys equipped with machineguns entered the building in real life the mad88 would make an easy thargets but even with swords they could easlily chop mamba only because they were to many and you just cant move that fast unless you are the one so here comes another drawback  lack of originality tarantino definetely tried to copy both the matrix reloaded and classic takeshi kitano even by having actors from battle royale in his movie  scenes its not that bad at all considering that the reservoir dogs were fully based on kitanos violent cop but qt failed to give the blood and gore fest which i greatly appreciated the charm and style which ruled in rdogs and some corny anime and huge ammount of japanese dialoguewhich is organic in kinatnos movies but pointless in tarantinos are terrible so the only really tarantinostyled scenes are some dialogues like between copperhead and mamba catchphrases like im buck im here to f and so on 810 because of lack of style and realism,cruel

qt here has once again showed his knack for creating fleeting absurd characters over the top action scenes and original adaptation from various genres in qt picks the main genre anime to bring to life on the big screen if this film were done in pure cartoon anime it would just be another japanese anime flick but here we have anime without the cartoonexcept for a few brief momentsthe violence depicted here is absurd and over the top exactly what we would see in many cartoon anime series it is not intended to shock it is intended to stay true to the anime genre as if we were watching a true cartoon animeuma thurman aka the splattered bride aka black mamba aka her absurdly bleeped out true name of beatrice is on your typical anime plot based revenge march from an assassination attempt on her 4 years prior in typical out of sequence qt we see the first act of vengeance only after to get qta quick and fleeting foundation to the story the reason for beatrices revenge however we do not know the reason for the hit squads hit on black mamba the film is interesting and visually stunning but lacks in depth character development but is not not typical qt and why we like his filmsspoiler did anyone listen to black mamba start to proclaim to bill its your baaab then pow maybe thats why bill wanted her dead jealously we shall see in volume 2 of this anime revisited genre8 out of 10ps dont take your children or ever allow them to see this film unless you want you kid to have nightmares for months,cruel
ive expected lot of blood everywhere and almost no story at all so hard that i was kinda surprised that it wasnt that bad about the blood or the story either but never mind this movie wasnt about the story it was about style  style over substance the creative way of displaying otherwise already boring scenes and situations kept me enjoying among other things they were black and white scene where blood was obviously replaced with water animated scene retro music and the fight with bola anyway the strongest character for me was chiaki kuriyama as go go yubari her eyes were so wicked and her other features so sharp she was the only character that gave the skin crawland one more thing the violence wasnt gratuitous it was all exaggeration oh well was fun 810,cruel
well though having tarantino atop the credits is something that helps this movie has many details that make it much more than a good popcorn movielet me just mention a couple 2 very powerful onesfirst the japanese animation please go again to the theater wait for that scene and then feel it people there will be more stressed and involved than in almost any other movie you can recall and by the way the simple way the director not his name him put that scene into the story deserves a pointsecond all the introductory sequence to the last scene ie the way everybody walks in was it a restaurant sofies walk to the restrooms people dancing all that with the 3girlsband performance as a background with that very music boy that is a really powerful scenethe film of the century certainly not but believe me it is a veeery good popcorn moviei join the group i want to see the 2nd part,cruel
not much of a story but well executedyou know what the problem is with living in a small ass town in the southern part of the netherlands the problem is that if you are unable to attend a screening of a film like in its first two weeks no cinema within a 25 kilometer radius still has the film running on a big screen now thats what i call a problem and how is one supposed to solve that watch on a small ass screen sod that wait until it is released on video hell no so what does one do one travels about 85 kilometers to the first big town spends twelve bucks on the trainticket an additional 830 for the entrance fee in a multiplex far far away from home in conclusion one spends a hell of a lot of money and three hours on the train for about two hours of tarantino on a big screen when one has done all that what do one do then you guess well then one hopes that the film does not suck and let me tell you it doesntthe beginning of is quite rough and that sets the tone for the rest of the film which is constructed the same way as pulp fiction regarding the fact that the story is not told in its chronological form now i agree with the critics with the fact that does not have too much of a story but one can see that there is still much to come in volume ii not only is the brides kept secret from the audience but the really great and in also surprising ending hints at somewhat more story and more surprises in the second filmi must say that i am a fan of tarantinos work as a director and i found it astonishing that even with this film he managed to surprise me for is unlike any of his other films it bears somewhat a resemblance with jackie brown with which q dived deeply into another genre of moviemaking and that is exactly what he does with is a martial arts revenge film with spaghetti western and anime influences that i must say he mixed astonishingly well despite having a bit of a with the animated chapter in the film myself in the beginningthe music in the film is once again great and the characters although not all are elaborate and some seem quite shallow are characterized in a believable and good way by the actors besides uma thurman who portrays the bride i especially liked lucy liu as oren ishii the character she portrayed suited her very well and she pulled off the mean and devilish little godfather with style if lucy did a really good job i must say that uma ruled i mean she just acted in great fashion and i think this film is her best performance since pulp fiction maybe some would say that it is even better actingwise i do not want to be the judge on that and the only thing i can say is that she is as great as the bride as she was as misses mia wallace if you dont believe it watch the film and especially the wakeup scene if you dont think that is great acting youre probably still in the stallone is the best actor ever phasethe film itself yes you read and heard correctly everywhere is quite brutal with limbs flying around and blood gushing out of wounds as it does in manga films at times but the fact is that in my opinion it could have been and needed be much more brutal the thing i am referring to here is the massacre at the house of blue leaves i mean what the heck was q thinking when he made the switch from colored film to black and white or does this relate to the fact that the american and european version is much less violent than the asian version of the film is it all in color over there and did the film manage to get an r rating because the blood and killing were in black and white instead of being in color well i do not know but i had some real difficulty with the film switching to black and white and i think i would have enjoyed the killing more if it had been in color i guess ill see what that was all about when this film comes out on dvdthe carnage and destruction in never gets boring or ridiculous as it did in matrix revolutions and despite the fact that some things need getting used to volume i is a film that makes 110 minutes seem pretty short indeed i agree that there is not much of a story but then again the stories of reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were not too elaborate either the thing with tarantino is that his execution of a story is always topnotch including this film this film may not be as thrilling as reservoir dogs as cool as pulp fiction as complicated and mysterious as jackie brown but i sure as hell enjoyed myself and certainly did not regret having spent so much time and money since in the end i got something back as well i for one cant wait until 2004 when the bride will finally 75 out of 10post scriptum how did the bride knew it had been four years,cruel
uma thurman is the bride an assassin whose wedding day is ambushed by her former colleagues  she is left comatose by a bullet in her skull but she wakes four years later intent on revenge  she makes a death list number five is bill but first there are some others including oren ishi lucy liu to deal withthe film starts promisingly with the bride calling in at the house of a fellow assassin vivica fox  this is the most entertaining sequence of the film with some trademark tarantinoesque banter between the two women as they fightmy interest in the film disintegrated soon after with a lengthy sequence that introduces oren ishi and is entirely in the form of a manga style subtitled cartoon  i am still not sure whether the film sent me to sleep because after that i have no recollection of a coherent storyline  a flashback to the brides escape from hospital is mildly amusing but in a very black way   there is also a lengthy black and white sequence for the confrontation between the bride and oren ishis bodyguards  here i felt like i was watching a very violent computer game with lots of fighting and blood spurting from dismembered bodies  as is conventional with tarantino films the sequences are not chronological which makes quite a frustrating film to watch  although i find uma thurman a very watchable actress what this movie is lacking in is the witty banter between characters that made pulp fiction and jackie brown more enjoyablevolume 1 ends with an intriguing piece of information being revealed in anticipation of the story being continued in volume 2  perhaps i would like more and my opinion would be different if i were to view volume 2 on its release  unfortunately at this stage i feel that the six year wait for a new film by tarantino has hyped up the film more than it deserves and i increasingly feel that he is an overrated director so much so that i am inclined to wait until i can borrow the two disc dvd from someone,cruel

its difficult for me to judge this movie did i like it yes is it a good movie no i really liked pulp fiction and reservoir dogs not very sure about jackie brown and from dusk till down may be one of my all time favorites directed by robert rodriguez tough but where does this movie fails the problem is that it looks like a random mix of fight scenes taken from really bad hongkong movies the blood and guts look so fake and so funny that it can only be taken as a tribute to monty phytons holy grail the plot if any is so narrow that we dont even know who those people are or why they are fighting about i got tired of the action with no plot and my girlfriend got sick of watching that blinded violence in the end the film does not leave you anythingbut why did i like it because it entertained me a lot because is a nonstop action movie but then again a lot of bclass movies did the same so i will watch the second part but for tarantino this is his worst movie to date,cruel
this movies was exellent i liked every little aspect of it and i must admit that i used to talk s about trantino since now and forever ill recognize how good he is doing his stuffi liked all the explotation references the trix referencethe green hornet one and the bruce lee ones this movie has it all damn i had a great time at the movies today as a matter of fact i feel like a kid again i really want to watch it again im going to the theater one more time i guess its been a while since ive done that of watching the same movie on a movie theater as a matter of fact i did it on freddy vs jason but thats a whole other storyi loved oren and go go are my sweethaerts as crazy as they are i liked the house of blue leaves fight scene and the crazy 88 everything was cool i want to say to everyone that this movie is supposed to entertainthats itdont go around looking for what is coherent and whats notenjoyits only a moviehave fun ill definately give it a 10 out of 10 on revenge flicks,cruel
the blood escaped from the body like it was a fountain or how was uma able to take a samurai sword on an airplanethese comments kinda frustrates me if you didnt know this was supposed to be a tribute movie a tribute to all the film genres that quentin loves and especially of vol 1 that is the japaneese samurai genre and if you have seen a good old japaneese movie you will notice that the blood actually escapes the body like it was a fountainand for the samurai sword on the plane ive seen people writing it was a riddicoulus mistake by qt to oversee the fact that uma brought the sword with here on the plane from okinawa to japan do you really think qt oversaw that what it is is a tribute to japaneese samurai movies meaning samurai the sword and the movies and all it represents is such a important harritage to the japaneese people and culture that bringing a sword on the plane should be a normal and common thing to happen as you see on the plane seats there are actually copholders meant for the samurai swords to be held in or samuraiholders if youd likecongrats to qt for making a unforgettable movie yet again like his other movies he uses music so perfect in the movie shivre down my spines as a commenter of this movie said  ive seen it twice on the movies and i will buy the dvd1010 and a top10 ever spotsorry for the typeos,cruel
yes its a good movie it is worth watching tarantino provides an entertaining kung fu flick it is particularly fun to try and pick out all the nods to previous movies but it is certainly not the best of any genreneither is it really that violent yes there is more blood spraying and limb dismemberment than say love actually but its certainly not a gore movie so much so i was actually disappointedthe japanese version also is more violent having the final restaurant scene in color instead of black and whitebut in the quagmire of hollywood humdrum it certainly stands out610,cruel
is the longawaited new offering by quentin tarantino  six years in the making it attacks with no subtlety whatsoever  uma thurman stars as the bride and amazes in this tale of vengeance  her battle against go go yubari stands out among all the scuffling and bloodshed  the movie bears one of tarantinos trademarks a nonlinear story  this gives sonny chibas revenge is not a straight line speech a certain significance  another of tarantinos trademarks is graphic violence and offers plenty even more so than pulp fiction and reservoir dogs  the battle in the house of blue leaves is especially gory  after seeing the first half of quentins labor of love all i can say is brace yourself for volume 2,cruel
this film seems to be nothing more than a lame excuse for showing violence and while showing showers of blood way overdone really unrealistic and not even a bit funny it does almost everything wrong what a film can do wrong there is no acting at all save uma perhaps who at least changes the look on her face lucy liu for example is awful though pretty the idea of showing the plot not chronologically isnt new and one might get the feeling that this is tarantinos effort to link to pulp fiction in this case it doesnt work at all while the plot may reveal itself as quite a bit better than thought in vol2 who knows this part is just boringworst of all was imo the sound engineering something that is a flaw in a lot of films from the usa but this one takes the lead there were however some nice scenes regarding camera work but in battles as ridiculous as these that wont help too much speaking of the battles in matrix and star wars we got at least an explanation for what is happening in asian films flying swordfighters are something mythological here none of this applies and all we see is a 30year old women who spent her last four years in a coma and doesnt need even half a year before she moves like marvel super hero a little kryptonite would have helped,cruel
they told me this film was all style no substance well they were right about the substance  this film is devoid of plot humor character and dialogue which i cant comprehend because i figured that stuff was tarantinos forte then again redeeming quality supposedly is its style well the movie sure puts a lot of styles on display if thats the point tarantino borrows from various 70s flicks and drops references every five minutes but it all amounts to a very uneven tiresome movie that feels three times as long as it is the abundant violence to me was completely pointless unlike reservoir dogs for instance where the story  characters legitimize it i have tons of respect for tarantino but in this movie he simply forgets his audience i honestly cant remember when i left the theatre so disappointed,cruel
is just plain and simply the perfect revenge storyblack mamba has one plan revenge over the ones that killed her baby and put her in a coma the movie is brilliantly bloody and bloody brilliantdefinitely tarantinos best yet,cruel
this movie is awesomeits not the best movie ive ever seen but its what i consider by far the coolesti loved pulp fiction and reservoir dogs  i love japanese animation and culture  i love violent films that hold no punchesin this movie you get to see revenge  you get to see it really hardcore the way it should be dramatized  you get to see throwbacks to old bruce lee and kung fu films  you get a beautiful tale of revenge wrapped around homage to a genre that didnt mind if it was goofy in parts as long as the point got acrossits not pretty when you chop off a head or a leg but it most certainly is meaningfulthe characters are awesome  even characters whose names you dont become familiar with are excellently donethe movie was so cool that theres really no way for me to make it make sense to youpeople say its overrated these people like to think their opinion is golden and everyone elses isnt  they just want attention  direct your attention instead to this moviedont watch this movie if you are easily offended or if you dont like action sequences  if you hated pulp fiction this isnt for youthe choreography of music and action and cutsequences and dialogue in this movie has a masterpiece flavor to it  yes there are a couple parts that you can pick out and say this was done poorly in the action sequences however the fact that you would do that indicates that you should not ever return to a theater and waste your time or money  you missed all that beautiful stuff thats too hard to describe and let yourself grunt about a sillylooking sword sceneawesome cast perfect directing beautiful music well written script intelligent violent animation sequence perfect blend,cruel
having seen this three times at the cinema now i was inclined to write a review of it is quite easily one of the best films i have seen i was surprised i liked it so much as normally i am more keen on films with a complex narrative and developed charactersvolume ii may help clarify this nevertheless what delivered was a near perfect cinematic masterpiece the main reason i loved this film so much was because of its aesthetic qualities the violence looked almost beautiful a sharp contrast to that of reservoir dogs the film is very reflexive in so much that tarantino uses and appreciates a variety of subgenres thurman is perfectly cast as the avenger who seeks to torment and destroy those who inflicted so much pain on her its violence but tastefully donei cant wait for the second installment to arrive and answer some of the questions the first volume left open obviously i highly recommend this film but do understand it will not suit all tastes 1010,cruel
 make this a great film  my only seminegative about the film is that some of the fight scenes seemed a little matrixish at first but then the lights out effects won my attention back for the 9 seconds it was away looking forward to the second volume,cruel
friday night i watched the movie and just 4 words it just kicks ass the film is more controversal than the others from quentin in terms of violence but along with the anime scenes and the complete film plot it just rocksthe second kick ass thing is soundtrack well chosen tracks good compilation and fitting 1000 in the filmi cant await the 2nd part,cruel
this movie rocks on so many levels makes any other action movie look like a joke ive seen soo many action movies this one is hands down the best cant wait for the sequels go see it   11 out of 10    left the theater craaaavinnnng to see it again,cruel
what a rush as a fan of exploitation pictures for many years i greatly enjoyed this homage to all things groovy part of the rush for me is seeing a filmmaker adapting and allowing work that his influenced him to take new form from the opening shaw bros logo we know we are on the cinematic equivalent of 42nd street and its time to get our film freak on eastern kung fu flicks dominated this stretch alongside the soft and hardcore sex flix natchand this is a wonderful period of cinematic excess from which to drawfor me kb is about nobility of purpose both dark and white sides of an code of honour that binds all creatures plus having a candycoated shell of excess and style to shelter this theme the best b movies have this going for them if you can educate and entertain at the same time you have a rare opportunitykb does both with equal gusto you really need to be up on your grindhouse to dig all of the things qt has going on in kb as a fan and a filmmaker i was thrilled at seeing the rza master ping and the calibre of knb involved with this production you know these guys are fans artists and constant stellar performances from all involved onscreen and behind the camera tech credits are supersolidas far as movies go for me kb is the kungfu artploitation film of the decade nothing touches it i cant wait for kb2 and hope that qt is happy with his final work this fanboy is,cruel
i have loved tarantinos other films they have always had three key components a finely crafted story comedy and violence this film was exactly the same except that it didnt have the story or the comedythe film is only just over an hour and a half long but it seemed longer people clearly werent gripped i have never seen so many people wandering in and out of the cinema  they clearly werent on the edge of their seatsnow ive got nothing against violence if it moves the story forward or adds to the comedy i think the scene where vincent accidentally shoots a guy in the head in the back of a car is a great piece of comedy and directly leads to one of the best scenes in the excellent pulp fiction but the violence in is practically constant  and that gets very very dull theres only so many times that somebody getting slashed with a sword can hold your interestthe manga is quite well done but is again full of violence for violences sakethere is comedy but im pretty sure that the laughs were coming in places that the director didnt intendand the story well that must have taken all of five minutes to write victim of a failed murder goes out to kill the four assassins who attacked her and their boss bill cue five interminably long fight scenes two of which are in this movie linked by some violent  yawn background about each but because its tarantino the people are shown being killed in the wrong order innovative it is notof course tarantino is well known for his nonlinear films maybe the story and intelligent writing comes in part 2but i doubt it,cruel
tarantino loses himself in pointlessly stylish over the top action sequences and loses track of the flow of his film  i have rarely been as bored as during the action sequence at the end  the movie could have been a good one but tarantino tries to be more clever than he is and the movie wastes away as it progresses,cruel
is simply a bad movie plain and simple  theres very little substance to the plot no meaningful character development and a vast overabundance of senseless violence  the most unfortunate aspect of is that the trademark funkiness that has made tarantino a genre unto himself is almost entirely displaced by endless scenes of swordswinging limbamputating gore  in fact viewers will probably find the violence more boring than objectionable theres so much of itcontrary to the claims of diehard tarantino fans theres nothing to get about  theres no deep meaning discenible only to martialarts cinema philosophers and theres no suchandsuchesque substance that gives this film any secret subtle brilliance  this is simply tarantinos monument to his own dark obsessions and not much more,cruel
with so many people rating this movie so highly i decided i needed to see it boy was i disappointed this movie is nothing but a big budget samarai movie oh wait to make it interesting they leave out many details of the plot and the movie ends with to be continuedimagine if you hadnt read lord of the rings and when you saw the fellowship of the ring they didnt let you know what frodos quest was all they showed was fighting and the movie ended with frodo continuing his journeythe only story line is why did they almost kill her in the first place i for one am not going to be around to find out,cruel
i really like tarantino but even qt cant thrill me with a story which is too simple too boring and which has no climax at all dont tell me that i have to see vol 2if you want to see fighting special effects go and see matrix if you want to see martial arts see bruce lee you can fill the list with italo western dirty harry etcsure qt always took the style out of other movies which is ok but this time he didnt put it together how he did it in pulp fiction in my opinion this is because of the weak storyat least the direction and the acting is good so its not a bad movie only a boring movie,cruel
ive just been to see please excuse me if i find it a bit difficult to get my thoughts together cos im still taking my jaw off the floor first thing is ive been a fan of tarantino since i saw reservoir dogs ten years ago im not a teenage fanboy who thinks qt is god im a cynical old geezer who has seen a few movies in my time if sucked i would be the first to shout it from the rooftops but it doesnt suck its easily the most entertaining action movie ive seen since well i cant even think of anything to compare it to and yes this is an action movie so if youre expecting depth to the characters and any kind of insight into the human condition youre out of luck tarantino showed in jackie brown that he can do that this time round hes come up with a purely visual visceral popcorn movie i usually despise most modern examples of that all those cynically packaged and carefully marketed cgiinfested blockbusters the main reason i enjoyed so much is that it was blatantly obvious that tarantino has made this movie to please nobody but himself thats why it really works for me he doesnt give a damn whether you like it or not hes just making a movie he thinks is super cool thankfully i agree with him its jampacked with popculture references and echoes of movies past and present  obvious ones obscure ones from 70s chop socky classics through to the outrageous genrebusting of takashi miike dead or alive ichi the killer city of lost soulsetc via spaghetti westerns and peckinpahs the killer elite the soundtrack is mindbogglingly eclectic and ranges from nancy sinatra to morricone to isaac hayes to krautrock legends neu to 60s onehitwonders the human beinz plus some rockin live numbers from japanese girl band the 5678s theres bruce lee injokes and nods to battle royale one of the stars of the latter chiaki kuriyama is featured in the most exciting fight scene here and a cameo from sonny chiba and even  get this  a homage to the hilarious martial arts cult classic the one armed boxer vs the flying guillotine but look you dont have to get all the references and recognize tarantinos sources of inspiration to enjoy the more you know the more youll get out of it but even a novice will find plenty to entertain them to say i eagerly await volume 2 of is the understatement of the decade,cruel
really the title says it all i was especially surprised by the poor pacing the vast majority of the film is spent explaining backstory but the backstory isnt that interesting the bride as a metacharacter is inherently empty as is most everything else in this film easily half the scenes could have been cut even the fight sequences which make up about 10 of the film seemed pointless some people i know who really liked this movie seem to have bought into its mythology clearly the film has its own world its just not a very surprising or interesting one there are some good jokes here and there the line of aviator sunglasses across the police officers dashboard comes to mind but a few decent gags does not a good film make i read in an interview with tarantino that vol 2 is going to be slower than the first installment slower than this is that even possible looks like is treading into tarkovsky territory except you know without any of that russian existentialist poetic grace,cruel
of course i was also curious by the new movie of tarentino after his moviespulp fiction that was innovating from dusk till dawn that was great by visual effects and surprising jacky brown that was sober but good my tensions were high unfortunately i must say i was disappointed first there was a thin or rather no story it was obviously made for the visual effects no problem i also like movies with great visuals but also on this point i think it wasnt very good in the beginning you think thats great thats funny but after seeing the same tricks again and again it started to be silly normally a strong point of tarentino are the conversations but in this movie they miss the sharpness and strength another thing disturbing for me was the music it started also beautifully with the opening song but after that it became worse and worse with the climax the pan flute muzak that was not funny strange thing was that the rza had a big hand in it because you could have expected some quality from his hand after forexample ghost dog the way of the samoerai funny i have to think about thismovie of jim jarmush because it also handles about  fighting art but this movie that is much more sober has a story a point and an atmosphere that isauthentic that is i think the problem with this new movie of tarentino it misses the sharpness and strong authenticity im used when i look at his movies this movie is entertainment nothing more and maybe less im afraid i will forget this movie soon but i hope and will be sure that he will make new movies what will contain the sharpness i like,cruel
volume 1 combines some the best action and classic tarantino dialogue  while the dialogue does not match up to any of tarantinos previous movies what it lacks for dialogue it makes up for with actionhowever is not blessed with the great acting of all of tarantinos previous movies  some of the lines are delivered kind of ackwardly including uma thurmanalso is a very very very violent movie  it is rare that you will find 5 minutes straight without blood and the amount of blood is at times comically exaggeratedalthough this is not quentin tarantinos best is unquestionably a movie that cannot be missed,cruel
this had the most gore and violence ive seen since watching saving private ryan  the big difference is that spielberg showed graphic violence of the us soldiers storming the beach at normandy because he wanted you to feel what is like for our men on dday  spielberg is about 100 times better at directing that quentin tarrantino,cruel
this seems to be the work of a film maker who has run out of things to say my companion and i both felt that this was perhaps the emptiest film we had ever seen we find the hype around this film bemusing be prepared to be disappointed  the emperor has no clothesunlike his previous productions the script is devoid of plot suspense wit character development or any of the qualities that make storytelling on film worthwhile instead we have a series of mindless violent set pieces and knowing fan references to asian genre movies it is not the violence that turned us off  it is too stylised to be objectionable  but the utter lack of any point to the thing even the fight scenes themselves were predictable and repetitive with none of the flair of the great kungfu directorsthe bard summed it up rather well a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing,cruel
three fight sequences a couple of gags no story no suspense and plenty of references for those seeking that little thrill of selfsatisfaction but otherwiseoh sod it i was bored stiff im just hacked off i fell for the big marketing campaign and actually paid money to go and see it dull dull dull dull dull more does not necessarily mean better see also matrix ii and the next one im not 14 any more and i want to see a good story will i bother to go and see the second part no chance,cruel
spoilers herein  this is my very first commentary on imdbcom over a motion picture  and frankly ive never seen so much heated controversy over whether or not this film actually deserves full merit or none at all and me i know i cant quite match wits or opinions with some of the others who have posted here being a high school senior myself but i shall try in 1000 words or lessfirst off something that must be made abundantly clear  this film is not for everyone  if you hate buckets of blood obviously real or fake this film is not for you  the same for those who dont approve of heavy collections of different cinematic angles and gimmicks or slightly cheesy and campedup dialogue  however for those of us who look past this and have the ability to see the true art behind a films campiness the boondock saints superman ii ed wood then i highly recommend this filma few controversial subjects on the film i feel the need to justify1 the violence  as much as we hate to admit it some of the best filmmakers of this year have proven themselves artistic through the gore they deliver onscreen  and frankly no one has been able to pull it off better this year than tarantino has  unlike his previous films which deliver blood hard fast and real this film rather delivers it with good taste  where there is an abundance of blood as there usually is in this slash n dash japanese films he overstates it with extremely fake showers of blood  and where there is but a little blood it is performed in good taste with a true artistic liscense  personally i have yet to see blood strewn out more beautifully in a motion picture than a  gogo yubari crying tears of her own blood and  b  oren ishiis foot padding having blood trickle between her toes and on the side as well  in my opinion tarantino has overused the blood in this film simply because there was no better way to deliver it as well as to make it so abundant so we really had no choice but to get use to just how much there was2 the cinematography  yes a lot of tricks and gimmicks were pulled in this film treating us to much eye candy  and yet while it may appear as a mere distraction to some for others it is a feast for our optical senses and yes it is possible to look at all the different angles and camera tricks and say that it was simply thrown together  but for me what i saw was tarantino making each segment of the movie its own as each if section was a short story yes a chapter of a much grander story  personally i found the anime to be very authentic and full of class for what it was the switch to black and white then back to color then the blue lightingnot distractions mind you but accentuations to scenes beautiful as they already are3 the settingmusic  two in one  i have personally been to tokyo and okinawa and can personally claim that this movie held very true to its roots in these locations  there are tea bar just like the house of blue leaves  the acting from the japanese thespians was very true to form and save the fact that it rarely ever snows in tokyoother than that i could see very little that would say to someone who knows slightly about true modern culture in japan this just doesnt fit  as for the music very well done  again i can see how someone would consider this to be the most pathetic cheesedup thrown in plate of garbage in the world  in response all i can do is point out the ceremony of the sword  authentic japanese woodwinds with mariachi horns  sorryyou just cant beat that4 the dialogueplot  campy  indeed  simplistic  yes at first sight i mean what could be more blunt and elementary than uma thurman will  butit takes an eye to look past the first dimension of quentins usually flawless and realistic dialogue to see that this like fiction dogs and brown it is an art filmbut under a different genre  tarantino is much like one of my favorite actors mr johnny depp  everything said and acted is melodramatic overreactive overstated and extremely drawn out however unlike the many flops of this year the difference is how these two men perform the task of overacting on purpose  tarantino purposely overdid the entire script simply to add not only to the tribute of previous classic marital arts flicks of oriental descent but also to prove that he can take a plotline with dialogue which would have bombed with gigli proportions under another directorwriterand make it work alsodid anyone else notice a slight feeling of de ja vu when uma thurman quickly drew out a square with her finger in the beginning ala pulp fiction  mehmaybe its just meto me i consider this film an epic  not a lawrence of arabia epic to the very least  but in its own right under this day and age it is considered well done and will be remembered  if for nothing else for reminding us of a time when plot and dialogue was allowed to be cheesy as hell and it worked  and forget what everyone else said  personally for having to cut the movie into two volumes i like the ending  sure beats what we had to put up with for reloadedwhat if i told youher daughter was still alivecaseys review  97  a,cruel
its interesting that vol 1 and scary movie came out very close to eachother both films are such that if you havent seen the films that they honour or mock then you simply wouldnt understand what the film is trying to do i recently saw for the 3rd time with a friend and she came out of the film saying i thought the story was very shallowi thought that it was just relentless killing after killing after killing i realized that everything that i thought was cool about the film she simply didnt notice or understand if you saw scary movie without every seeing or hearing about the matrix or scream you would think that the film is a plotless and stupid film its the same thing for if you havent seen any of the japanese or western films that this film feeds off of for examplewhen the green hornet theme is playing through the filmi was so delighted and excited to hear that song againand i found it funny and interestingbut many people didnt get it the split screen depalma stuff was awesome to meonly because it reminded me off why tarantino did it that way lots of people just didnt get itsopleaseif you think that it is a bad moviedont spread that aroundbecause you just dont know any betterbt,cruel
is an over the top relentless kick in the a what tarantino pulled off is a homage to some of the greatest action directors  most knuckle heads who favor the kind of crap out in todays theaters will not understand the references to such classics as yojimbo and once upon a time in the west  tarantino made a masterpiece for true movie buffs this movie is meant to be a fun throw back to grind house exploitation cinema and not some bloated selfimportant psuedophilosopical nonsense watching this movie gave me a sense of what movies are really all about fun and escapism if i wanted reality id  have turned on the eleven oclock news,cruel
shallow this is my first impression after seeing quentin tarantinos new movie it is shallow because the plot is weak even though tarantino uses his now habituals time ellipses a good realisation doesnt necessary compensate with a weak scenario and mr tarantino should know it as he usually makes movie witch are excellent in both  plot and realisation well is an exceptionviolent words and images are utterly violent in my opinion this one goes too far how can anyone laugh about pedophilia or a child seeing her mother being killed or even rape  you need to be very talented and very sensitive to use these subjects in a movie and make people more aware of them instead of using them to create a morbidgrotesque atmosphere people were laughing during the movie but i think that it was because they were feelig uneasy and nervousno surprise usually tarantinos movies are surprising but is not it uses and abuses of ideas seen before in other movies here is an example  why these crouchingtigermatrixstyle fights  it seems that nowadays every action movies realisator wants to use the same effects but after seeing them in countless movies they loose their magic and originality if you want good fights watch the originals crouching matrix hero or old school kungfu moviesboring there is no mastery of time in this movie i think that it could easily be 30 minutes shorter for example the last fight is far too long and seems to be a weak excuse to split the movie into two parts what about the lord of the rings  what about magnolia  what about other very good movies which are as long as part 1 and 2 put together  the reason is  pure marketing and a pathetic effort to be original which fails,cruel
the fighting scene is good editing is good but i hate when there is blood spreading around like water fountain  i had been distract what kind of movie is this is this a comedy action drama or cartoon story is weak too how a person who had been in coma for years suddenly become great in the martial art,cruel
viewers who demand more of a movie than endless fightingscenes will leave the theatre regretting they wasted their time onthis one tarantino who is fascinated by the asian moviemakingscene has gone too far in his remaking of various mindlessmovies and has lost one important ingredient a script thoroughlyreplaced by seemingly never ending violence anyone who findsrepetitive fighting entertaining will have everything catered for himin this flickthe few times the script makes something of an appearance it isto further embellish the idea of mystery instead of having to gothrough all the work of actually making a mysterious movie theresult is of course that the whole movie falls flat without leavinganything but regret that one wasted so much time watching thisparticular movie,cruel
i waited for this film for a very long time and the final product went above my highest expectations this film is a masterpiece in every sense of that word its unique and people who say its a crouching tiger hidden dragon ripoff are totally wrong this film still has the tarantino feel to it and its done by music as well as the dialogues humour and the time shifting storyline however even though holds this tarantino trademark its a film totally different from the likes of pulp fiction or reservoir dogs tarantino once again picked uma thurman a move which proved to be so decisive her presence is felt by the audience and i think she is just brilliant wouldnt be as good without her she must surely get an oscar for that performancethe fighting sequence is unbelievable the agent fight in matrix reloaded looks silly when compared to this especially that one uses hardly any cgis when i left the cinema after seeing it my friend said to me that the film would be better if the main character was male i think the fact that its a female contributed to the film and made it more unique besides i dont think that there is anyone that could replace uma thurman she was born for that role some people might not like it because its too violent but the this violence is intentionally presented in a comical way masterpiece 1010,cruel
quentin tarantino is a genius sick and twisted genius but a genius nonethelesscollect the best scenes from classical martial arts movies and other great stuff such as samurai fiction yojimbo seven samurai green hornet enter the dragon star trek matrix matrix reloaded lone wolf and the cub battle royale take an actor from battle royale to play a cute schoolgirl and countless others add some modern twist and use the modern possibilities to make them up to date  and how they should have been done give them all respect they deserve then read a pile of comics  manga marvels japan stuff  and borrow the graphic style from them and parodize everything in an intelligent waymake a story that is a mother of all vengeance stories dont take it too seriously  make it a parody as wellthen get a bunch of lads together make them to talk about the movies that they loved when they were 15  get them back to that moment use their ideas of how you could put their favourite fighting scenes in to your movie  and then ask them how would they want to spice them up use every single ideaadd quentin tarantino to the soup as a main ingredientlove every minute of itshort description intelligent parody of martial arts movies best movie that tarantino has ever made do not skip this,cruel
having seen a number of quentin tarantinos films and havingbeen caught up in the hype surrounding the release of this film imay have walked into the cinema with higher expectations than ishould have although i was intrigued by the changes in film style switchingfrom monochromatic to anime to being saturated with color iwas left with the distinct impression that this level ofexperimentation with different techniques was closer to thatexpected of a new film student who hasnt yet learnt to stick to atriedandtrue formula i hate to have to say it but i think that any martial art film fan givena few weeks worth of film training a multimillion dollar budget acast of veteran actors and a few thousand litres of fake blood couldhave done the same if not better a job if you are looking for an interesting way to spend a couple of hoursthen this film is for you if youre looking for something asstimulating as reservior dogs or pulp fiction then your moneyis probably better spent buying on of those two films on dvd,cruel
spoilers    spoilers let me just start off by saying that i had never seen a qt movie before in my life and that in reality i went to the theater with my husband to see scary movie 3 but alas it was sold out and my husbands friend suggested im not a big fan of uma thurman so i wasnt happy about the idea and went into the theater with the attitude of a three year old who didnt want to take a nap but as the movie started and well after daryl hannahs annoying whistle music i found myself actually caring about the character which for all dramafilmtheater students is the ultimate of a great storytheres certainly a lot of passion to the film and thats i think what gives it depth hearing at the end about how her child was still a live totally threw me through a loop even though i know now thats probably the only right way to end the filmmakes a great bridge to the sequelthe acting was at more than its best and lucy liu and vivica a fox totally blew me away with their performances the only draw back to the film was the way you felt after watching it like you didnt get enough of the storyim impressed though way to go uma and qt im looking forward to the sequel,cruel
omg i was incredibly bored watching this two hour cutemup film which is the long awaited fourth film for the beloved popdirector quentin tarantino i did get blown away by pulp fiction and equally impressed by reservoir dogs and jackie brown but where as his previous films build a lot on excellent characters and their makeshift relationships for instance i found nothing of that in vol1 what is this film about apart from a unlikely samurai blonde and her misunderstood misguided search for revenge this film tell nothing of who these people are or what they do for this mysterious bill no plot what so ever there is a scene where uma thurman kills some 50 sworded men which probably goes on for 40 minutes where i desperately hoped for that bloody scene to end  just because it was so extremely tedious i felt nothing for any of the characters in the film a two hour show off from qt who seems to have run out of stories to tell it is so disappointing since jackie brown seemed to be such a mature film in qts collection and hoping he would evolve more towards this direction off course we must take into consideration that hyped films bring strong criticism but that does not forgive that vol1 has no story or plot if you fancy watching some bizarre cutemupgoresamurai film why not watching the real japanese thing or something neither does tarantino bring us something new nor give us a story or characterization worth watching the only thing that can forgive qt is if vol2 is so ingenious that it brings the two films together is some new revolutionary body of film lets hope sops i love battle royal,cruel
words cant give justice to this work of artthis film must be seen to be understood qt hits what he was aiming for the acting is spot on the blend of music photography dialogue and action fit together perfectlyso simple so pure so beautifuldo yourself a favour and experience you wont regret it,cruel
this is a very stylish film  a very imaginative film full of creative touches and thoughtful references tarantino draws fine performances from his actors he also makes the extreme violence of the fight scenes appear stylish  sexy even it will appeal to young audiences everywhere which is why tarantino makes me sick,cruel
this movie is unlike any tarantino film ever by far his best work i mean i loved pulp fiction and the others so dont get me wrong but this movie is just so theres not even words to describe it personally i take my hat off to him,cruel
while the plot might be tolerable the rest of the movie is totally boring this film is poor in every detail except blood and guts  this modern day terminator should team up with rambo to rid the world of evil  the fountains of blood were extremely over done to the point of boredom however the movie left you wanting to know what happens in part two  i doubt that i will do anything but rent part two to relieve my curiosity it obviously is rated 1 at the box office because there is nothing else worth seeing,cruel
do you have to be a film student to enjoy this movie  i will be the first to admit that the movie shows exceptional directorial skills  however the film lacks one thing that i consider crucial for a great movieplot  let me get this straight  uma thurmans character was shot on her wedding day by bill and presumed dead  however she survives and goes on a mission to kill those that were involved in her attempted assassination  now to methis sounds like the plot for a baction flick  i understand that hes paying homage or whatnot but does that make it a great movie  when i first walked out of the film i thought it was a spoof another element i found extremely lacking that was prevalent in tarantinos previous films was dialogue  pulp fiction is one of the most quotable movies ive ever seen which makes it incredibly cool  the dialogue in is cheesy and overdone paying homage to old samurai movies again   there was very little done to make me identify with the main character and there was absolutely no way i could contain my laughter when the volcano of blood shot out of the recently decapitated body   i am not posting this to offend anyone that enjoyed this movie  i seriously want to know what it was that i missed that makes this movie so awesome,cruel
by no means did i dislike this movie but the fervor and claims that this is the best or most entertaining movie of 2003 are retarded  have you not seen any other films this year  its not even a complete film two towers and empire at least have complete dramatic arcs that feel solid even though they clearly require films on either end to be complete  vol 1 feels more like reloaded half of a movie rather than a chapter in a saga  for people who are fans of shaw brothers chambara and sergio leone i can sympathize with the excitement of an amalgam and update to these classics by perhaps the most zealous film appreciatorcreator of our day  for those that have never seen or dont care to see the roots of i especially cant see why they think this is so amazing  theres plenty of weak sht to compliment the good stuff  thats just honesty people who toss around you just dont get it need to hold their tongues because i certainly doafter i got over the shaw logo sonny chiba the nod to fukasaku via chiaki kuriyamas presence the track suit and gordon liu i took a serious look at this film and wonder wtf happened to qts writing  i dont need snappy dialogue or waxing on about the silver surfer but goddamn much of the dialogue is flat  and its not for lack of acting either  further why are some scenes so fatty and long  and by long i dont mean ticktocks i mean waste  the sushi conversation served no purpose till 90 of it was done it totally sucks the juice out of a scene and its not building like the slow burn of eastwoods unforgiven or the tension of scotts alien so wtf is happening  this is meant to be a riproaring ride of revenge and instead its got a limp  before the add cracks and mtv generation remarks come flying that doesnt mean i object to the drama in fact i think that is what makes the bloodshed engrossing  but it needs to be well done and in this film i feel that theres too much dead timethe action scenes are good and could we expect anything less  wo ping and chiba as the kenjitsu advisor are vets of the industry and robert richardson delivers some great looking film as one would expect from a man whos worked on tons of oliver stone pictures  it would be a travesty to not have them well done  though it is unfortunate that the grand sword battle had to be made bw some shots look classy while others are hard to appreciate due to the difficulty of seeing whats happening  that said this is not the best action ive ever seen  and it lacks a certain soul if you will  a great action scene gets my pulse up and my hands will actually shake  i think i kept a straight 5965 pulse through the entire house of blue leaves awesome name for a club  is it technically impressive sure but look at the talent involved and the money  i think the side effect of it is that the movie lacks hunger  anyone who has seen a movie called versus can attest that for 400000 the movie has great action and splatter fx even if they dont like the movie besides these technical merits has a total budget of 55 million  i didnt see action on the screen that had the same drive to innovate or be clever that versus or a dozen other similar projects have  tarantino and crew have basically lifted the well established action movements and scenarios from countless classics and put a lot of money into making them polished  this is all well and good but the end result is that there is no single moment in the martial fury that the bride unleashes that isnt a been there done that  which also isnt really a problem except that people talk about this movie like its the second coming and qt himself talked up the action as rivaling anything hes ever seen and i can only guess hes seen more than i have so what givesi gave this section of the epic a 710  its clearly well made in many respects but it hardly innovates or sets the bar higher in any category  be that an exercise in style gore action story or characters perhaps vol 2 will raise that overall score,cruel
i am at a complete loss for words to describe this film  no positive review could do this film justice  quentin tarantino is a genius  go see this film  i dont know how any of you out there that are bashing this film can call yourselves movie fans,cruel
i saw this movie 4 hours ago and i still cant form words  all i could say was ill be back tomorrow  since then ive said best movie ive seen since pulp fiction and every now and then the word epic comes to mind great a simple word but effective  not very great really great  this is a modern masterpiece this movie will outlive us all,cruel
 hm i prepared myself for the blood and all that it has been advertised with but technically i was totally bored  yes one can say that where blood is supposed to be the opposite of boring its a very primitive level  but come on its not me who wanted the blood its tarantino and the campaign  i wanted a movie with a story  thats what i always want  i only take it as with all the blood is not supposed to be boring in tarantinos world but it is  i was and it will probably be in february 2004 when we get 2 see the second half of itboring and very artzy you almost keep hearing tarantinos mind talking to himself about how much people will hate this or that scene  but he thinks its true and beautiful  i did dislike some of the sceens indeed on account of being very cheap the uma thurman character has super power so when she fights you can already start yawning let the weapon of choice be kitchen knife or the toptop cult kinda blade that of the samuraiz as used in showdown with the lucie liu character most boring so far from where i sand it appears so that tarantino needed to come back and he had 2 options for that 1 introducing a new tarantino with new a kinda vision with a new swift showing that he is a different mind already but the same sharp as before if not even sharper  ie making a pretty good thriller an ordinary movie that is just one of all movies which only shines better2 introducing a new tarantino that has more to tell  like going down to where hard core art movies grow  making a shockingly good art movie  that tells everybody so much it looks that he needed to come back badly since now everybody already learnt how to make a movie like he showed in 3 masterpieces true romance absolutely included now u turn the tv on and wherever u look ull find something that comes out of what he created and invented beforeits like defending the world championship  too bad that instead of taking the gloves and making a real smooth or cool or sharp or beautiful movie i mean a real movie he just created a joke ps for those who for all that really luv tarantino i suggest dont be stupid only go watch it when both halves are out  in february 2004 peter josvai cspvhu,cruel
did i expect a lot from tarantino with this film you bet  but to compare vol1 to pulp fiction or jackie brown or reservoir dogs come on people  this is a big film fan wad blow  hes only been saying that is what was gonna be for i dont even know how long  it was pure big budget pop culture grindhouse trash with that ultra stylized tarantino flare  if you hate grindhouse and kung fu of course your gonna hate but if you embrace it and accept it for what it is and go in expecting a popcorn movie woooohooooo you too will feel like a kid in a candy store,cruel
im a movie geeki watch fritz lang movies darren arronofsky movies indie films historical epics romantic dramas my favorite movie is somewhere between the remains of the day and scarface im that diverse and judgemental in my selection  this is my new favorite movie  it has the best soundtrack  the best action scene  the best acting  it blows any other movie out of the water be it the matrix star wars or the lord of the rings  it is that good  and before this night i couldnt think of my favorite movie just narrow it down to thee or 4  god bless our lord quentin tarrentino,cruel
what can be said mayhaps a better poet then i could speak of this movie to give it justice however i will say this much i havent seen such a beautiful movie since i dont know when this movie made me remember my passion for creation thank you quentin tarantino thank you you have given me my faith back,cruel
holds a very dear place in my heart id be lying if i didnt say that i liked nay loved nay memorized everything quentin tarantino hasever been affiliated with started with a spur renting of reservoir dogs to finding my parents copy of pulp fiction which i literally destroyed by watching so much and within a year i had everything hed ever starred indirectedor written under my belt im not exaggerating when i say memy dadand my brother have memorized every single line in pulp fictionat the same time i love japanese and hong kong cinema ive watched almost every big hk kung fu movie and quite a few of the small ones ive seen 14 zatoichi movies for christ sakeand of coursebattle royalenowenter about nine months ago i go on imdb and type in the qt man and find that hes directing a 4th film within an hour ive memorized the actors in it sonny effin chiba and seen the teaser a good 3 times i cant even begin to count how many times ive seen it now this is my film this film was all i could talk about for the past 6 months and today at school i told everyone eff house of the dead its about kill effin bill and everyone more or less hates me now cause of this stupid movie so how was itin one word scrumtulescentthe movie is a train ride from the very beginning the first thing we see is an awesome feature presentation logo the kind youd see in a 70s release of a wu tang flick from there we open up on the bloody and scarred face of uma thurman as the mysterious bill talks off screen an amazing tarantino soliloquy follows and then the credits nothing more than white text on black background while nancy sinatras haunting bang bang playsbased on this alone you can get an idea of what is like its dark its bloody its gory but it also has its little hilarious quirks this film is so quirky its insane its shot in the tarantino orderakaout of order but at no point does it seem like a gimmick at the same time tarantino has no qualms with completely ruining the flow weve all come to know in the average movie the best example i can give of this is when tarantino launches into about a 10 minute anime back story animated by our friends at production iggod bless yall of one of the characters literally out of the blue it does not seem out of place or anything at all in fact its a great breath of fresh airthe action is justgod i cant even begin to explain it i love old kung fu stuff but lately its too complicated the fights go on far too long and involve such ridiculous stunts that by the end i just dont care anymore this is old school all the way excluding 2 or 3 flips it is all grounded and its kept nice and sweet she doesnt play chicken with 50 guys for an hour she beheads dismembers and mutilates about 80 or so characters in about 7 minutes and its awesome the violence is so ridiculously out of control that you cant help but just laugh at it but also be amazed at its entertainment value it blows anything the matrix has even attempted out the water and this didnt need a bullet time gimmickand now we come to the ending something that everyone has been dreading since it was announced the film would be split does the ending work hell mothereffin yeah the ending leaves you with a closed chapter but a plot twist that leaves you in suspense but not the insane suspense of the matrix in the end im glad it was split as i doubt even i could appreciate a 4 hour nonstop gore revenge flickmy only complaint is that there isnt more i dont mean the sequel but i mean just more of the plot i mentioned the anime sequence above now i used to love anime i was knee deep in it but i havent seen an ounce of it in probably 2 or 3 months because its just all poppy cheery kiddy crap or the same recycled romanticshounen plot over and over well this is anime i love its gritty its violent its dark its just some of the best animation ive ever seen i just wish there was a fullon 24 episode series of it at the same time i know once the movie is over im gonna want more tarantino hack and slash fun i can only pray that this becomes tarantinos bond series where he makes a new installment every few yearsi gave this movie a 1010 but no matter how you cut it a 100 this is an amazing effin movie,cruel
i mean god damn your never gonna see another movie like this in the next year or so i cant even describe it in words i just am getting off the high of seeing one of the bestbloodiestactionpacked movies of all time it comes roaring out full forced tarantino at his best and abstract using all his influences its kind of like a stylish homage to his many influencesold kung fu movies hong kong action flicksanime and spaghetti westerns and the cool dialogue youve come expect from taratino hell they even have sonny chiba the characters are all interesting esp uma giving her best as the vengeful black momba ok maybe im just a little over excited but i do think this is one of the best movies ive ever seen and along with the killer the best action movies ive seen but thats just my opinion go see for yourself you probabally will not be disapointed cant wait for episode 2 to come out did i mention by the way that this movie is extremly bloody,cruel
it seems he has done it again  this movie is nothing more than a masterpiece  everything is almost perfect about this film  it is definitely one i could see over and over again  i do not like however having to wait almost 5 months to see the enduma was great and so was everyone else  they made their parts believable and the way it was filmed was also outstanding  i cant wait for the end this film is a must see for anyone who likes good cinemago see it now,cruel
i have been waiting for this movie to come out since i first heard of it around 2 years ago  it is hard to live up to anticipation like that but 1 was better than i ever could have hoped  there were so many subtle and not so subtle references to grade b action flicks even i may have missed a few  i clapped at the opening splash on the screen that said shawscope  what a wonderful tribute to hong kong cinema  every scene was complete within itself  the audience knew what to expect from seeing the thousands of films to which this one paid tribute  quentin delivered what the audience expected and what they wanted but he did it better an more stylishly than they could have hoped for  i was completely absorbed in this comic book came to life and it delivered over and over again  i loved each and every vanquished villain and would love to see a whole movie about each one and what came before  i cant wait for volume 2,cruel
what is there to say this is obviously an homage to all bmovies especially to the actor bruce lee  the yellow jumpsuit the cato outfits the philosophical dialogue  the humor was excellent but was not forcefed like every movie nowadays  the action sequences are well choreographed and are actually fresh and new for once instead of bullettime or just guns in general  compared to pulp fiction and reservoir dogs this is right up there in my opinion i respect everyones opinions except for those that come from crass critics they have probably been nosedeep in trash for so long that they forgot what a good movie is like this movie is not going to make you scratch your head its just great fun with humor if you can stomach spewing blood and the occasional decapitation i recommendcowboy bebopif you can watch anime this is very close to the style and characters of this isnt dragon ball z or pokemon anime though if you watch the first 5 episodes of cowboy bebop youll swear is a prelude to cowboy bebop you wont be sorry for going outside the box,cruel
if youve been alive and conscious in this country for the last few months you will have seen ads andor the trailer for andor articles in magazinesnewspapersthe internet andor interviews withappearances by mr tarantino ms thurman et al  mr tarantino was on jimmy kimmels show just last night impishly suggesting 12yearolds should pay to see good boy then sneak into his movie  so everybody who would see it anyway knows what its about and what mr ts trying to achieve  just as jd salinger recommended decades ago that a writer should write what in his heart he most wants to read mr t makes the movies he most wants to see  i think he thinks his fans will also like it or will come around eventually and to hell with the critics altogether  so did i like it  well this is the first movie ive seen in years that i was actually sorry to see end would i recommend it  well remember the ads what you saw there is what you get in the movie and then some and then some more if this movie becomes a huge hit i hope ms thurman will get the credit she deserves  i was never a huge fans of hers before another wan pallid languid blowawayinabreeze blonde ingenue type she struck me as being i figured the brilliant performance tarantino extracted from her in pulp fiction was the exception proving the rule  well pass me the seasoned salt so i can eat my crow because thurman blew me away in this  she now has the lifeexperience in her face that wasnt there before physically shes at her peak from all that martialarts training she invests every line reading and every facial expression with just the right degree of oomph  tarantino called her a goddess recently  in europe she would be benefiting from the reverence and great parts written for mature women over there  here  older actresses practically need their own production companies to get something other than the honey is everything okay parts  midthirties is older for yank actresses sorry to saydont want to slight the rest of the cast we just dont see much of them except for the priceless lucy liu who lets her iconic character exude a kind of sad resonance  viveca fox is just a shade too yo wussup at times but then thats how quentin wrote it reminding us how hes down with the brothas  amazingly there wasnt a single nigger in his scripter excuse me nword   fun to see the legendary sonny chiba in a semicomedic wiseelder role  the japanese thugs male and female are all appropriately over the top barely recognized darryl hannah behind her eyepatch which of course had a red cross on it when she was impersonating a nursetarantino still eschews a straight linear narrative style opening this story immediately after a mass murder just as reservoir dogs opened immediately after a botched bank robbery and then bouncing back and forth in time assisted by oldfashioned chapter headings  he immerses himself in his usual trashpop culture mostly japanese this time around and displays the casual technical craftiness of a master as his camera follows people up and down stairs into and out of rooms up to ceiling level or down on the floor plus the standard eyeblink editing sequences favored nowadays  and some of his imagery is just plain gorgeous like when the bloodsoaked tea room gives way to the hauntingly serene fakesnow nightscape  as always he finds the music he wants  nothing by shona knife unfortunatelya word about the violence okay yeah its violentwell what were we expecting  but not nearly as violentgory as it could have been theres an entire sequence done in animation and another one that eases into black and white at a crucial moment  he deliberately uses the oldfashioned squibs  imagine if kubrick had done a decapitation how scientifically accurate it wouldve been  he manages to make his violence both painful and stylized even weirdly playful at times  theres nothing here like the sick atmosphere that many people seemed to think was the end of civilization in the recent house of 1000 corpses which actually had less violencegore than   tarantino makes it clear this is a capitalbmovie with modern production values of coursea bwithballs but i hope people also notice what a strong moral sense he has  i think it was no accident he used the term medieval in pulp fiction  remember the sequence beginning with the orderly and the big redneck entering thurmans room with the dialogue gradually revealing whats been going on over the four years of her coma  we see evil and we see it get punished  he doesnt think he has to spell it out for ustheres already controversy over the decision to divide this flick into two parts released several months apart  personally i wouldve preferred one long movie with an intermission to preserve the sweeping scope and emotional buildup but i understand why these decisions get made  it wasnt that long ago that once upon a time in america got butchered by businessmen contemptuous of the attention span and receptivity of the american mtv generation  if this is what it takes so we can see all the movie that tarantino wanted us to see so be it  he knows a lot is riding on this flickhe even kids it with the introduction the 4th film of actually its fourandaquarter if you count his contribution to four rooms which wouldve been a lot better if hed directed the whole thing he knows hes like the new orson welles who never went to film school or worked his way up through the biz  he knows the burden of having adjectives made out of his name viz tarantinoesque or posttarentino hes heard all the personal crap  gossip about him  well he shrugged it all off and now tells us heres my movie go see it if you want to  i for one think you should even if you werent into his stuff before  for sheer joyous audacious exuberance in filmmaking theres no one like him today  and remember people if we dont support him he may have to go work aaarrrgh overseas  hes one of us dammit and i want him herewhy hasnt michael parks had more work over the years  bless tarantino for remembering people like him and robert forster jackie brown and as far as im concerned john travolta should be sending tarantino a christmas card every year preferably with a check in it,cruel
a lot of people have been waiting a long time for this film actually two films and it just isnt up to snuff just as the long awaited star wars prequel was long on stylegraphics and short on just about everything else this film can boast immense bloodletting excellent music and style but fails to actually be a good film only in a completely desensitized culture can the violence be the plot there is nothing new here that you havent seen before and having to ponyup the extra 8 to see the rest of the film only highlights the true exploitation going on here,cruel
tarantinos latest offering vol 1 comes up just short of good the same filmmaker that wowed audiences with movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs has only disappointed this fan with what seems to be the same kung fu style action you can find just about anywhere else these days but with the trademark gore that is tarantinos flare flash forwards and backwards to piece together what seems to be a pretty flimsy plot thus far are much less confusing than in pervious movies and therefore less entertaining it almost seems that instead of making a movie he thought was good and letting the fans decide if they like it he is instead playing to the masses tarantino uses violence in most of his movies to get you to pay attention to major advances in the plots in this movie the violence seems neverending an ongoing barrage of knife fights sword fights kung fu fights and even some decapitation it used to stand that if i wanted mindless action i could go to any runofthemill action movie in a theatre and sit and be bored with explosions gunfights and blood but if i wanted action and something to think about i could check out a tarantino film sadly this is no longer the case and i must again reiterate how disappointed i was with this film and if you are still in a deciding in your own mind if they decided to split this movie up to make more money by making you want to pay to see the ending or if they thought it was just good film making your question will be answered in the last line of the movie that closes on what is a soap opera worthy cliffhangerover all 510 tarantinos standards should be higher than this check it out only to see the decline of a great filmmakers career that started just a decade ago,cruel
warning this review includes speculative comments about the directors sanity that are intended to be humorous exaggerations this critic actually knows nothing about diagnosing any mental inbalancewhat can i say about vol i  that hasnt already been said by hellacious hallucinations of a bloodsoaked hobits dancing outside our windows late at night  for starters it took everything that we thought we knew about what a movie is which used to be something along the lines of a 2 hour visual narrative and slamdunked it into a small hoop that is hanging up on the door that separates insanity from hundreds of gallons of fake blood let me first get one thing out of the way to either entice or warn you off depending upon what tickles you fancy this movie is violent its easily quentins most violent work to date and considering the fact that his movies are generally as violent as it gets id say this movie hits close to being the most violent film of all time unfortunately in my infant hours of having seen that is really the only thing about the movie that i can be sure of so if youre waiting for me to tell you what the movie was like apart from the extreme violence youll have to settle for whatever descriptions can escape this speechless critics brain a decent jumping off point would be try to imagine crouching tiger hidden dragon meets army of darkness and you have a small picture of what this movie is like i for one have never seen anything like not in the movies not anywhere it doesnt even resemble a movie in any sense that were familiar with its more like a 2hour collection of footage depicting the revenge agenda of an unnamed uma thurman character who has gone through hell and will gladly go through more hell just to collect her vengeance that essentially sums up the plot in its absolute entirety uma thurman basically is on a mission for revenge and kills everything she sees thats really all that happens in the movie a great deal of the film is exposition and the back story is pounded so well into us that even we are itching for bill whoever he is to taste the wrathful vengeance of uma thurman whoever she is  all things considered there is really nothing for us to work with apart from our crash course in revenge seeking dazzling visual texture and halfhour fight scenes some might argue that this movie is nothing more than eyecandy giving us a long awaited taste of the interesting things that quentin does with the camera whether or not this is true nobody can deny thatif nothing elsetarantino is the most interesting director of our time as far as seeing how his movies will look on the screen his style is so independent of convention that if i had never heard of quentin tarantino i would be pretty sure after seeing that he has never seen a single movie in his life unfortunately we happen to know that he is an accomplished filmmaker which means that the only explanation for madness would have to lie within the apparent madness of its maestro and this movie is so bizarre that if i and i happen to be a huge tino fan saw quentin tarantino on the street i would avoid eye contact and try to walk in the other direction without calling attention to myself because hes not sane and anybody who thinks otherwise needs to sit down and watch and remind themselves that the art came from within the mind of the artistif youre upset because this review didnt help you much with deciding weather or not you want to go see this movie i apologize fully and offer the following question do you think you can handle it because if youre going to see this movie you have to be ready to take lots of things with a grain of salt if youre a film student or consider yourself a film buff this movie is absolutely mandatory i for one found myself desperately not wanting this movie to end was entertaining and without question the most interesting experience ive ever had at a movie theatre good luck,cruel
fight porn is what this movie is not a lot of dialogue not much plot not much character development but plenty of money shots the action is relentless so im sure a lot of people read guys will love this movie it is not a classic though reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were definitely better movies as they had unforgettable characters and terrific dialogue and great music too this one has lots of swordplay and spurting blood there are a few laughs along the way as well with some interesting use of music so it is a fair effort,cruel

this is another masterpiece from tarantino its one of his absolute best with a wonderful story and top notch performances all the characters are just wonderful and it has some wonderful ott violence plus uma thurman is simply amazing in this the opening is quite grim and disturbing and the fight scene involving uma and the crazy eighty eights is jaw dropping however i wish the main fight between black mambathurmanand oren ishiilucy liu was a bit longer it was still cool though i loved the animation and all of the black and white sequences and the scene where the bride 1st wakes up from her long coma is quite emotional plus all the characters are extremely likable the music in this is great and the fight scene between fox and uma was awesome as well plus i loved chiaki kuriyamas go gocharacter i would rank this as tarantinos 3rd best right behind 2 and pulp fiction and this is extremely well written and made as well plus you may find yourself rooting for umas character as i felt sympathy for her charactermichael bowens character buck was absolutely despicable he truly deserved to get his head bashed in and sometimes the violence is so ott its comical plus the fight choreography was really well done i felt that what happened to oren ishiis parents was really sad and i just loved the ways on how the bride got revenge plus this movie deserves its place on the top 250 in my opinion the dialog is really cool and the scenes involving uma and sonny chibahattori hanzo were just great plus the swords in this movie looked so awesome i loved how creative and unique it was and quentin tarantinos direction is flawless in my opinion plus the character development is excellent for the most part i have seen this movie multiple times now as it gets better each time i watch it and well this movie is popular with so many movie fans and critics alike it may not be for everyone plus the ending was just great this is another masterpiece from tarantino its one of his absolute best with a wonderful story and top notch performances and if you havent seen it what are you waiting for do so immediately you shouldnt regret itthe direction is incredible practically flawless for the most part quentin tarantino does an incredible job here with amazing camera work outstanding angles great use of colors and lots of other great and stylish shots as well plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pacethe acting is amazing uma thurman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she gives one of her best ever performances is very likable is all business kicks that ass did fantastic in her emotional scenes was really into her role and i just loved the way on how she got revenge she was amazing uma rules lucy liu is hot and had one wicked character she was wonderfully evil but at the same time you feel for her she can also kick that ass with the best of them i loved her daryl hannah is way hot and also had a wicked character i just wished she had more screen time because she was awesome vivica a fox is very good in her sceneshe is a good fighter and was menacing i liked her david carradine had some good dialog but we hardly ever see his face michael madsen is good i guessbut like carradine we never see him hardly chiaki kuriyama is awesome as go go she was hot and had a really cool character i loved her michael parksearl mcgrawmichael bowenbuckjulie dreyfussofiesonny chibahattori hanzoall do what they have to do very well rest of the cast do fineoverall if you havent seen it what are you waiting for do so immediately you shouldnt regret it  out of 5,cruel

i like violent films as long as the violence is justified revenge in films need to follow that same rule the revenge in braveheart is justified a man kills the man that murdered his wife an eye for an eye the revenge in jaws is justified william wallace and chief brody deserve our respect because they take revenge at an equal proportion to how they and their community were wronged the bride in this film does not and thats why its a poor film this film goes far beyond an eye for an eye it takes a nose dive off the sanity cliff and plummets toward a soulless sadistic endeavor made by a sadist to titillate other sadists it advances the notion that we are meant to admire a sadist for taking out several eyes for the loss of just one eye its most sadistic crime is where the film attempts to actually justify forcing an innocent child to witness her own mother being butchered the scene ends with the murderer cooing at the child as though the kid could care less what her mothers murderer thinks about anything part 2 ends with the avenging sociopath walking off into the sunset with her own daughter unscathed like she earned that ending yeah rightin case you didnt notice this movie is about revenge we know this because the main character played by uma thurman constantly whines about deserving it this is not a character to be admired this is a petulant child throwing one manically violent tantrum after the next if this film were a book it would be titled a sociopaths guide to revenge anyway while she was clearly wronged the loss of just one life does not justify going on an insane rampage and killing dozens of peoplelet us think of the classic crime film the godfather a film that handles violence and revenge with complete class the first scene introduces the code by which the mafia live by the scene shows a man demanding revenge for his daughter being assaulted she is still alive but her father wants the two men responsible to die the godfather gives the man justice but not to the extent that he wants this is logical revealing the mastery of wisdom a mafia crime boss needs to maintain his position in the bride deserves revenge but not to the extent that she wants to round out the weirdness uma thurman was apparently preferred by tarantino since her face reminded him of the famous horse trigger no reallythe technical aspects of this film is good you have to give credit to the crew that completed their work with technical mastery the work though is directed by quentin tarantino so the real credit for his skill lies in the artists he steals from go watch thriller a cruel picture 1973 which was released as they call her one eye in america which is the basis for the daryl hannah character the lady with the eye patch over one eye or watch lady snowblood to see where tarantino stole the snowy fight scene or the several sonny chiba films that have better fight choreography while youre at it ask bruce lee fans how they feel about his most famous costume worn by a person who cant fight whose lack of martial skill is hidden by fast cutting like cheap perfume hides stinkno wonder tarantino makes a film about a sociopath supposedly deserving respect for reaping much more than they sow he has made a very successful career out of it in an america that has teenagers committing mass murder in high schools and in a world where death cults fueled by sadistic revenge threaten to destroy us all movies like this should never be made,cruel
this movie is well directed well made and has a good script it is a typical post modernist movie with many subgenres blended into it but what makes it stand out is its political incorrectness and ultra violence we have the bride out to get revenge and she will use every dirty trick possible and in the mean time poop on pride and principle to get revenge no time and space for petty selfrighteousness here this is what makes the movie so interesting and speaking of subgenres there are elements of spaghetti western samurai anime giallo and chopsocky the plot is taken from lady snowblood and even the song shura no hana flower of carnage by meiko kaji is taken straight from it is heavily influenced by lady snowblood with scenes and characters strongly resembling lady snowblood take for example the climax and fight with oren ishii then the spaghetti western with the extreme closeups and the music used to build up tension like sergio leone did there was also some giallo elements with elle driver coming to the bride to assassinate her the extreme closeups the simple music and the perspective of the murdererchopsocky also plays an element here with the fight scenes and sound effects with hints to the shaw brothers with the intro hey chopsocky legend gordon liu also makes an appearance as johnny mo the anime should be pretty self explanatory since it is the animated part of the movie oh i like how he also take influences from dario argento and sergio leone two directors whom i am very fond of argentoesque scenes include the long scenes that has no cuts with extreme closeups of objects or eyes of the characters with the leoneesque scenes it is the scenes where the characters stare at each other anticipating a fight with their surrounding also being used to build up tension to suddenly break it with fury how tarantino copies the directors is pretty impressive there are not many directors who can do it with such grace as tarantino did so tarantino takes many elements from genres and directors he likes and make sort of a hybrid homage or you can also say he is ripping them off but he loves them and it can be seen too it is the same thing with what george lucas and steven spielberg did original no but entertaining and well made yesbut anyway the movie is excessive politically incorrect and ultraviolent so there will be people who will be provoked by the movie the movie is provocative art anyway with sense of humor and self irony tarantino is an outrighteous director but that is why people like me like him as last words i will say it is not original the story isnt new it copies a lot of movies but it is still a good movie 810,cruel
myths colors tarantino  amazing choreography uma thurman in a great role fascination memories about old westerns and a total show vol  has not a real definition and to write a review about it seems only a game without purpose because after its end credits the only result is a large ball of emotions and colors fight scenes with the clear status as memorable and the feeling to escape from an unique adventure and this is all sure it is not so complicated to analyze each piece of the film but only important remains its special flavor the fragments of scenes the landscapes the drops of humor the pulse of revenge and the memories about similar stories who are in this case parts from a delicate precise steel embroidery a strange masterpiece because it is brilliant resurrection of themes and the spirit of b movies being profound different,cruel

fans of quentin tarantinos unique brand of exploitationcinema worship were forced to wait six long years for his next movie after his underrated loveletter to blaxploitation jackie brown 1997 the result was intended to be a 3 hour roaring rampage of revenge but instead thanks to the unenlightened head honchos at miramax became volume 1 a 110minute halfmovie that forced cinemagoers to pay again to see the following instalment four months later despite this moneymaking scheme that im sure tarantino wanted no part of he still refers to as one movie volume 1 is still quite brillianttaking inspiration from the kungfu and spaghetti western genre movies tarantino no doubt indulged in during his time as a video store clerk although vol 1 focuses mainly on the former is at times a montage of shots scenes and music from other movies from the 1970s yet tarantino doesnt so much simply copy these films but play on our genre expectations while making it fun to test your own knowledge as a cinephile in the process the tale is one of revenge and a simple one at that tarantino has no qualms in staging as a oneby one tickingoff of the bastards who wrongs our heroine known simply as the bride uma thurman who even carries a list of her targets and boldly strikes out their names as they falla massacre at a wedding chapel instigated by bill david carradine and his deadly viper assassination squad sees everyone inside murdered apart from the bride who is shot in the head and put into a coma waking up four years later she quickly sets about gaining her revenge on bill and his four cronies  vernita green vivica a fox oren ishii lucy liu budd michael madsen and the one eyed elle driver daryl hannah travelling to okinawa in japan she approaches legendary samurai swordmaker hattori hanzo genre legend sonny chiba and talks him out of her retirement to forge her weapon of deathtold in chapter form scenes are either extremely talky or outlandishly actionpacked the quieter moments bristle with tarantinos now iconic dialogue while the extended climax taking place in a twofloor restaurant that is quickly turned into a blood bath displays the directors thenunseen eye for action as the bride takes on orens gang dubbed the crazy 88 and her meteor hammerwielding bodyguard gogo chiaki kuriyama she hacks and slices her way through them all in a moment that evokes the matrix revolutions of the same year only with real people and an eye for action cinema its all backed by another terrific tarantino soundtrack that is routinely pillaged by tv shows too lazy to find their own music the ending leaves you hanging without feeling ripped off and eager to see the final three names crossed off the list,cruel
films number four and five of quentin tarantinos vol 1 and vol 2 are his most racy and daring and easily my favourites its a revenge story at its greatest uma thurmans the bride her real names undisclosed for reasons unexplained has a list to kill those whove done her severe harm starting with the deadly viper assassination squad who she was a part of and finishing with their leader bill nothing will stand in the brides way not even a mothers love for her daughter or hordes of the yakuza blood is shed lots of it many lives are lost all for our entertainment the story is delivered with panache every character is phenomenal thurmans being the only we can and want to relate to vol 1 is also a homage to asian martial arts films its dark humour and outrageous gore takes the edge off what could be a serious film vol 2 on the other hand takes a different turn,cruel
quentin tarantinos actiondrama vol 1 is an edgeof yourseat movie about love revenge and retribution beatrix kiddo uma thurman plays the role of a bride who was wronged by her former friends and coworkers by being gunned down in the middle of her wedding in the middle of el paso texas beatrix known by her former team members as black mamba wakes up out of her 4 year coma realizes her child is gone and sets out on a bloody path of killing and revengethe movie begins with a confusing battle between two people that seemingly know each other all while being interrupted by vernita greens vivica a fox daughter the back story of the movie picks up after this scene to bring the audience up to speed this also reveals the ultimate prize intended at the end of this rampage bill david carradine but not much in the way of details as to what happened and why it happenedthis style of production is common throughout the film tarantino would show a scene or two ahead of time and the next chapter would be the back story on what led up that specific event tarantino made special efforts in his production to leave story lines and plots easy to decipher and easy to follow but leaving out specific details to leave the viewer in suspense and wonder this brings answers to many questions in the particular scene but would often raise more questionstarantino also ensured the lighting throughout the film was clean clear and even in the fight scenes the lighting was not dimmed or shaded to hide flaws in the fighting or bring mystery to scene but was ensure to be bright and vibrant with distinct colors to being the audiences attention to the action carried out in each scene in the final fight scene with oren ishii lucy liu the scene was dark but welllit at the same time the scene was an outdoor terrace in japan with a thick blanket of snow covering the ground the elements in this scene were minimalistic but it brought a clean feeling to the entire sequence the overhead lighting outside was distinctly low but also enough to bring light from the snow and accentuate the actors and their positions the high contrast removed distractions from the storylinethe storyline had its own uniqueness but the classic story of coming back from the almost dead to seek vengeance is a common theme this reminds me of the recently released movie the revenant starring leonardo dicaprio tarantino did not develop a completely new storyline or theme but his production and direction to this movie definitely made it distinct and very fun to watch,cruel
vol 1 is an american action movie from 12 years ago now action is usually not my favorite genre at all but there is so much more to it but let us start from the beginning the writer and director is quentin tarantino and at 110 minutes this one is much shorter than his more recent works however you could of course also see this one and the sequel as one movie and then it would be a 4hour watch i am truly surprised this film here did not score any academy award nominations especially in categories such as cinematography art direction or costume its topnotch in these areas and same goes for thurman as lead actress i am generally not even a big fan of her really but she was amazing in this one at least the globes and bafta did not overlook herthis movie actually starts with the ending of the film if we take a chronological look at it with the bride vs vernita we even see in her list that she had already killed oren at this point but that is not a problem at all this film is not about if she will succeed but how she will succeed we all know she wont be stopped on her path to revenge we probably already know as well that she will kill the other guys on her list in the sequel this was pretty interesting as the division in chapters made this a very cleanstructured film but the nonchronology messed things up again pretty smart move by tarantino i am usually more a fan of chronological films but here it works very nicely especially on rewatchesits obvious tarantino had a great time making this movie not only was he working with his muse uma thurman but he could also make this a tribute to all the films and genres he loves being a film nerd himself and there are some pretty gimmicky scenes occasionally such as orens last words and camera shot the one in which the bride sends the young fighter back to his mother or when she acts really dumb before disclosing her real intention with hanzo or the charlie brown joking there are really quite a few memorable characters in here its not just the bride its also oren sofie fatale gogo yubari and others this should also put an end to those criticisms saying tarantino is not good at writing female charactersthe heart and should of the film is probably the entire chapter against oren everything before is good too vernita the church scenes the hospital scenes but the asian part of this movie is the best and the snow fight sequence at the end is a thing of beauty tarantino also truly managed to go out on a high note with which he made people very curious about the 2nd movie i quite like that one too and i will certainly review it at some point even if probably enjoy the first vol 1 is a mesmerizing watch great characters excellent story and a blessing in terms of visuals highly recommended,cruel
is as you can clearly tell by the title is an action movie mostly focused around killing bill its clear with just one look at this film that its going to be a actionpacked bloody thrill ride and boy it sure is although somehow managing to pull off a 2 hour run time feels too short not too much happens and thats where it seems to suffer the most it is a twopart series so that did leave hope for more development still it felt like the productiveness of the movie was lacking and although we certainly got to witness some amazing fights that was really about it the fights themselves however are great their bloody fast and very cool to watch fun fact the movie actually received an x rating above r for violence and one of the final scenes had to be toned down tarantino did this simply by taking away the color and making the whole scene in black and white color or not this was still a great scene the action is all so overthetop that its actually funny yet still so cool to watch overall volume 1 is very entertaining and a whole lot of fun it lacks in story and development but if you like violent movies as much as i do then this is certainly one you need to see its easily one of the best action movies out there,cruel
i absolutely love tarantinos movies so i like his style and this movie is so full of tarantinoisms you cant even count them this movie manages to not take itself seriously and be totally ridiculous in one scene and then get incredibly deep and serious in the next one of my favourite scenes is the sudden animepart which is absolutely beautifully done it is incredibly fun to watch and one is still intrigued by the story which is brought to the screen with a great cast for me this is the perfect movienight with friends movie because its also great fun to watch all in all a must see movie especially for any taranino fan,cruel
in vol 1 tarantino uses amazing artistic technique and cinematic skill to create some of the most poetic moments in film however is shockingly violent unlike tarantinos pulp fiction violence does not always contribute to the movies greatness at times the movies carnage adds to the art increasing the visual and emotional power of the movie at other times the viewer must wonder about tarantinos intentions as the director pours bucketfuls of blood on shiny floors floats in and out of the realm of greatness the opening scene is a symphony from beethoven yet occasionally tarantino gets caught up in the carnage and the movie temporary loses everything else that tarantino can masterfully juxtapose this violence with his artistic ability is only halfway redeeming the dialogue usually good sometimes stunning sometimes passable reflects tentative grasp on greatness is overall a great movie that fell short of greatness yet definitely worth the watch,cruel
i have always admired tarantinos films i love his style of mixing engaging dialogue and melodramatic violence in producing interesting films but for some reason has always been bottom of my list to watch but i eventually got around to watching it and i was not disappointedtarantino does not wait to get this film started with a very dramatic opening sequence it opens with a fight scene followed by a conversation that slowly reveals the plot to the viewer but keeping many things hidden like the protagonists name the film ends with a great fight scene with uma thurman taking down hundreds of japanese fighters with her samurai sword and eventually getting her revenge on lucy liu another thing i have always loved about tarantino is his use of strong women to play the lead roles in his film it is not done enough by the big hollywood films and its refreshing to see films that reject the clich characters of the popular moviesthe thing i loved about this film the most was the anime scene midway through the movie it was done really well with a great art style and managed to capture the violence that tarantino captures with live action it was a great addition to the film and shows tarantinos love for all different types of filmoverall i thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to the second instalment,cruel
summarythis review contains spoilersvolume 1s plot can be summated simply as an assassin uma thurman who wanted to taste a life of normality but unfortunately for uma she never quite developed the means to taste it the desire was there and all the pieces fell nearly into the right place but she just wasnt cut out for it in a rash attempt for normalcy uma breaks free from the team of assassins and sets out for marriage instead bill who raised uma from relatively innocent to worldclass assassin doesnt quite approve of the marriage bill orders the remaining of the assassins to murder her and anyone else during umas wedding ceremony bill takes special attention to finish the bride himself and somehow fails in the process after firing a bullet straight into umas skull ultimately leaving her in a comatose state for six months upon regaining consciousness uma sets out for revenge to murder the remaining assassins and ultimately bill theme from a young age uma was trained to be a human killing machine she was trained by bill day in and day out teaching her everything he knew uma looked up to bill and saw him as a father figure of sorts which is something she lacked before meeting bill from the day bill met uma or simply and often referred to as the bride bill has always thought of her as a natural born killer while the bride was trained to be the absolute and best killer on the face of the planet at least with a sword she no less has a conscience that struggles with who she is she whole heartily rejects the notion of being a natural born killer something bill seemingly repeats to the bride she makes a heartfelt attempt to bail on the assassin lifestyle to seek a life or normality but even then the bride struggles with what and who she is a killer or a woman a bridemotif and texture its said that a sword represents the soul of the person who carries it throughout the film a sword a japanese katana is displayed almost as a trademark for the film the sword carries symbolic significance in the film as it represents the brides dualistic nature as two sides of the blade one side of the blade is dulled while the other is sharp carrying its trademark sine wave pattern engraved down the sharp edge of the blade the sharp end of the blade represents the brides mind sharp and keen but dangerous and quick to kill the duller side represents the smooth consistency of the life she wishes to obtain through marriage the sword being a blade represents the dualistic nature of the bride and also her internal struggle of who she is a killer or a bride,cruel
i love revenge pictures and i have said before that i should probably see a psychiatrist for that this is probably one of the best revenge picture madethe bride uma thurman is out to kill those who destroyed her friends and family and put her in a coma causing her to lose her childher first mission to to travel to tokyo to see the infamous japanese crime lord oren ishii lucy lui that sword she gets from hattori hanzo sonny chiba better be good several gallons of blood were spilled in the effortthe journey has just begun,cruel
this is the first movie i have given one star on imdb im sorry  im sure its my fault for not liking this movie i must be missing something but in my poor limited mind this movie seems gratuitously hateful meanspirited inhumane and glorifying evil deeds i have seen the first two parts because friends of mine dragged me to see them and i have to say that this is just the kind of film that made me not so anxious to go to the movie theatre anymore this is the kind of genre that not only sickens me and shows me everything that is wrong with the world but also makes me worry that it will inspire sick minds to emulate the same kind of wantonness this movie revels in in fact i suspect it already has i fear that some weak and disturbed minds might not get the joke in the films if they have one those that like them seem to think theyre funny on some level or satires but i dont see anything funny about gruesome scenes and depraved murders  and these people might go out and repeat what theyve seen in them its funny  if you recall the furor warren beattys bonnie and clyde inspired for supposedly encouraging and celebrating violence  its strange that the films didnt also draw the ire of the critics quentin tarantino knows how to make a film thats for sure  but not the kind of films that i feel should be allowed to be shown its films like the films that makes me think the movie industry should exercise more taste and control over what gets released  are there no standards anymore with movies like these why wonder why there is so much violence today but that makes me seem oldfashioned and an advocate of censorship  not a popular idea in this culture where we worry about the growing violence in our society yet dont ever open our eyes to the likely causes,cruel
action and tarantino are essentially synonymous you can be certain that vol 1 has a lot of fighting and adventure in nearly every scene even when you least expect it waking up out of a coma for years is an immense task for anyone waking up out of a coma for years and then going on a rampage to seek revenge is superhuman we follow the journey of an illfated woman in known as the bride who lost everything on her wedding day including her husband her unborn child and herself almost killing people is not easy killing assassinswell let tarantino explain that although i love tarantino and his unique style there were definitely moments where the filming was just not up to par with the rest of his works the bride is definitely an interesting character with a rich and mysterious past that we as viewers are constantly trying to puzzle together the enigmatic theme surrounding this film definitely adds to its suspense as well with all this taken into consideration i would have to say that tarantino made a fine action film overall is a solid movie if youre looking for a fun film and want to fill the next two hours of your life with intense yet comical fighting this is the movie for you,cruel
this was the film that got me on the trail that ive been on for a few years now and thats understanding how tarantino comes up with such clever dialogue and crafting villains that we both despise and cheer for i found myself sympathizing with oren her story was a sad one even more tragic that she was dragged into the whole fiasco with the bride if it wasnt for that oren ishii would still be ruling over the crazy 88s then again that would totally change the story and interrupt the purpose of the film considering there are two films i felt this one set the stage perfectly for the second in this film we really get to know the bride and discover the atrocities committed against her as an audience we discover why she is on such a bloodthirsty rampage you will find yourself at the edge of your seat cheering for the woman in the bright yellow track suit her exceptional skills with the blade are left unexplainedwhich should make you more curious do they reveal that in the second what is her past with bill back to vol 1 watch as the warrior within grows and the attitude goes cold towards killing the bride is out for blood and shell be damned if anyone gets in the way of her revenge,cruel
this movie is something of an event a precious masterpiece a revenge driven tale compared to number 2 you wonder why this ones so violent but lovers of gore will lap it up here as theres plenty quentin has sprung back from his jackie brown failure leaps and bounds which apparently got him depressed and for many reasons i can see why in this dynamite violent movie extravaganza violence in abundance he should have a lot to be happy about again its first rate story telling as our surviving heroine thurman exacts revenge on her bunch of operatives led by her husband bill carradine who unfortunately youll only see in volume 2 responsible for shooting her down and killing her baby we have elongated scenes essential to the story that qt knows how to make interesting including that insignificant cu shot on a cup of coffee the characters of this elite squad are larger than life better than the super heroes you worship like carradine michael madsen almost ceases to exist here seen briefly in two three shots bringing one memorable and inspirational line to this explosively exciting flick a cinema must see the sword fighting is great and going on beatrices thurmans quest of vengeance as if riding alongside is an experience itself i love revenge tales but this unhurried one is so well told where were never see another genius story teller like this at least for the next hundred years oh did i forget to mention the qt humour yes its back in check this movie is such an impressively colorfully violent tale which makes nights at the movies what they really should be the great parks playing his from dusk till dawn character makes an appearance while in voulme two he plays a mexican brothel owner really showing us what characters acting about the musics great in this with qt borrowing an old classic in its opening after thurmans execution where an old proverb precedes this the final fight scene in the chinese snow garden is just typical of tarantino and his classic wit in a film void of any dull moment,cruel
to me this movie didnt need 2 versions and granted the 2nd movie was better but liked both equally and really thought there should only been 1 movie my favorite scenes were when the bride was remembering what put her in the hospital as she was in that truck trying wiggle her big toe and she says now lets get all these other piggies wiggling plus when she was talking about the head of the oran the fight scene at the end was not the greatest ever but this was an ok film i know this not the best of reviews but cant say much about that was basically made to ways when it should have just been made one way plus it is hard to review this film when i confuse it with kbv2,cruel
i was a little young when this movie came out and had not seen any other tarantino movies so you can imagine i was a bit shocked by it at the time the gore and violence was a bit extreme not unheard of just not as common as it is in films today and it took awhile to get used to i had to watch it several times to come to love it the way i do now tarantino is a genius and one of my all time favorite filmmakers on earth his mind is simply genius is about an ex assassin who had a formal love relationship with her leader bill that resulted in a pregnancy to protect the baby the black mamba fled the team and was about to get married to a safe guy when bill shows up on the night of the rehearsal dinner with the team and they kill everyone black mamba narrowly avoids death and is put in a 4 year coma she wakes up to find her baby did not survive and sets out to seek revenge on all of the team members saving bill for last it is an epic violent journey that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish,cruel
this was my first film what ive seen from the quentin tarantino masterpieces and when ive watched it i was 15 years old and i said thats awesome everybody said theres a lot violence in this movie and i think they say it right guys this is tarantino violence strong language beautiful story and beautiful frimes nobody can copy him the story is unique a the bride uma thurman is beautiful  and she just wants one thing d nobody can stop her if you try she cuts your neck if you watch the vol1 you cant say no to watch the second episode in the one night because you wants to see the end of the story and bills corpse d,cruel
oozing originality hilarity suspense and style vol 1 is the perfect representation of tarantinos prowess its equal parts laugh out loud hilarious and incredibly over the top but it never forgets its place and is amusing the entire way through the action and choreography is absolutely stunning especially the battle featuring the crazy 88 the soundtrack is also notable mainly for its strangeness stylistically its goofy as heck but its that zany tarantino humor that truly makes the audience laugh out loud there are a couple of issues i have with writing here and there but its easy to forgive these faults for the rest of the adventure is nutty and incredibly entertaining its safe to say that it is one of the most entertaining flicks if you dont mind gallons of red paint ever crafted one that confines itself to no boundaries and leaves no stone unturned in the brides quest for revenge,cruel
the way i see uma thurman play the bride in this actionpacked martial arts movie was not exactly clearcut but thinking about all of the charles bronsons death wish movies i think vol 1 was a definite allusion to the death wish movie sagathe gist of the story focuses mainly on the bride who survived a mob hit by several members of an assassination squad which included cottonmouth which killed 9 members of a wedding party at a church with the bride being a sole survivorafter waking up from the neardeath attempt by this killing squad she recalls all of the names of the five people involved including cottonmouththen the focus goes right into the brides main death wish as revenge for the murder attempt on her by this squadmore specifically to make a hit on the character cottonmouth also known as oren ishii the rising tension of this focus on three main thoughts by the bride1 the bride narrates a bit of the past on oren who grew up in a nasty japanese culture of the yakuza mob and was able to kill off some of her family members by surprise when they caused oren trouble in the past then the bride said that she went up to the ranks to become one of the top assassins and then was accepted into the 5person death squad later on who almost killed her2 next the bride then heads off to okinawa to meet up with hattori hanso at his swordsmiths place and even with her notsoperfect japanese she was able to get from hanso the weapon that will also be a focus for the sequel vol 2a long sword handmade by him called a katana which was used in both samurai and ninjitsu martial arts in japan3 then just before the showdown at the house of blue leaves as the bride comes to tokyo where oren was the bride narrates the main people in orens mob like charlie mo and his crazy88 fighters and gogo orens bodyguard also mentioned is boss tanaka who mentions orens translator sophie about being a halfprostitute during a mob council just before oren quickly decapitates tanaka for mentioning thatto tell how evil oren isto set up the end of oren the bride kidnaps sophie presents her to oren and then slashes one of sophies arms off to provoke oren to the brides final series of fights with that the hattori hanso sword is her angel as she kills off about 15 fighters almost get killed by gogos markiri spikeladen meteor attached with chain but still gets a chance to finish off gogo and kills off or maims 80 more fighters including charlie mothen the final duel between oren and the bride takes place oren sees the hanso sword the bride has and says that sword was a fluke as the fight starts orens katana was good enough to slash the bride to a near killbut the bride then gets up and then the bride finally slashes one of orens legs oren then says sorry for persecuting the bride and then the fight continues and then the bride finally kills off oren with a slash that cuts off half of her brain oren realizes as she falls and dies that the hanso sword was real after allthen the bride stands in a redemption prayer pose as snow falls in what was orens big yard of the housethe final part focuses on the brides warning to sophieif you do not tell all of the information on the rest of the assassination squad sophie will end up like what happened to cottonmouth the bride then takes a jet out of tokyo and revises the death list marking off cottonmouth to indicate that she was killed and targeting the main person on her death list for the movies sequelwhich is bill,cruel
do you like references are you a fan of martial arts films from the 70s do you like blood and gore if yes to all these then you have probably seen this film if no then this isnt really a film for youquentin tarantino has a tendency to make nonlinear films and he does them very well volume 1 is no different to most of his films it features heavy amounts of gore and a very very interesting story i dont know what it is about the story in this film which makes it different though maybe its because unlike his other films the nonlinear aspect is very straight forward and links beautifully to the characters own development talking about character my god this film has beautiful characters uma thurman is actually rather striking although the film starts with her more innocent side it quickly morphs into her violent no mercy side such dynamic emotion is very well done and written also the cold hearted nature of bill is creepy yet you feel empathy for him when he communicates with the assassins cinematics now the 1970s martial arts style taken on actually adds beautiful comedy to the otherwise very serious mix for instance whenever the bride sees one of her assailants the screen goes red klaxons go off and it cuts to a flashback moments like that just make me wanna go f yeah the use of swooshy and punchy fighting sound effects sound so cheesy yet so satisfying my favourite sequence the end massacre when o ren and the bride fight in a snow covered japanese gardenthe shortcomings are the same as the things which make it brilliant at times it just feels like the gore is overdone plus the comedy sometimes ruins the pacing of action sequences although easy to overlook these can ruin the experience for someso 810 overall goodlooking good fun and good god with a bit of a ruined experience at times good show,cruel
vol 1 is a quentin tarantino film that is filled with violence and bloodshed this film begins with the bloody massacre at wedding in a church in this massacre the pregnant bride beatrix kiddo played uma thurman is shot in the head by a man named bill played by david carradine whom is not shown kiddo then awakes in a hospital four years later to with no child kiddo then kills the attending nurse and begins her hunt for the person responsible for the massacre at her wedding it is then learned that kiddo was a member of the deadly viper assassination squad and she begins to hunt and kill the other members and the employer of the squad named bill whom was the father of her childthe theme of this film is that a mother will avenge the death of close family and that of her child if they are taken from her throughout the film the theme is recurring because the film progresses through the journey that kiddo takes to avenge the death of her child bill had ordered the massacre because kiddo had left him and tried to secretly marry another man bill had ordered the massacre because of kiddos betrayal in the beginning of the film a scene shows that bill had intended to kill kiddo if she only awoke from her coma the fight scenes in this movie have similarities to kungfu with highly choreographed actions the violence throughout the films is also similar to other tarantino films such as pulp fiction the editing of the film plays into the lineage of the plot because it shows the movie progress and answers questions that arise throughout the film shifting from time lines past present and future show the progression of the film while showing understanding of the plot in one of the out of sequence killings kiddo is shown slaying vernita greene played by vivica a fox kiddo kills greene in front of greenes daughter and tells her that she could seek revenge if she wanted when she became an adult this plays back into the theme because it shows the true devotion of revenge of a mother to kill another mother in front of her own child this scene personifies the theme and shows the true meaning of hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,cruel
the most visceral nonstop gladly wanton orgy of violence ive ever seen not to mention one hell of a stylish compilation of influence and homage like a cinematic wanderlei silva this is an action picture that just does not stop throwing haymakers until its finished and i love it for that simpleminded dedication to its own nature uma thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the doublecrossed professional killer on a blood vendetta as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod the plot is simple enough with thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads shes out to collect with her from scene to scene but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player though its sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash the storys split doesnt bother me a bit in a way its an appropriate intermission as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each others way masterfully orchestrated chaos its impossible to turn away from the brides classic exaggerated fight scene with the crazy 88s,cruel
the bridebeatrix kiddoblack mamba uma thurman was a member of an assassination team called the deadly viper assassination squad the deadly viper assassination squad included oren ishii lucy liu vernita green vivica a fox elle driver daryl hannah bill david carradine and budd michael madsen while on this team the bride falls in love with the teams leader bill where a child is conceived after she learns of her pregnancy the bride decides to leave the assassination squad and flees to texas to start a new life while in texas the bride meets a man and they decide to get married during the wedding rehearsal bill and his team of assassins show up and gun down everyone in the church including the bride four years later the bride awakes from her coma and finds that the baby she was carrying is now gone it is then that the bride seeks nothing but revenge upon those five people who are responsible for destroying her life and taking the life of her unborn child thus beginning vol 1,cruel
i just watched it again maybe with not enough time having passed by since my last viewing because i could not enjoy it as much as i thought but i was well entertained and remembered why i liked the film in the first place so i went on to have a look at the ratings and reviews on imdb and i was confused there almost seem to be only two very different opinions to vol1 whether people praise it as a masterpiece and a rating of 1010 or they hate it and describe it as an awful movie neither one nor the other i can fully comprehendi think that as a whole is not exactly tarantinos best film in terms of putting together details homages etc pulp fiction may be better and if it comes to good filmmaking i would always say jackie brown is his best film in my opinion one major mistake was to split the film into two parts that is probably the reason why so many people complain about vol1 lacking a real plot to me the two parts only make sense as one film and i can imagine that it even would have been way better edited if it had been released as one it could have been a great tvseries of 5 to 10 episodes too though however the more serious and epic feel of the second part is a great compensation for the endless crazy88choreography that really bored me to death this timewatched back to back this is still a pure tarantinoexplosion with a great comicbooklike story despite all the obvious italowestern and kungfu influences it feels like tarantino making a graphicnovel adaption of a graphicnovel written by himself and thats great  because it seems that this is exactly what it wants to be and this is by far better than most of the real comicbookmovies especially the gritty ones i do not really understand people who claim to be fans of tarantinos earlier work and totally dismiss this one because its pure tarantino it is pulp and it is fiction the only difference is it is not about gangsters and idiots it is about a straightforwardrevenge so there is less dialog and more blood but therefore it is bigger and splashier and you can see that the director did not do that because he is not capable of good writing he did it because he had great fun with itthe two different kinds of reviews on vol1 reflect the two main views on quentin tarantino himself displayed in the comments on this site while many people praise him to be a genius others accuse him of having stolen all his ideas from other work and being uncreative i grew up with his movies pulp fiction was my introduction to more serious adult and independet films so i loved it when i was 13 and i still loved it when i was 18  for different reasons and when i was 23you get the idea so i saw all his films and the ones he is related to a couple of times i can say that i know him as a filmmaker i know what to expect i know that hes not a genius or a wunderkind hes not as well educated in terms of filmmaking like a polanski for example he never went to a film school so i think he steals from other movies just like other directors steal from their teachers he makes only the movies he wants to make and when he has a vision he realizes it in the way he learned it i do not see him as the visionarysuperclevergenius who is the only one who can deliver great homages to genrecinema and filmhistory but i also can not see how someone can call him uncreative or unoriginal he is obviously a passionate highlycreative uncompromising filmmaker with great technical and stylistic skills  by the way if you think a certain mr avary was more important than tarantino for pulp fiction just look at the mess that is killing zoe  and is another proof for that is not as decent and smooth floating as jackie brown and it is not the reinvention of its genre and new found template for hundreds of imitations like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but it is a great fantasytale about a woman who wants nothing more than revenge until she finds out that there is something else she needs to have and it is so great so big so wellmade that it is much more than just a genrehomage that is what all the other zombie and gorefilmmakers do here you have more than that and a certain amount of quality and style you do not have to be a diehardtarantinofan to like it you do not have to praise him at all you only have to like what he likes and let him have fun so you can have fun too then recommended by me as a whole film will be a great ride,cruel
volume 1 is a really good action film clearly quentin tarantino loves martial arts films particularly the ones from bruce lee it has great action scenes and amazing choreography the fight at the end between umu thurman and lucy lius henchman is one of the best action scenes from the past decadethe only problem i have is this film has the best action scenes and volume 2 has all the talking in my opinion it should be the other way roundoverall if you like martial arts or samurai films you should definitely check this film out,cruel
is pure unadulterated quentin tarantino self indulgence and although i think that tarantino should have found a way to make both volumes into one film i still love this movieuma thurman is the perfect actress for this film and its enough to make you wanna go out and buy a yellow and black jump suit is comic book cinema at its very best directors that try to make comic books into film would do good to see how qt does it first gallons of blood  superb martial arts  a wonderful script and some fantastic acting all make the ingredients of a memorable film oh and the brilliant soundtrack helps too i cant wait to see the second volume and if memory serves me right  its even better than the first,cruel
many people who watch the film vol 1 will see it as nothing more than an action film with no artistic value however anyone who has ever taken a film class or who has a genuine appreciation of the artistry and thought process which goes into the making of a film will quickly recognize that vol 1 is more than a simple action film from the very beginning the film hooks the viewers attention this is not accomplished with elaborate fight scenes car chases or explosions rather a simple blank screen and a few sound effects get the viewers attention in a way seldom accomplished after the films opening the story proceeds in a nonlinear structure in medias res and tells the tale of black mamba aka the bride uma thurman thought to have been killed in the opening scene who goes about getting her revenge on those who sought to kill her black mamba spends a significant portion of the film seeking a sword which will not fail her in her quest for revenge almost as if she were king author seeking the holy grail black mamba travels to japan to obtain a master crafted sword the theme of swords being an honest killers tool is seen over and over as black mamba walks through airports and gets on plains with hers and no one seeming to mind although a sword may not be a practical weapon for an assassin they do have a period neutral feel that coincides with many of the films period neutral costumes through a series of flashbacks information is gradually filled in providing the viewer with the story leading up to the untimely demise or so we thought of black mamba in the films opening scene one by one black mamba gets her revenge on the individuals who sought to kill her while at the same time seeking information as to the whereabouts of her former lover and attempted murderer billthe film is a period piece set in the late 1970s or early 1980s which allows the films creator quentin tarantino to give the film a very unique look many of the vehicles in the film are vintage to that time period however most of the characters costumes have a rather period neutral appearance to them the occasional placement of an item from that time period provides interesting accents to the film without distraction from the films story costumes and props aside vol1 has many artistic traits that make it more it appears some viewers may not care for the films cliffhanger ending however the climatic last question posed by bill at the films end allows the film to end on both a high and low note even a person who may not be interested in action movies should view the film and try to appreciate it for its artistic value if not for its swordfightsjohn sellers,cruel
vol 1 offers anyone who is anxious for high drama films that offer a character based theme lots of action and little twists along the way uma thurman portrays an bride with a vengeance throughout this film she does not have a name throughout the whole movie the plot includes her attempting to seek revenge on many of her fellow assassins for trying to kill her and taking her baby the producer director and writer quentine tarantino does an excellent job at not only offering a great single idea plot but also includes great sound effects scene selection background effects and lighting one example is the angry sirens that seems to go off in the brides head as her anger and killing attitude begin to flare this gives the viewer the awareness that a huge action scene is about to take place as quentin tarantino did an excellent job within the same genre with pulp fiction this movie will offer the adult looking for some way to vent their frustrations a way to get out through uma thurmans character in the movie,cruel
quentin tarantino is one of the greatest and most consistent film directors around dont forget eccentric this film is no exception of the high quality expected of his works it is easily one of his most accessible films and an exciting cinematic piece of art the premise is simple the bride undertakes an epic journey of revenge having to defeat four professional assassins before reaching her ultimate prey that is bill you have to understand bill had his heart broken by her and thus he had no choice but to slaughter her fianc her fiancs family and of course her as well conveniently done by putting a bullet through her head however she miraculously survived and thus the stage is set for an ultimate tale engorged with spiteful vengeance honestly i seriously doubted that i would derive any pleasurable enjoyment from this it didnt quite sound like my cup of tea but if you put morals aside kids revenge is bad is a highly engrossing actionpacked flick that never ceases to entertainuma thurman delivers a spoton performance as the main character angstfilled and extremely frustrated but equipped with fierce determination this lady means business and you know better than to get involved when she starts wielding a samurai sword chopping limbs and heads off as if it were second nature  no its probably more like first nature in vol 1 she faces two of the four assassins but it is the second assassin oren ishii played by lucy liu which the majority of the film involves  an animestyle flashback sequence of her childhood is ingeniously craftedthe highlight of the entire film is a lengthy fight between the bride and oren ishiis henchmen in a japanesestyle night club reminiscent of the matrix reloadeds battle with multiple agent smiths it is epic beautifully choreographed and shot i was unable to draw my eyes away from one of the most spectacular fight sequences ive seen unfortunately the bride and oren ishiis showdown at the end was overshadowed by this sequence extremely disappointing but considering the rest forgivablethis is also easily one of the top three most violent bloody and gory films ive seen for those with weak stomachs stay far away from this one it is a film that glorifies the aestheticization of violence from start to finish i wasnt able to appreciate the violent extremeness as much as other viewers or critics  which i suspect is a good thing i havent been fully desensitised yet  but i do understand the reason it is called stylish art despite being unnerving at times it was very pretty to watch ah what has our generation come to describing excessive violence as pretty and stylishthe film pays multiple homages to different film genres and cultures the most apparent in vol 1 being japan with samurai swords and japanese dialogue prevalent tarantinos films always contain the right music the soundtrack never failing to invoke the particular emotion he wants to draw from the audience usually nervewrecking suspense thrill and shocking excitement when the credits came rolling on i was a bit thrown off at the abrupt ending even feeling rather cheated thats it then i remembered this is just vol 1 needless to say i was ready and eager for vol 2 bring it on tarantino,cruel
an assassin discovers her surprise pregnancy and decides it is best to leave her organization without notification upon the awareness of her existence the organization finds and attempts to murder the bride during her very own wedding rehearsal after taking a bullet in the head and lying dormant in a coma for four years the bride awakens with the taste for blood she instantly begins her quest for complete revenge on all of those present during her rehearsal the bride is a killing machine stopping at nothing to get the reward she wants bill vol 1 starring uma thurman as the bride lucy liu as oren ishii and vivica fox as vernita green tells the story of an assassins revenge against those who attempted to murder her but it does so much more than that as well this film was wonderfully directed and edited there is a variety of camera work done that really adds personality to the movie for starters there are various inandout closeups done there is some highkey lighting and grainy camera work that i enjoyed as well,cruel
quentin tarantino is back with a fresh masterpiece this movie was a blast and im not even joking the story went fluently and uma thurman was perfect for her role the fighting scenes were epic and had a hell load of blood but thats what makes movies funi loved every single part and some people say quentin tarantinos movies are boring but they are definitely not there were some funny moments in this movie too i loved when uma thurman pwned all the asian soldiers i love when she fights all the main bad guys i cant wait till i see volume 2 my ratings story 9510 effects 910 character 1010 overall 1010 have fun with this movie,cruel
once again quentin tarantino has made itafter reservoir dogspulp fiction and jackie brown he makes an unbelievable masterpiece divided into two parts the movie starts with a pregnant womanuma therman in a wedding dress being shot in the head by someone called billfortunately she doesnt die but falls for four years in commait is revealed that before she wakes upher senseless body was being raped day by day over paymentthen action starts with the woman waking up and killing the two rapistsafter spending many hours of practicing in order to bring her feet in life and killing one of her executioners starts her journey in order to get revenge of the guys that killed everybody in her wedding but considering herself failed to get the job done first of all she finds the famous katana maker hattori hanzosonny chibaand gets the best sword he has ever createdfinds the notorious o ren ishiiwhose story is being revealed in some great mangalike violent scenes as well as her gangsthen the party beginsin the following extremely violentgory yet stylish scenesthe bride kills ishiis whole gangthe crazy 80 and in the end ishii herselfthe movie ends with the bride sending ishiis best friend and member of the deadly viper assassination squadthe ones that killed everyone in the brides weddingcompletely severed to bill in order to inform him that she is coming to kill him to sum up vol1 is a true masterpiecegreat scenariodirectionactors playing and of course superb soundtrackin other words typical tarantino,cruel
the first vol in is basically a stylized violence with a mix of many styles tarantino is inspired by but its still well crafted although it doesnt have much substance and the dialogue isnt that great which tarantino films are known for it also follows tarantinos trademark of not going in the chronological order which makes the film better because it gets more anticipating to find out how uma thurmans character got to those points the first vol starts out with a bang literally and metaphorically its action packed with a lot of blood and fighting mainly in order to get the audiences attention i also liked the mix of asian cinema style in this but gives it his own style a bit the visual and the style is the main highlight of this movie and its mainly the reason i enjoyed this movie not one of my favorite tarantino movie but its still a pretty good vengeance film810,cruel
is an amazing movie the acting and direction is perfect and it couldnt have been any better if it werent for quentin and uma i cant imagine anyone else directing this or anyone else playing the bride they way both did respectively i know when any person first hears a movie where its like okay weve got a hot chick with weapons and shes gonna kill fiftysomething people they think that sounds stupid and predictable which sure the ending may have been a little predictable but when a movie is this good that doesnt matter they way quentin puts in such tiny details yet every single one fits in with the plot somehow and the way the fight scenes are choreographed and how theres always a few funny lines of dialogue here and there such as the little classroom scene where the brides name is revealed and how it has mixed elements of almost every different type of movie genre out there and ah i dont know just everything about this movie is amazing and should definitely be seen by anyone who loves these types of movies,cruel
i had always heard great things about this movie but for a long time i was hesitant i was born in 1992 so im kind of back tracking threw film history so to speak seeing as pulp fiction had been so well done i decided that this film should be just as exhilarating and to my pleasure i must say what audiences get is a very different type of movie let alone martial arts film so many movies today lack any real style this was just awesome to watch for that reason alonethis movie tells a revenge story that is obviously heavily influenced by 73s lady snowblood and to very good effect tarantino shows a clear deep respect for the film especially threw lucy luis character oren ishi as well as uma thurmans the bride the characters here are much better drawn out and are played very well each with their own interesting story line the opening fight is amazing and manages to sum up all these different emotions into the first few minutes of the film its quite frankly impossible not to enjoy the rest uma thurman plays a character known simply as the bride who will have to face down some of her former allies who apparently doublecrossed her for leaving the divas deadly viper assassination squad among her foes are great actors including vivica a fox and michael madsen all leading up to the final confrontation with bill played by david carrdine and although you have to wait till volume ii to see that this film sports some heavyhitting action it reminds you of those classic kungfu and samurai movies done with a fresh twist that leaves you amazed really the violence is cartoonly overdone in the same light of many of those epic and very bloody classics its a factor i actually enjoy and the crazy 88 battle is for sure one thing among many crazy the music some of which is provided by the rza  is original and i must say our director has an odd but well placed taste for this department along with the humor tarantino also does his usual outofsync time line gig which is a tad distracting in this film upon first viewing but youll appreciate it more every time the thing about this film is that it pays much deserved tribute to a category of films that are so under appreciated these days to see it in american cinema done so artistically was just fresh involving and unique way to present,cruel
quentin tarantino brings another unique movie in itselfthe first movie i have seen thats been described in chaptersbut it was so memorableso much gory filled scenes  sword fighting at its bestbut some scenes are just impossiblethats the only fault i could find in thisbut again thats what cinema is all aboutthe casting is pretty goodwith uma thurman leading from the frontfine performance from herlucy liu also has given a fine performancerest of the cast is pretty goodthe music is pretty cooladulations for quentin tarantino for directing such a fantastic filmits so damn uniqueits the basis for many new films to come in the futurethe best scene in the movie is that of uma thurman fighting out the crazy 88sand then there is bill at the endstill remember the dialogthis is me at my most masochistic,cruel
the clearest indicators for how much i like a movie are these two things how many times i can watch it in a short time period without it losing its appeal and the number of things in a movie that i think could be changed or removed in order to make it better the first volume of does better in those aspects than any other movie ive ever seen this is the best representation of what i feel are tarantinos best qualities as a writer and director with not a glimmer of the admittedly minor problems i can have with him the soundtrack is stylish cool and fits every scene like a glove the action shifts tone from brutally realistic to gloriously overthetop while always perfectly complimenting the story being told the cast is perfect the characters are memorable the story is simple but effective and the manner in which it is told only serves to enhance it theres no other way to say it i simply love the movie others may not agree and i certainly acknowledge that volume 1 may not appeal to everyone but i dont think ill ever be able to get enough of it this is my favorite movie ever,cruel
tarantino gives us one of the most memorable action heroines in the history of cinema she goes by the names black mamba the bride beatrice kiddaand more while the first movie sets up the scene offering plenty of awesome action sequences the second movie takes the time to develop the character but more on that later on while vol 1 follows the similar trademark that made tarantino popular that is mixing moments of clever and amusing dialogues with sudden action sequences eg pulp fiction deathproof one of the many reasons why i think hes a great filmmaker is because most of the time he stays true to the characters at first glance some of them might appear formulaic but then the viewer notices that theres more than what meets the eyes his films often have strong female characters and is no different uma thurman is an excellent choice and she immortalizes black mumba by making the character unforgettable darryl hannah and vivica fox are just as convincing as her badass nemeses lucy liu is good too but i thought she could have breathed more fire to make oren ishii more convincing on the technical side the soundtrack has almost always been a plus in tarantinos films and vol 1 has some great music the cinematography animation and editing are top notch the director was clearly influenced by various kinds of cinema japanese martial arts italian cinema brian de palmas thrillers and many western classics and with he pays homage to those filmmakers all in all this is one kickass film with a lot of action emotion violence humour and culture what more can one ask for where entertainment is concerned now im off to watch vol 2,cruel
there are so many things right about vol 1 but let me focus on one of the best aspects tarantino makes you so enthralled you want more so much moreone of my biggest complaints about movies is the length and not knowing when to shut up rarely will i say the opposite though children of men needed to be so much longer or a series heck ive even complained about other tarantino movies being too long inglourious basterds but vol 1 is just perfect in pacing and longing he masterfully made us wanting more or vol 2 and im not just talking about the absolute spoiler in the final few seconds the whole thing seems quick enough with barely a down minute and gives enough background to know there is so much more to this story lineplot line the bride is immediately assassinated in the opening and immediately reveals her unborn baby is the ultimate killer bills then the movie moves fastforward reverse and inbetween much like tarantinos other work ie pulp fiction its not easy for the average moviegoer but i felt he made it a lot smoother and easier to follow this time aroundtarantino gives enough background on what led her to the el paso church where she ultimately died and why she eventually wakes from a fouryear coma to seek revenge on the five responsible for her and her unborn childs attempted murderin vol 1 you get to see her vengeance on green fox in front of greens daughter  spoiler alert this is supposedly the setup for a vol 3 in years to come and ishii liu in between she kicks some ass on bystanders and loyal gang membersthis movie is tarantino at his best the best he wants to be a grindhouse voyeur an excellent storyteller you cant take this movie seriously its silly in a lot of ways but thats the grindhouse in tarantino and this leads me to another fantastic quality of vol 1 thurmandespite the foretold silliness thurman as the bride does an excellent job and in my opinion at least an oscarnominated acting job she brought extreme realism to an otherwise campy character out for revenge and you wanna know another perfect quality about her tarantino makes you root for her despite her being a ruthless assassin a real badassgali dont want to give away too much about the plot subplots or scenes in the movie but almost everything works in this movie music score style acting originality suspense action cinematography dialogue and uses of both color bw and anime this is tarantino at the top of his gameto expand i loved this movie the action was tight the movie was extremely well paced the music both score and soundtrack was wonderful the choreographed scenes were fun to watch the twists exciting the dialogue and writing was pitchperfect i would say this was his best work if not for his even better earlier works jackie brown pulp fiction or reservoir dogs or movie to come vol 2just remember the origins of this movie its basically an explicit japanese exploitation martial artsrevenge movie and you can get past the silliness the plotholes such as how she always seemed to have money and no one ever investigated her murders ie buck during her multihour recover scene speaking of which why were her upper muscles so accessible while downbelow were so well weak word of advice dont look too deep enjoy the master tarantino and sit back have fun and look forward to the sofar conclusion in vol 2,cruel
quentin tarantino according to me is the finest filmmaker of this generation i am a huge huge huge fan of his right from his masterpiece reservoir dogs vol 1 is milestone of a filmblame the legend for making absurd  weird films but no one can deny his astounding talent vol 1 has a plot that is as thin as paper but the presentation  execution leaves you awestruck no it doesnt end theres a second but this one overpowers the latterbe it the characters be it the violencegore or the wacky performances in my eye this is the finest revengedrama of this decade a true masterpiece tarantino is a legend of a filmmaker and theres not even a half percent doubt on it hes just outstandingthe actors are superb uma thurman is fantastic as the bride lucy liu is classy late actor david carradine is excellent as bill daryl hannah is firstrate as the one eyepatched bh michael madsen stands out others are perfect and ya bang bang is one of the finest songs evervol 1 is outstanding work of cinema two big thumbs up,cruel
since the day i started watching tarantino films by god he never lets you lose focus of the story he wants you to pay attention to whats happening on screen nonstop pounding sword dicing action that only here to please you one thing for you viewing pleasure the art of action vol1 contains a simple but yet very complex tale of revenge themed movie that sets out what it sets out to do to and yes violence everywhere guts spilling off limbs flying god knows where swords swooping a kicking on every scene every shot every scene are executed extremely well incredibly stylized visuals and camera movements that honors every influence that tarantino watched when he was learning how to do films on his own i mean not just taking stuff from the west but from east as well marrying together to make a well crafted action film though with slightly depth in the story telling and plotuma thurman eventually did an amazing job playing the character of the no nonsense exassassin on a mission bloody violence and revenge for the one he loved the most the other rest of the cast also did very well in their performance lucy liu should be credited too angela basset was really convincing in this role as both a mother and a assassin which to me spells as a no brainer but delightfully it did balanced well while not much to say about this part of there are a few scenes where the movie reveals some details and backgrounds of some the characters though ive said theres not much we can talk about in this part its more action driven and a feast for the visuals all i can give you based on what i felt revenge is best served cold fellow audience rated 85 out of 10,cruel
the movies are two of my personal favorites for the simple reason that they are fun to watch all of the characters are welldeveloped and likable and the acting is great uma thurman was perfectly cast as the bride and the late david carradine does an excellent job as bill at least for the few times we see himall of the assassins that go after the main character in this all have their own personalities and characters which is something you seldom see in an assassinrevenge film most of the time all the assassins are virtually identical maybe with a few minor differences but in the movies thats not the case theres budd who is basically a stereotypical redneck vernita a very aggressive vixen who looks like an innocent stayathome mom at first sight gogo a seemingly sweet little school girl with a nasty weapon and many other unique assassinsfrom everything i have said so far this sounds like nothing more than a normal old revenge action film that just so happens to have good acting but believe me when i say that there is a lot more to this movie and the next than that i could type much more to convince you of this but you need to see the movie for yourself you wont regret it,cruel
style over substance is the underlying theme of vol 1 the first segment of quentin tarantinos twopart kungfu flick the movie drops you straight into the action allowing the plot to unwind in a nonlinear format along the wayuma thurman brings her raw physical performance to the screen breathing life into a character written for her her mysterious character has a checklist of people she plans to kill driving the seemingly basic and obviously violent plot forwardthe movie is extremely violent but in a beautifully stylized way that has never before been achieved onscreen the visual stimulation of the stunts and effects distracts the viewers never allowing them to fully grasp the grisly nature of the senseless killings until after the spectacle has ended another great achievement in american cinema by its greatest fan and veteran quentin tarantino hats off to vol 1,cruel
what a spectacular dazzling piece of cinema genius i had known about this film for years and i regret that i waited so long to watch it one of the first of its kind taking samurai flicks adding a hint of secret agent assassin into the mix clash cultures between america and japan famous director quentin tarantino pulp fiction and this is the resultthe story revolves around a woman who is referred to as the bride her real name is not revealed in this movie because the lethal hitman and hitwomen league known as the deadly viper assassination squad killed the pregnant formerassassin at her own wedding led by bill the insane yet mysterious leader of the squad which the bride was once a part of instead of killing her like they thought she instead went into a coma not reemerging until 4 years later when she vows for revenge for her and her unborn child which she assumed had diedso the bride makes her way down or up if you like her hitlist starting with the gorgeous yet deadly oren ishii played by the dazzling lucy liu a japaneseamerican who took down almost the entire yakuza gang in her ultimate quest for power slowly she works way up the list which continues in volume 2 until the final showdown with her exboss and former lover bill the cast was stunning only uma thurman couldve played the beautiful but deadly hitwoman who takes it upon herself to brutally slaughter every last one of her betrayers lucy liu was fantastic beautiful graceful and exceptionally frightening in terms of swords she pulled off the japanese goddess of swords very well vivica a fox who we first see as copperhead her real name was vernita isnt seen very much overall but the way in which she is seen is exceptionally good she has a great sense of humor and intelligence and is the queen of surprises see the kitchen scene for clarification the plot and story were divine only quentin tarantino master of pulp fiction couldve crafted this wacky martialartsgonesamurai movie adding tributes to old slasher films japanese anime and spy movies i was so disappointed when it ended i wanted it to keep going on but i suppose thats what volume 2 is for this movie certainly isnt for all audiences as one person noted in their review it is exceptionally bloody and gory though it is often exaggerated so it really isnt that disgusting and very graphically violent the name suggests some type of gratuitous something or other so it obviously isnt a film you would show to your kids but if you love samurai movies or any other films in general then this is certainly one you dont want to miss i cant wait to see volume 2 and i hope bill gets just what he deserves 910 an instant classic,cruel
i am definitely not a fan of quentin tarantino the only films of his that i have seen are the two in the series i was interested in seeing them primarily because uma thurman and david carradine in the second one were the leads with an interesting supporting casttarantino has a thing about blood in these movies with the red fluid being sprayed copiously around the sets he also enjoys showing an outlandish amount of violence and the aftereffects of it i am not impressed by these features however there is something oddly intriguing about these films the drama the offcenter dialog the action scenes even with the blood and the storyline are fascinating the weird assortment of music enhances well each segment he also has a penchant for odd things such as using a sizable chunk of japanese anime flashes between color and blackandwhite inserts of titles for various segments offandon foreign language dialog with subtitles unexpected flashbacks and flashforwards and an otherworldly presentation in general the cast members do an excellent job in their roles and the makeup and costumes add a nice touch finally it is easy to sympathize with the main character and her quest for revengei saw the volume 2 film before i saw the volume 1 normally i would never do that on purpose but i had heard that the second one was the best and i had the opportunity to see it first i agree that the second in the series is better than the first but i was curious to see volume 1 anyway it appears to me that the first one was more bloody than the second although it is probably a close call i think tarantino is weird but i have to admit that he makes an interesting film even if its not really my cup of tea,cruel
i only watched it because it came to me at no cost im glad i didnt pay to see this its an uninspiring mish mash of bmovie styles and sensationalist story telling hadnt anyone told tarrantino bmovies were crap low quality celluloid pap i watched it so that i could be sure this is pap dont bother watching another bmovie again waste of timei did not enjoy it all his movies are rubbish people only pay to see his films because of hype and they want to believe that they are more cool for having seen itits not trueedit yes im quite harsh in my ranting criticism but watching this movie made me feel quite annoyed with the hollywood hype machine for having elevated tarrantinos films above their proper place,cruel
yes volume 1 is a definite exercise in style over substance but this isnt just anybodys style this is tarantinos style and what a style to possess if his preceding film jackie brown in 199798 was all characters and attention to detail spanning over two hours then is him letting his hair down and giving us an out and out visualfest of colour effects and violence delivered in double quick time well double quick compared to jackie brown and its brilliant study but tarantino had proved his worth when it came to out and out substance in films his attention to a love story and character development in jackie brown came after reservoir dogs and pulp fiction two of my favourite films told with such confidence and in such an entertaining way the latter of which has since embedded itself into modern folklore is stone wall proof that he can do it when he wantsits not that vol 1 is an example of tarantino not wanting to do what he can do but more so a relaxation of complicated and developed films with narratives about realistic people yes you can deem pulp fiction complicated even though it has inspired countless other films because there are some people even now that on a first viewing when not familiar with the genre and influences cannot fathom how one character can be alive at the end even though he shouldnt beon first view the film does come across as a flat out adventure a one lined journey about one person in a routine revenge narrative driven film but its this familiar template that tarantinos uses to place his own unique touches that he is so able to bring to a piece of text if pulp fiction was so memorable it was so for bringing life into an old genre full of stereotypes as noted by many here tarantino brings his own breath of fresh air or style to the well worn start revenge flick vol 1 begins with the sort of introduction you might not expect from tarantino certainly not from the very opening there is no long tracking shot of a static woman on a moving walkway or guys calmly sitting around a table discussing madonna instead we get black and white panting and a bloodied woman whose image is juxtaposed by the calm and methodical speech from a man named bill caradine a few lines of dialogue pass and the woman is shot in the headwhat develops is a revenge film as told from this womans point of view the bride thurman a nameless for now antihero on a mission that will see her have to undergo a process as she plots her way to the ultimate goal of revenge whats great about the revenge process from this position and similarly so in one of my favourite films entitled payback is that the antihero lead has just about nothing to loose and thus they go about their mission in just about the most ruthless and unforgiving way possible their enemies think theyre dead they accept theyve been to hell and back and nothing else could be as bad as their prior tragedy and they go hell for leather in trying to attain the status of eventhe bride visits vernita green fox after treading through some childs toys on a lawn miseenscene that leads the audience to realise it is a house that inhabits a child vernita opens the door and there is a flashback a tarantino trademark before a fight erupts immediately placing the audience in another juxtaposed situation this woman whose been shot in the head and has been through hell versus one of her enemies who it now seems has a young child there is a brief fight before vernitas childs bus stops outside and echoing the tactic in reservoir dogs during the ear scene there is a break in proceedings further plunging the audience into a realm of either frustration or unfamiliarity how many other films would have finished the fight and ignored the pitstop routine tarantino reannounces his style from here and continues throughout in a barrage of memorable scenesbut is really a furtherance in feminism the entire assassination gang bar budd madsen are female and the sexually active male nurse in the brides hospital wing gets his just deserts from said strong independent female lead who takes no prisoners a similar scene happens during a flashback scene involving the female japanese character of gogo kuriyama who asks the question who is penetrating who now as she kills another potentially sexually active male in a similarly nasty mannerthe film builds to a climax that certainly delivers but not after delivering flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks when introducing lucy luis oren ishii the character of bill is kept out of shot al marcellus wallace and talks elle driver hannah out of killing the bride while shes still in a coma because its not the honourable thing to do while clutching a samurai sword which of course epitomises the ideal of honour amongst ancient japanese warriors volume 1s final fight scene is all guts and gore but the images are juxtaposed with pinball noises and ten pins clattering as the light and colouring changes brilliantly and dramatically although my favourite touch is sophies dreyfus ringtone which is auld lang syne a song that includes the lyric should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind the brides reply would probably be a resounding no,cruel
well i reviewed this title on my website some years ago here i paste my original review because i think this movie deserves it this movie is like watching a liveaction japanese animation and no im not just talking about the animated sequence by production ig ghost int eh shell im talking about the entire movie i strongly recommend to everyone both movies but mostly volume 1 and mostly to anime lovers besides the samurai feeling and the japanese animation tribute there are many reasons why an otaku may enjoy this 1 character names curious little detail tarantino is taking some names right from a well known japanese video game company called snk first when the movie is about to begin and the credits are rolling we see one of the producers goro daemon goro daemon is a character from the popular video game king of fighters then at the movie we have hattori hanzo ninja from the samurai shodown video games2 uma thurmans yellow outfit is obviously a tribute to bruce lee great way to honour a kungfu legend if you ask me very well done3 gogo yubari teenage schoolgirls with powerful weapons that become fierceless warriors come on that was invented by japanese animators name any manga or anime you want youll have at least one of those girls tarantino you earned an a btw tarantino contacted chiaki kuriyama for the role after watching her at battle royale cult cinema film 4 sword fights positions movements samurai honour a visual delight for people that enjoy watching traditional samurai movies and animes like rurouni kenshin 5the blood and violence if you like gore perfect blue genocyber youd like blood in the movie looks fake enough not to become disgusting but at the same time real enough not to become ridiculous perfect balanceso as you can all see i really liked this movie and think that no otaku should miss it i love japanese culture and im an uma thurman fan luckily tarantino is fan of both things as well so this movie just rocksnot an anime fan dont care watch it anyways this movie is so fantastic that it has a little bit for everyone one of my favourite films if not the favourite one dont miss it,cruel
uma thurman kicks butt and sprays blood all over the screen in yet another gem from writerdirector quentin tarantino here tarantino pays homage to 1970s grindhouses old vintage chinese martial arts and japanese samurai movies as well as throwing in a little mix of sergio leone spaghetti westerns mix all together and you have one of the most outrageously entertaining movies of the decade that keeps you watching from the shocking opening shot the cliffhanger ending even if you arent a fan of japanese anime or chinese martial arts films dont watch it for that watch it for the great acting by thurman lucy liu vivica a fox and darryl hannah the breathtaking choreography during the crazy fight sequences and the mindblowing story that tarantino has put together to entertain and shock us vol i was excellent and i cannot wait to watch vol ii,cruel
few directors have established such an instantly recognizable style as quentin tarantino despite having only released a handful of works any of them can be immediately marked as a tarantino film by any of his trademark cinematic traits the stylized dialogue the edgy cinematic techniques and the macabre yet perversely entertaining violence having remained under the radar for a few years after having shaken the film industry by storm and spawned countless imitators in the early 1990s in 2003 tarantino was back with a bang with arguably his most visceral and gruesomely entertaining work to date  volume one using the simplest of story lines as a template for his latest bloodbath tarantino paints his story of an assassin gunned down at her wedding seeking revenge against the perpetrators with an operatic splendour utilizing all of his usual trademarks with pitchperfect intensity with a stylized script providing some of the most quotable lines since pulp fiction and coy experimentation with narrative form taking note and paying tribute to his usual multitude of nationalities and genres from 1970s japanese samurai films which the entire film is structured in the mould of to convoluted classic french narrative to continual innovations and experimentations in cinematic technique with use of chapters freeze frames eclectic cinematography and interludes to japanese anime or black and white tarantino is at the top of his masterful game the films typically quirky musical score making use of everything from classical samurai film themes to nancy sinatra to original works composed by independent artist the rza proves an odd compilation that exquisitely captures the bizarre and endlessly captivating essence of the film similarly no film would pulse with the essence of tarantino without copious use of violence which volume one delivers in spades while the mayhem is overdone to an almost comical extent with dismembered henchmen spouting torrents of blood oddly enough harking back to monty python several moments evoke such brutal and visceral intensity that even the most jaded viewers are likely to cringe however tarantino similarly displays his uncanny talent to draw dark humour out of the most unlikely situations wonderfully counterbalancing the very real emotional tension with unlikely humour such as a room full of maimed bodies moaning in a zombielike dirge in the midst of the mayhem it is easy to forget how hilarious the film can be however the superb fight choreography in particular the staggering half hour final showdown is breathtaking and astonishing in its intricate bloody splendour crafting some of the most elaborate and intensely engaging sword fight scenes in cinema history despite the jawdropping technical work and masterfully crafted script tarantinos film really comes to life through the incredible performances of his cunningly assembled cast giving a career best performance uma thurman is nothing less than flat out mesmerizing as the initially nameless bride diving into her performance with such raw intensity and extracting every last iota of emotion from the part thurmans powerhouse of a performance is the beating heart which keeps the film throbbing with life carrying both the audiences sympathies and enthralled enthusiasm with her every step of the way similarly lucy liu is enormously impressive as a smoothly psychotic assassin turned mob boss and watching her calm veneer melt into a captivating pillar of exposed fury is one of the films most terrifying moments daryl hannah and vivica a fox each enthrall given their moments to shine as two of the brides former fellow assassins as does julie dreyfus as lius oily second in command character actor sonny chiba is a delightful yet dignified presence as a mysterious retired swordsmith and chiaki kuriyama resonates with power as likely the deadliest schoolgirl ever beheld on celluloid seen only in a brief cameo setting up his role for the sequel michael madsen nonetheless makes a strong impression as an introspective assassin and david carradine is spellbinding as the never seen bill his silky voice winding itself around his lines like the deadly viper his assassination squad is named after  one of the most effective villains never to expose their face easily tarantinos strongest most visceral and ceaselessly stylish work since pulp fiction volume ones dialogue truly stunning cinematic style and technical work and myriad of tremendous performances especially the astonishing thurman cement it as one of the most effortlessly innovative and impeccably masterful films of the decade the effect of is truly astonishing even after multiple viewings the initial reaction of gutlevel shock and awe at tarantinos tremendous daring and perverse genius never wanes stylish sadistic cathartic fun  not for the faint of heart but for those capable of stomaching it is near peerless 1010,cruel
let me just get one thing out there this movie kicks ass that thought repeated through my head many times as i leaned back in my seat eyebrows raised and took in the film for the first timethere is little in the way of emotional attachment that might be for the best while you can certainly empathize at times uma thermans character the bride aka black mamba seems mighty grim as she pursues a quest of revenge against her former colleaguesthe plot like the title is laughable black mamba gets ambushed on her wedding day she survives drafts a hit list 5 names long and sets out to get her revengeso how could such a simple storyline with limited emotional involvement turn into 3 hours worth of sheer movie bliss quentin tarantino wrote and directed it thats how the genius is in the details theres an abundance of nasty surprises that will challenge your tolerance and keep you wide awake the slower interludes are loaded with tension intrigue and humorno ones lovable but everyone is memorable uma thurman is terrific in the lead you see her character from a few different aspects usually shes nasty and pitiless occasionally shes cute at one point she has an outburst of grief thats pretty riveting lucy liu is great as oren ishi the boss of the tokyo underworld while obviously lethal she somehow maintains this beautifully elegant almost fragile presence all decked out in her kimono her henchmen are colorful and imposing like the earlier james bond heavies bill david carradine is genuinely mysterious all the more so because they havent shown his face yetand then theres the action the combat is phenomenal in its execution and mindnumbing in its scope just when you think that has got to be it they keep piling it on one sequence is the new mt everest of kung fu seriously that alone is more than enough to keep this film on the map be warned its not harmless jackie chanstyle slapstick combat the blood and gore is overwhelmingas you would expect the music selections are devastatingly cool and they come from all over the map theres 70s funk pan flute w orchestra tex mex a japanese schoolgirl power trio you name itits not just the music thats eclectic is a very vivid fusion of american chinese and japanese genres at least these are the most visible elements  bear in mind that tarantino seems to have seen every movie ever made anywhere the japanese settings are stunning and theres an entire segment beautifully done in a japanese animation style called anime this degree of savvy and reverence for the region is extremely rare among western filmmakersall these elements are combined with great virtuosity to form a supremely entertaining movie thrill ride you never know whats going to hit next but whatever it is it is likely to saturate the senses and challenge the brain i didnt want for it to end but i must admit that level of intensity for 3 whole hours would be a bit much so i can understand why they split it into two installments some people bitch about the severance but i enjoyed volume 1 enough to see it twice and i cant wait to go shell out more dough and see volume 2most american action films indulge in their gratuitous carnage behind a veil of contrived morality this has come to irritate me enough to turn me off the genre one thing i find very refreshing in is the absence of such pretense its all thrills and spills no apologies no disguises no lecturescritics who object to this film seem to do so because it fails to pander to their various expectations heres a little news flash people its quentin tarantino if you go in expecting a repetition of his previous work or a movie that is in any way conventional andor predictable youre going to be disappointed  and you deserve to be i went expecting something bold exciting and original with plenty of violence and a few surprises i couldnt have been more delighted,cruel
i actually enjoyed many aspects of the film but it fails for the following reasons warningspoilerswhile i think lucy liu is a pretty good actress i loved her on ally mcbeal i think she is totally miscast in this role at no time did i believe she was an assassin and i never felt she was a threat to uma thurmans character this role cried out for someone like michelle yeoh an actress with a history of martial arts roles vivica fox and daryl hannah both conveyed the necessary physicality and menace but lucy looked small and weak in the final battle vs the bride the cartoonish squirting blood and unrealistic mayhem in the crazy 88 fight i know it was meant to be cartoonish and unrealistic but there has to be a certain amount of believability for an audience to buy into a movie and this scene with uma mowing down henchman after henchman just blew all credibility for the filmfilming out of chronological order i know it has become a tarantino trademark and it works brilliantly in reservior dog and pulp fiction but here its just confusing why not just present the saga of the bride as it happened the plot has enough drama without playing with the time line which brings me to my fourth point   style over substance tarantino is one of those directors who feels the need to constantly remind the audience hey look over here im directing this movie theres enough camera movement and fast edits in this film to give you motion sickness its like a 2 hour music video a well told story with some cinematic style is one thing  in the style overwhelms the story,cruel
i saw this film upon its release in 2003 and have to say that i wasnt impressed by it while the film definitely has entertainment value it lacks substance and didnt do much for me since then however ive seen a lot of the sort of films that tarantino took influence from when it came to this film and upon a repeat viewing of this first instalment of while my niggles are still there i enjoyed it much more this time around and have to say that tarantino definitely achieved what he set out to the film is an amalgamation of the sorts of films that tarantino loves all strung round a revenge theme clear influence comes from the martial arts pinky violence exploitation and western genres the plot is exceptionally simple and focuses on a wedding day massacre at the hands of a group of people known as the deadly viper assassination squad the only survivor of the wedding day massacre is the bride who despite getting shot in the head was not killed four years after the wedding day she wakes from her coma and vows vengeance on all those who spoilt her big daytarantino does his usual trick of not telling the story in a linear fashion and here we get a segmented chapter method of getting it across which works fairly well i would say that i am a fan of tarantinos style but at times he can be a little too quirky and it does his films no favours take the first fight scene in this film between uma thurman and vivica a fox  the idea of having the two women fight each other with household items is greatbut then the kid comes home from school and the whole thing is too unlikely to be believable the fight scenes are obviously the most important thing in a film like this and the aforementioned scene is good in spite of the mentioned problem other great fight sequences in the film are good too the bloodbath at the end being the most spectacular part with the preceding fight that sees uma thurman pitted against a ball and chain wielding japanese schoolgirl being the most interesting tarantino usually does casting well and this film is no different we also get a good soundtrack that fits the film well one of the bigger risks in this film is the animated segment and for me its not a good thing however despite my problems with the film its hard to deny its entertainment value and the amount of blood on display so much that certain scenes had to be shown in black and white is definitely a bonus too i wont say that this is a big favourite of mine but i am glad that i gave this film a second chance,cruel
quentin tarantinos series is a roaring revenge story about a trained killer uma thurman picking off the assassins group who brutally massacred her future family including her unborn baby the story is simple but dont be fooled tarantinos dual epic is a masterpiece of cinematic art beeming with visual vibrancy stunning cinematography and spinechilling musictarantino is renowned for his vivacious love of obscure cinema most notably kung fu and western cinema in that context is by far his most inspired picture  the film in its entirety is a rich homage to bruce lee and sergio leone tarantino describes as his spaghetti western his gritty saga of deceit and gore that would sum up the atmospheric power of the filmsas mentioned before is a dual epic split into two films for the interest of having a sensible film length yet the difference between the two volumes isnt just the name they differ hugely in style volume 1 is a more stylised orgy of violence and black comedy with simply chilling showdowns and minimal exposition where as volume 2 is a more mature piece of cinema telling the full story of the bride in this way we as viewers get the best of both worlds boundless entertainment and a smiggen of storyvolume 1 was always going to be a film that polarised critics style over substance was evident and unless a stuffy critic was willing to let his hair down and enjoy himself then he would have hated it that is what you have to do relax and admire the art of the film everything from the astonishing shot where we see vernitas daugthers bus arrive through the window to the final showdown between oren and the bride is shot with depth and passion tarantino is meticulous in his direction like pulp fiction he pays attention to detail the music is thrilling tarantino opts for funky music types matched with aggressive morricone scores a combination you wouldnt think would work but its invariably pulled offwhats great about volume 1 is that it doesnt take itself seriously some of the scenes are just so outrageous that we know its metacinema we know were watching a film in another world cinema is one of the finest forms of escapism and embraces that quality to the maximum this is presented both subtly and boldly resulting in a satisfying film to watch multiple times which i havevolume 1 is awesomely entertaining cinematographic art and marvellously inspiredabsolutely stunning910,cruel
revenge is a dish best served cold almost everybody knows this proverb but not necessarily its origin thats alright because nobody really knows where that famous phrase comes from not even the wellread quentin tarantino in the case where you wouldnt have noticed it klingon is the name of a race in star trek but seriously do you really think that im writing a review to discuss the origins of an expression that every school kid knows so its supposedly a dish best served coldyet tarantino perhaps unconsciously strikingly makes that proverb lying because revenge in vol 1 is not served cold but rather dangerously hot with flavors so explosive that sensitive stomachs will assuredly throw up their dinnereven well before he made tarantino was already known for his skillful conjugation of extreme violence and aestheticism we only have to think of the earslicing scene in reservoir dogs or toomanyscenestogiveaspecificone in pulp fiction tarantino completed his violent scenes with numerous references to popular culture in other scenes here tarantino puts popular culture aside and concentrates almost only on grape juice scenesthe simple story of revenge is complex nevertheless uma thurman plays the bride she is a member of the deadly viper assassination squad a team of assassins composed of herself and four other members their boss is named bill david carradine whose face is never revealed in this episodethe bride seems to have left the organization so she could marry and have a child but her former colleagues show up at her wedding and kill everybody they think theyve also killed the bride but she miraculously survives after being shot in the head even if her assailants cruelly took her baby off her bodyyou would have guessed it the bride then wishes to get revenge upon her former colleagues by killing them one by one and bill as well hence the title surprising isnt it this first episode shows the bride attacking vernita green vivica a fox and oren ishii lucy liufaithful to himself tarantino presents his story in a fragmented way just like if there was simply no other alternative to his methodsthe bride quickly liquidates vernita and we learn at the same time that oren has already been killed so the rest of the story is presented as a flashback and we know what will be the final result what we dont know is that tarantino is about to provide us with a breathtaking show of martial arts fights and extreme violence like nothing ever shown before in the history of cinematarantino really is a living encyclopedia of violence and ways of presenting it for almost two full hours the child prodigy from knoxville tn shows an exhibition of violent scenes and practically each one is different from the other ones with such an amount of violence naturalism quickly lets devolves into surrealism and at some moments shock and disgust become laughtervolume 1 is almost completely set in japan so its without any surprise that tarantino takes benefit of the occasion to pay tribute to japanese film genres and popular culture just by seeing what he had done before with other wellknown genres its not very surprising that qt concentrates on that kind of genre id even say that it was only a matter of timeand for a fan of japanese culture like myself i had a gorgeous feast it all begins with the short anime as surreal in its violence than the rest of the film a superb homagethe scenes where the bride drives her yellow motorcycle towards the streets of tokyo wearing a yellow suit are an homage to bruce lee but it also strangely reminisces the famous anime feature akira and the suit seems to come from the sentai subgenre which gave us the alreadyforgotten power rangerswe also have to remember that we cannot dissociate japan from video games the spike ball linked to a chain used by the young terror gogo chiaki kuriyama seems to be a reference to the early titles from the sonic the hedgehog franchisebut how could we forget the japanase sword fights this amazing spectacle provokes incredibly high thrills during minutes that fly away as fast as the heads of the brides victims tarantino shot nearly all of the fight scenes in the famous shaw bros studio in hong kong and called upon many action choreographers and martial arts specialists to recreate the atmosphere of old hong kong moviesits true that all of this stuff can shock tarantino is aware of it and even takes pleasure from it how then would you explain the final fight between the bride and oren why would it be shot in a cute and innocent japanese garden covered with pure white snow seeing this natural beauty we could almost shout out sacrilege when tarantino soils the snow with red bloodbut qt is pitiless he fully trusts his own skills and those of his crew we have to say that he really is prodigious he never slows down even if his last movie has been made in 1997for qt everything in his movies is a question of appearance its still true here besides the examples already mentioned we can add the megafight that suddenly goes from color to black and white and another one which takes place in a room plunged into darkness except for a blue screen in front of which fighters only look like dancing silhouetteswith such a beginning expectations are very high for the following i must confess that im barely able to wait,cruel
i watched once when it was shown on tv i was disgustingly amazed at how brilliant this film was although tarantino has done some complete turkeys like hostel but after losing faith has restored the poweris about a woman who gets revenge on the people who ruined her wedding day the film has some very over the top exxagerated gore which is cool and some excellent fightsthe first installment has got me fired up for volume two which i am still waiting for in delivery hopefully after succsses like this then tarantino will make grindhouse just as good or it might end up like hostel a steaming pile of ,cruel
i just cant say enough good things about this movie a real high octane thriller of a movie uma thurman plays the bride who after sleeping in a coma for 4 years after being left for dead seeks revenge from her killers tarantino offers a visual feast leaving subtle clues in each scene to tell the story bills hanker chief with his name on it but you cant see him death list 5 already has a name scored off it nice wee touches like that its not as dialogue driven as his previous movies its his bloodiest movie yet more action orientated but its done so well and so blatantly over the top theres also a manga style cartoon to tell the origins of one of the brides nemesis very over the top and violent and when it comes to the real life action its just as over the top the music is well picked and accompanies each scene perfectly one of the tracks used was a piece of music tarantino heard in a hotel lobby in japan only tarantino could choose so wisely the movie is a homage to japanese action movies like reservoir dogs its not 100 original nonetheless it doesnt stop it being a relentless action packed treat,cruel
tarantino is supposed to be a fan of modesty blaise he put a modesty blaise book into the hands of his john travolta character in pulp fiction and is rumored to be trying to make a blaise filmbut modesty blaise author peter odonnell never let his characters dodge danger by blind luck although i admire the slick styling of the plotting is a disgracehis sick heroine kills a hospital orderly wheels herself to his truck and drags herself inside then lies on the back seat for hours willing her paralyzed legs to work like the cops wouldnt think to look at the dead mans vehicle in the hospital parking lotand she arms herself with a magic sword which is so good she can defeat dozens of swordsmen by dancing around waggling itthe look of this movie is stunning the idea of switching to mangastyle animation to handle the sensitive subject of child abuse is brilliant if it had been given a clever disciplined plot this could have been one of the best films of all time,cruel
revenge is a dish best served cold after allfor the recipe that is consider quentin tarantino as a multimillion dollar blender who mixes the best of styles in his deep pool of talent take hong kong action bruce lee movies nostalgic 1980s ninja movies and mainstream highlights pour them into the blender and sprinkle the product with tarantinos own trademarks and rapidfire dialogue also pepper with film with homages and references finally coat the film in a rich glaze of adrenalinepumping decadently gory and heartstopping kinetics oh yeah and serve with a killer soundtrack coldneedless to say style alone cannot carry a film  no matter how sprawling with flair and fury it is therefore tells the compelling story of one womans revenge against her former assassincolleagues who on the day of her wedding marched into the church and killed everyone there including the brides fiance and her unborn baby however they botched their way through their most important task killing the bride now she wakes up from a coma four years later with one thing on her mind killing bill and the deadly viper squad who did this to her vol 1 thus tells the first half of the brides long bloody brutal and heartfelt journey for justice as she seeks out her enemies in parts of the worldfirst let me say that this is my favourite quentin tarantino film simply because it is a perfect amalgam of everything i like in both style and substance the colourful format mixed with blackandwhite visuals the brief anime sequences the chapter format the atmospheric and eerie soundtrack and finally the fantastic story of cold calculating vengeance  none of these components work on their own in the sense that their sole inclusion could support a film  but quentin stirs and melts them together with with a bafflingly good skill that completely floored by nonexistent expectations on top of this he applies an incredible kinetic energy to every part of which makes the occasional slowpaced and introspective pauses all the more poignantthe whole film is due to the aforementioned poised on the brink of overkill it needs to be said ideas and visuals are bottled up under a lid but bubbling to come up at all times it is enjoyable madness however vol 1 is not devoid of faults these are no overriding or fatal shortcomings but rather a small collection of scenes that simply do not work the detective scene with michael and james parks going into the el paso church after the massacre is incongruous and redundant serving little more purpose than to give tarantinos longtime friends their token cameos another scene that does not work for me is the dialoguedriven piece between thurman and fox in the kitchen after theyve got their bitches on in a worldclass catfight in the beginning their conversation feels staged longwinded and purposely plotpropelling not to mention far too formal given the context and the histories of the two charactersbut indeed these are minor slipups and with the amount of good weapons in tarantinos directorial arsenal one can hardly hold it against him even the uneven pacing of vol 1 is immediately forgiven when he plunges into to spinning martial arts violence and homaging goodies all filtered through his own creative and sick mind enjoy the coldly served dish8 out of 10,cruel
i had every intention of skipping this film when it was released you see movies with martial arts have never been on the top of my list regardless of who does it but this film came to me through word of mouth and once i saw it in the theater i could not wait to see volume 2 this is not your typical martial arts film but then again yes it is its humorous fun action packed and its lead character is a woman whos trying to piece her life back together after an unfortunate instance  the death quad she used to work for thought they killed her by all intents and purposes she should have been dead but she survived which is bad news for each of them because she is hot on the trail of finding them and her main bone of contention billher travels to get to the elusive bill is not without its fair share of pain and destruction for the heroine but this is what i like about films by quesntion tarrentino  there isnt a straight path to anything youre not quite sure of which of the events youre watching happened first but you are engrossed in watching to figure it outand on top of that you never know what era you are in when you are watching you have all of pop culture in your face and this film is no exception there is plenty here for the diehard martial art fans with cameos from some of the most known in the traditional martial arts films and for us that know a bit here and there okay i saw a few of the traditional bruce lee jet li and jackie chan movies there is stuff for us too  but even more creatively speaking its all here for those arent marital arts adapted the story is quite the womans story and the heroine meets up with some of the most strongest women ever along with the dirtiest of menyoull want to know what the deal is about the heroine and you begin to piece it together in this installment its not very pretty and youll have questionswhy did her group turn on her what happened to the baby she was carrying who is bill really and where is he and why is she driven to i just fell in love with this film its tarrintino at his top form and that is what makes it good entertainment,cruel
in the scene where copperhead and black mamba first meet from the viewers standpoint there is immaculate attention to detail that goes beyond accurate to the point of comedy ie copperhead fires a gun from the inside of a cereal box the name of this kids cereal you ask kaboom nuff said who else in this world can pay enough attention to cinematic detail that there is enough room left for a little bit of appropriate artistic license granted tarantino isnt in the same league as scorcese but thats just the point my only qualm with the entire movie is the close up shot of the gun firing anyone with even remote firearm experience knows the striations of the barrel cause the bullet to spin to maintain a straight trajectory thats the entire basis of bulletforensics other than that this film is a visual splendor,cruel
what can be said about quentin tarantinos some consider it a masterpiece others dont the only certain thing about this movie is that it loses its original intention in this movie tarantino tries too hard to make a sort of replica of the classic japanese samurai films combined with the wellknown martial arts movies this can be easily seen from uma thurmans clothing the yellow suit with the black line is featured in game of death featuring bruce lee the problem that this film represents is that in virtually every japanese movie of the types mentioned above youll never find massive senseless slaughtering because the fighting is actually not the main idea of those movies but the preservation of honor along with the demonstration of courage and skill certainly this movie has tarantinos style wellengraved in it i believe its been highly regarded by many because it has the name of a wellknown director and most supporters fail to find the true meaning and intention of the film just for reference you should watch a couple of akira kurosawas movies  see which style you like best,cruel
when i first saw this i thought it was great but since watching it again i see its short comings along the way there are some great moments and some great referencesbut the references are what also causes the films downfalls there are way too many and the film eventually becomes just one big injoke thats not to say that the film is complete rubbish and when the references work they really work it was great to see characters like earl mcgraw from from dusk till dawn again and the action scenes are usually great with plenty of over the top gore some great dialogue and a brilliant soundtrack but all in all a lot of it falls flatsome of the fights also let you down the fight against lucy lui and vivica fox feels uncompletedworth watching when its on telly,cruel
although not as great as tarantinos early work this movie has plenty of frenetic energy that makes his movies great the first half of seems to be a meditation on the highly underrated chop socky films out of hong kong during the 60s 70s and 80s in fact the whole film serves as a tribute to eastern culture with a slight nod to the westerns and blaxploitation despite its length the movie rarely slows down and manages to make one interesting scene after another the amounts of spilled blood along with the joke that the corpses of defeated foes dont simply disappear once defeated make this movie stand on its own as a true kung fu film the appearance of sonny chiba will have extra weight for fans of tarantino what emerges isnt so much a movie with emotional depth as much as a popcorn movie that doesnt stoop to jerry bruckheimer clichs as usual black comedy and injokes can be shifted through the carnage and most everything falls into place my only complaint would come from the choice of music during the winter garden fight i know it would probably be more clichd but i would have preferred a dead soundtrack punctuated only by the water spigot to the jarring 70s roller derby music other than that i have few complaints9 out of 10 not a romantic film,cruel
this movie is very highly overrated i am a fan of all of quentins work but this movie is really badit has no plot really besides she wants to and the acting is kinda terribleit is like they got a lot of good actors and told them not to act good for the movie and just act stupidit is a cool movie but besides the action scenes and the style of the movie there is not much to like about itfilms like pulp fiction were based more on good acting and well written scenes with violence when it was neededthis movie just is missing that i was very surprised that i did not like this movie and i think it is only worth watching on tvi was very shocked from quentin here,cruel
it has been quite some time since pulp fiction made me adore tarantino in the 90ies and even if jackie brown was sort of disappointing despite starring robert de niro my favorite actor i could hardly wait vol1 and this time i was delighted just the brides fight against the katanaarmed boy group was worth going to the movies twice actually even the greatest tarantino fan will have to admit that there are some minor weaknesses oren saying her last sentence with half her brain chopped off or the bride recovering way too quick after an endlessly seeming comacome on she should be unable to move for days considering her not having exerted a single muscle for years but if you ignore them and dont take the whole thing too seriously its just great fun its another of those love it or hate it  movies this if you enjoyed pulp fiction andor reservior dogs you shouldnt miss this one the sound track is as usual for tarantino very well fitting by the way i favor vol1 over vol2 probably because of the lack of blood shed in part two,cruel
i just saw this last night and loved it i was expecting something like jackie brown which i hated something slow and dry and bloody from what id heard of it but i was really surprised and in a good way the film leaves you guessing and a little tense at times and more importantly hanging at the end uma thurman and lucy lui duke it out in this fourstar blood bath dedicated to old japenese and slaughter films its a definite tarintino film and its hard not to recognize his determination to achieve a sickening result that will leave you numb and grossed out from what youve just witnessed but that doesnt go without saying that his talents almost supercede the acting abilities shown by thurman and lui both learned japenese to play the leading roles and both obviously went in for some training to be able to fight in certain scenes of the filmits far too bloody for anyone under seventeen and my recommendation is that you not eat before viewing its one of the most violent and bloody films although i have to admit there are some horror films which are a bit more disturbing and violent this left me feeling just a little bored seeing all the killing however i still loved it,cruel
all of this film is great there is nothing about volume 1 or volume 2 that i can pull down the best part is when she fights that young teenager it looks like shes down but she fights back i also like it at the end where she fights the boss she slices her head and its really good effects i also like it where she is fighting all of those men and all the blood on the floor is really cool it is just a really good film to enjoy and no one can really pull this down it is a true 1010 and i know the second one is just as good but this one is excellent i hope there can be more movies like that coming out in the future and more gory films which dont miss out any of the good bits which this film doesnt all together i think this film is one of the best i have watched in a long while,cruel
there is nothing better than being saved while drowning and that is what this film has done to the movie industry from direction to lighting fighting sequence and coloring this is simply amazing acting is dead on great timing writing is topnotch quality this was the diamond that made the dirt worth digging a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow of terrible films tarantino never ceases to amaze me the cast is excellent i can only love a film like this and hopefully more movies like this one will appear and less nick cannon movies will be made stop nick cannon and omarion and marques houston if you have the time,cruel
a quintessential tarantino campy slashfest full of gore and farcical violence but an absolute joy to watch i love campy slasher flicks i grew up on the dawn of the dead movies and a lot of kung fu stuff the brilliance of tarantino is he takes the best parts of all those offthewall films and puts them into superbly entertaining films vol 1 is one of thoseyouve got guns shot through boxes of kids cereal youve got unbelievable swordplay youve got graceful choreography youve got more profanity than you can shake a stick at this film has all that stuff and i loved practically every minute of it and what a departure for uma thurman 9 out of 10 its not a great classic film but its more than good enough to get a place of honor on your dvd shelfbarky,cruel
one of the most acclaimed movies this decade is volumes 1 and 2 both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the united states over 330 million dollars worldwide in total and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesnt have its own star in the hollywood walk of fame yet directed by the unique and creative quentin tarantino mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery excellent music and a wellrounded cast of zany characters sounds great doesnt it well vol 1 is a very good movie but it is not as good as people say it is as for volume 2 now that is a spectacular movie these two movies in actuality is one film but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long miramax decides to release it as two separate films despite the rather slow start finishes so strong you know why tarantino is as popular as he is todayis about a woman whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film known as the bride looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal killing every single person except for her but before she goes after the man that started the massacre she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first much easier said than done the first basically is like an action flick not concentrated too heavily on plot but more on action vol 2 does contain its amount of intense action but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just the bride but of the assassins and bill himselfthe first part of is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action the truth is there is only two massive action scenes and both are good dont get me wrong but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes they range from several scenes of chatter to an anime sequence to a long sequence of the bride trying to wiggle her toes talk about slowpaced to add to that it took 1020 minutes before the final fight was finally set up in other words she was at the scene of the major fight yet it took forever for the fight to begin this first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was robert rodriguez editing the filmtarantino also does this onetake shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene and this happens twice the movie is good there is a good storyline two jawdropping action scenes good cast of charactersi fell in love with gogo yubari and also the top assassin elle driver and a shocking twist in the end but overall i find vol 1 rather overrated if there is one thing i love about the first part though it has got to be the music especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place now enter part 2vol 2 is everything vol 1 wanted to be volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action humor excellent music brilliant acting and a very good ending volume 2 basically fills all the holes volume 1 created and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how the bride became so skillful volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal as the bride has to deal with budd elle and of course bill but gets a little more than what she bargained for elle driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around and daryl hannah wellknown as the mermaid in splash gives the best performance of the movie as she portrays the ruthless clever unpredictable and ragefilled rival assassin of the bride her battle against the bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 yearsthe second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing this was the pure filming brilliance that i was expecting from tarantino very few flaws in the movie and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original but it did not feel that way there is not much more to say about the second part except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade overall is a great film overrated but a superb film nonetheless not the best i have seen this decade but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years packs a violent punch a truly entertaining roller coastervol 1  710 vol 2  1010 overall  810,cruel
now this is a movie only qt couldve done something this great the dialouge the violence the drama the action every aspect of this movie rocks kicking off with a harrowing introduction that is sure to haunt you in your sleep vol 1 pretty much makes you want to be on the brides side doing some killing while this one doesnt fixate itself much on the story or the background history of what happened to the bride the movie doesnt really need to rather it straps you down for a roller coaster ride of pure action the material arts is top notch especially at the big show down at the end the comedic parts are actually funny the animated history of oniwan is dazzling sure they overdo it on the blood but so what half of the stuff they do in here cant be done in real life anyway so just sit back enjoy and turn your bullshit alarms off this is the first installment of a movie that is going to dazzle you see it now,cruel
those who wish to slay tarantinos have certainly not seen beneath the film layer there is a passionate mind behind this film and by combining the amount of different cultures into one film he has produced something which will be watched in decades to come those who have negative comments about this film stand upspeak your opinions but have you ever tried to direct and produce a film before one which strays out of usual categories his use of different cultures and different genres make for an exciting and enjoyable watch as it does stray out of the norm and allows people to experience something new as did pulp fiction i believe that tarantino is one of the most influential and exciting directors that have appeared and i enjoy watching his future films as well as his past,cruel
uma thurman is here telling the story of a blood soaked bride and how she wants revenge on one man who did this to her and his name is bill david carrdine the story follows ms thurman as the bride and how she will stop at nothing to get revenge on him not caring who she kills on the way will she have the guts to take out the deadly assassin squad who had thought they killed her on her wedding day 4 years earlier but what they dont know is that she is still alive and the only thing she wants is their lives for what they did to her uma thurman blew me away with her performance as the blood spalttered bride and i was actually quite moved because i could understand her pain of losing a child and that everyone you loved was dead uma has a big range of emotions and she can go from killing the crazy 88 to being upset about losing her daughter over some heartless assassins i was also very surprised by lucy liu as oren ishii because i saw her in charlies angels and i wasnt that impressed because the acting wasnt that great anyway i think that she is a very sexy asian and she brings some spice to the role which makes her great all the acting was amazing and i think that quentin taratino is a genius for making this excellent film i recommend this to fans of pulp fiction or any other uma or quentin film,cruel
in the past ive refused to rate a film as my favorite but i have now come to realise that this great work is about as entertaining as it getsvol1 is quentins most accomplished film by miles perfectly melding together thousands of references from past masterpieces to create a postmodern epic worthy of great praiseafter about literally at least ten viewings it still amazes me how visually stunning it is seemingly never relenting from its attack on the senses great soundtrack great visualsgreat pace its almost like a generation x sergio leone film if blood doesnt scare you please watch this as it wont disappoint,cruel
when a woman was left for dead for four years and six months ago she wakes up from a coma she finds out that her about to be husband and her unborn child is dead now awake and paralyzed she goes for a bloody revenge on the people who tried to kill her now the woman with no name decides to make a list of 5 people to kill lucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah micheal madsen and david carradine as bill there are a few continuity errors but please dont take it so serious and enjoy the film there is also a lot of gore and blood so keep children away from the big screen it is worth taking a look at uma thurman and david carradine,cruel
just when you thought it was safe to go back into the cinema the master of decadent violence is back quentin tarantino returns after a sixyear lull with his homage to kung fu revenge flicks from the 1970sthe plot not too taxing for those of you who were left reeling by the nonchronological approach of his previous three filmsuma thurman looking gorgeous in tight fitting outfits throughout plays well im not really sure who she plays for some inexplicable reason whenever she is referred to by name theres a high pitched beep on the soundtrack anyway i digress ms thurman is credited as being the bride probably because the movie opens with her assassination on her wedding day shes left for dead after being viciously attacked kicked beaten and shot several times by a team of 5 deadly well nearly assassins lead by bill she survives and after regaining consciousness from a 4 year coma embarks on a mission of revenge against the 4 team members and of course its leader bill get it well come on kill 4 assassins and then bill is a bit of a longwinded title isnt it so is the muchhyped 4th movie by quentin tarantino any good the straight answer is i dont knowlet me put it this way take richard burton not a bad actor but had an outstanding voice my old grandmother used to say that if they ever released a record of mr burton reading from the telephone book shed be the first in line to buy it well i was one of the first in line to see and i saw the movie equivalent of the greater london residential directory a to dis a stylish treat for the eyes black and white animation and a visually stunning blast of colour during a night drive through tokyo all used to great effect but the movie is empty we care about the brides motivation and need for revenge she lost everything at the hands of these 5 people her unborn child 4 years of her life and presumably the groom but the way she goes about it is hollow and unengagingthe nonlinear style to storytelling that worked so well for him in his other films lets him down here the climatic showdown between uma and lucy lu is rendered dull and unsuspenseful with the revelation in the first halfhour of the film that lus character has been killed some parts of the fight scenes were excellently choreographed others werent some of the humour was used to great effect some of it wasnt but lacking most of all was the razor sharp tarantino dialogue that slices through each of his previous movies there were glimmers of it there but it was vastly over shone by the glimmers of light of sword bladesyou really do get the feeling that this film mightve worked better had tarantino stuck to his original plan of a 90minute revenge flick but instead hes been talked into splitting the flick into two volumes doubling its original intended length sure everything might make greater sense once vol 2 is released but i resent having to pay twice to see what was always designed as a single filmthis is by far mr tarantinos most violent movie the violence is comic book like in parts and gritty and unnerving in others tarantino fans wont be disappointed so long as they dont expect too much this film will disappoint if youre expecting the next pulp fiction but with added kung fuif you dont like blood and gallons of it squirting from severed limbs and heads this movie is not for you save your money and go and rent quentin tarantinos first two movies on dvd youll have a great night,cruel
the brideuma thurman was shot down along with the rest of her wedding guests on her wedding day she was shot in the head by a man named billdavid carradine the first problem was that survived from the coma the second problem was that she was one of the worlds top assassins now she is mad and wants revenge on everyone that betrayed herlucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah michael madsen leaving bill for lastthe movie is quentin tarantinos 4th movie and is the first of two parts the movie was so great that it is second to only one of his movies pulp fiction the fighting scenes are the best fight scenes since the matrix if not better and the writing is amazing the music is awesome the acting is great and did i say the fight scenes honestly this is the most entertaining movie i have ever scene overall the movie is flawless one of my top ten greatest of all timei highly recommend this movie,cruel
i was not a tarantino fan until i saw this movie yes it is still a tarantino film but he has gained style his use of black and white is excellent and he seems to draw 100 out of every actorif you are like i was not a fan of pulp fiction  do not be put off this film is well worth watching my no1 film is shawshank redemption and although they are very different films i put them 1st equal now as i would happily watch both films over and over because knowing the ending does not spoil the enjoyment of watching it take its coursethis is not to be missed  excellent,cruel
either youll love him or youll hate him has everybody told me about quentin tarantino no other alternatives his style is an extreme unrealistic grotesque one and you cant help but adoring it or hating it in my circle of friends actually there are much more people feeling the first way well i have to say that i disagree my feelings were actually disappointment some boredom and a touch of admiration for some aspects of this overdiscussed movie aspects that i will point out later let me tell first what i found disappointingafter having watched pulp fiction i kept wondering about what people was so enthusiast about in that mess of violence if it wasnt for one thing that the gore was coupled with a witty script that as regards dialog was reached by very few films i ever saw in my entire life as a lover of words i found a lot to enjoy on this side but what about at least about volume one we are talking about here if you take a look at the memorable quotes section here on imdb there is the totality of the dialog in the film the strength of the movie doesnt lie in the use of words but there is violence so much that in half an hour you find yourself laughing out loud at the screen as heads and limbs are cut off leaving only rivers of cartoonish blood coming out from everywhere well as i was laughing i told myself  is this really a healthy thing is it good that so much people enjoy that much watching a hour and a half of tomato juice  because the directors style wants to remind us every single moment that this is what were dealing with tomato juice is it good that a supposed masterpiece is made up of a pregnant woman beaten up to a neardeath then shot then raped throughout her 4yearslong coma a mother killed in front of her daughter a preteen girl seducing the pedophile killer of her family and having her revenge in bed with him and so many so many so many limbs cut off i dont think that this is a healthy thing and this is why im angry every time that i find a tarantinophile telling me that there is no greatest director in the world because all these people will watch the movie with their 6yearold children and think oh no my god theres no problem even a kid could easily tell that this is fake and so what is the positive point then we can turn around this as much as we want but in the end what we have here is a nonexisting story filled with pointlessly overacted acts of violence from the beginning to the end and we find excitement and pleasure in watching them because they are wellpresented skilfully told and nicely directed with every right camera angle you need im not sure that this is enough to make a masterpiece i promised that i would later have pointed out what the interesting elements of the film are in my opinion of course there are some the last thing you can say about tarantino is that he suffers from lack of originality and this originality lies precisely in his ability of putting the puzzle together adding to the mix of citations and past cinematic references the quality of vision he undoubtedly owes at the highest level  and that you cant help but admire whether you approve him or not for example and this is to be found not only in but in all his production hes the man of the soundtracks you can sense it since the opening sequence when youre hit by the voice of nancy sinatra with bang bang my baby shot me down  in this movie he makes perhaps his best soundtrack achievement to date the best evidence of it is that it is totally unsuitable to be turned into a cd compilation and in this form it is very hard to listen to but if married to the images it perfectly suits every movement every glance every breath music provides also the only few moments of pause in the entire movie like the simply adorable lonely shepherd by zamfir which accompanies the alreadyclassical words by michael madsen that woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die brief but wonderful musical gems are to be found throughout the film and add a lot to the visual experienceanother good thing is what i couldnt describe in any other way than a touch of magic that you can feel here and there in some moments of the movie despite all the gore and all the violence the moment in which the bride after the furious and ohmygodhowlong fight with the crazy 88 goes to the final battle with oren is one of them the scene changes abruptly and all the blood is cancelled by the snow in a white japanese garden surrounded by a dark blue sky for a brief moment you experience peace and this sensation is without a doubt provided by the directors talent and this is not the only noteworthy moment  even in the overlong fighting scenes which i am not a fan of there is something more than an immediate level to findthe man definitely has a thing for imagination and he knows he has he also knows how to let the public be part of his imagination i can only warn this public that he also knows  more than any other director ive watched in my life  how to manipulate the audience when you watch a tarantino film in primis admire his talent but try to be aware of this,cruel
i used to adore this film if you would have asked me sixmonths ago i would have given this movie a 10 then i got educated after watching films by akira kurosawa the lines in this movie became almost laughable i can picture quentin pounding his fists on the coffeetable screaming i wanna make a samurai movie kurosawas films had a certain nobility to them which is sadly something that quentin has yet to master i think the problem was that he tried to hard to replicate the cool feeling of pulp fiction the redeeming thing about this movie is that it almost feels original only in a few spots did i roll my eyes at his corny dialog lucky for me i hadnt seen the stinking pile of garbage that became known as volume 2 yet,cruel
this movie in certain sense is cool excellent fight scenes that the rrating grants him the topic in general the only thing that i find ridiculous it is that they are too exaggerated when the bride cuts him the arm head or other parts from the body to its opponents they are so fictitious that they bother in the version dvd you can appreciate all the combat scenes better especially that of tokyo a tip that i read in a magazine that the version of kill japanese bill region 3 the this scene of tokyo lasts more and heshe comes to color while we have to see it in bw david carradine after kungugh it continued making and playing very good movies like these today 12 june 2005 it will be used for the first time in tv for latin america for hbo who have not seen it syntonize it i am already making propaganda that such and good i add that 2 are better than the first one,cruel
one thing in that confused me is why was the movie out of order this is a stupid question to ask since i did watch the making of on my dvd and i think quenton did say why i dont remember though also what did oren mean when she said boss tanaka of what perversion do you speak what does that mean anyone here know i dont know what to say this thing says we need 10 lines im not good at writing unless it is on a topic i have something to say aboutanyone have yahoo messenger d if you do send me a message my screen name is jasonrocker12 ill just write some quotes from movies napolean tina you fat lard come get some ham madison enjoy heaven natalie go to hell leader of the knights who say ni ni  how do you know so much about swallows cindysits on chair and it makes a farting noise it was the chair the oraclesits on the other chair and makes a loud farting noise yes the chair,cruel
how do you review a film thats a montage of so many others you can look at tarantinos works one of two ways either as a maverick genius recycling popular culture into exciting new forms or as a talent less hack ripping off the real masters of the form i tend to be in agreement with the first yes consistently references and in some cases downright steals from other movies but it is melded into something fresh and exciting who can fail to be exhilarated by the showdown at the house of blue leaves or raise a laugh at the dead pan humour the other question mark is this a complete film or simply half of one i would tend to view them as separate films with their own unique styles and feels with vol 2 drawing more on leone westerns than vol 1s shaw brothers etctaranatinos visual and narrative tricks are brought to the fore long tracking shots some strange pov shots through a bullet exit wound the usual car trunk shot etc although the fetishistic shot of uma thurmans feet i could maybe have done without the story is told in the nonlinear segmented form that tarantino has made an art of since reservoir dogs the soundtrack is reminiscent of the variety of pulp fiction he recognise sound as such an important part of the medium the brides entrance to tokyo is met by a theme that will surely now be remembered only for rather than its original tv series and is as an inspired choice as his choosing of the delphonics for jackie brown and dick dale for pulp fictionthere are some drawbacks though there is very little of the razor sharp dialogue in this first instalment which before has always been a highlight of his films ie the banter between jules and vincent in pulp fiction or the madonna discussion from dogs nothing here matches that but theres a reason for as this is a roaring rampage of revenge and in that it succeeds on every level 810,cruel
quentin tarantino has always claimed to love japanese films and watching his prior works reflects this only now has he completely taken the genre he loves and given it the hollywood treatment and it really works the japanese cartoon sequence in particular showing the history of oren was beautifully done and a lovely tribute to the culture that tarantino owes the influence for the film throughout the films are various other acknowledgements and references to the japanese film industryuma thurman whom i never really have liked much completely won me over with her performance as the bride she was all too aware that she had been cast as the superhero and relished in it and clearly had fun living up to all stereotypesthe fight choreography in this film was amazing totally convincing and thrilling to watch the scene in which the bride takes out the entire crazy 88 is breathtaking the choreographer must have spent ages working that out and the final product is worth the price of admission in itselfsomeone who caught my eye in this film was chiaki kuriyama she was amazing as orens bodyguard gogo yubari for someone who was handed a ball and chain and told to master it in just three months she looked completely at ease with it and used it with great confidence i hope to see more of her in hollywoodi have to mention the use of blood in this film too the way it sprays out instead of trickling is pure tarantino at his best,cruel
i feel schizophrenic about this movie on the one hand i thought it was well directed cinematic ally clever and beautiful i thought uma thurman was terrific along with the rest of the cast i saw both i  ii back to back which is probably the best way to see them i kept looking for a reason for the madness and i came to the conclusion that the madness exists purely as a clinical and stylized exercise it reminds me a little of surgery however in surgery there is at least a purpose or hoped for outcometo save the patient this movie is obviously not interested in the patient only in the clinical exerciseby the time we are supposed to care it is way too late this movie is a pop intellectual experience not unlike a video game it has all the right moves music camera angles profanityetc once the game is over no one caresthe package is glittery and seductive but empty i give it six stars for style and acting,cruel
vol 1 is so cool it hurts really its so cool the coolness gets in the way of it being a good film instead we get an empty stylistic spectacle with cardboard caricatures lame segues and a weird snuffporn schematic how on earth quentin tarantino went from this to the solid cinematic achievement that is vol 2 is beyond mea bride is left for dead in a texas church with eight or nine other victims after a visit from her former comrades in the deadly viper assassination squad after a fouryear coma she suddenly recovers and sets about getting her bloody revengeits cool the film opens with the shaw brothers logo telling us this is a homage to the chopsocky films tarantino grew up with its cool tarantino manages to stick in so many obvious homages to directors legendary and otherwise but copious epigramming dont make for high achievement in film any more than in literature and after a while the exercise becomes more obvious and annoying theres no glue here just a lot of winks and nods in scattered directionsuma thurman does a serviceable job as the bride but she presents nothing close to the nuanced sensitive character we see in vol 2 she just runs around in a bruce lee jumpsuit killing people david carradine who gives vol 2s best performance is mostly mia and quite a different personality in his little voiceover bits here the villains seem to do things for effect rather than reason one assassin allows her minions to get creamed by a single attacker without jumping in to lend a hand perhaps thinking about the pension savings but hardly helping herself down the road when she must fight her attacker all by herself another sequence has an assassin being called up at the last possible minute to cancel a murder because he feels he owes it to the comatose victim not to be a rat about it though that didnt stop him before from shooting her while she lay defenseless on the floor beautiful people merrily subject themselves to dismemberment disembowelment and assorted mayhem because its coolafter a while it all just feels like a massive puton something to go with the cool music and cool costumes and everything else even the dialogue which usually shines in tarantino films seems perfunctory everything is subsumed by imagethere are some good moments sonny chiba delivers a funny and poignant performance as a retired katana maker of great repute from whom the bride seeks help in a rare sequence not belabored with blood or film references theres some laughs amid the violence that show tarantino hasnt lost his gift for balancing action suspense and comedybut the fights go on too long and feel pointless can anyone look at the brides battle with the crazy 88 after watching crouching tiger hidden dragon worked on by the same fight coordinator and not see how hokey the former looks by comparison the anime sequence is also overlong and bloody not to mention selfindulgentmaybe it was intentional on the filmmakers part to have such a comicbook introduction with broad strokes galore and leave the human dimension for vol 2 if so it certainly works vol 2 is a terrific film perhaps more but vol 1 is so cool it left me frozen,cruel
i would consider myself as a great tarantino fan reservoir dogs and pulp fiction are masterpieces in my eyes and i even liked jacky brown so i was really looking forward to watch the new tarantino i wanted to read all informations and news about this almost two years before it actually started after this long waiting time i was disappointed when i watched it i missed this special humour of tarantino which made me laugh so many times in res dogs and pf this movies have been violent and funny at the same time wasnt funny for me it was a good action movie even a great movie for a fan of martial arts  but if you liked tarantinos style in his earlier movies you might be a little bit disappointed 610,cruel
one has to constantly wonder what would happen were quentin tarantino put in a prison cell with mark brandon read for a day or two given that the latter really has had his ears cut off and knows what happens during such impromptu surgery i think the conversation alone would be rather interesting to say the leastbut this is a digression tarantino at least had the honesty to come out and say that this opus was a work of pure fantasy this however does not save it from falling prey to tarantinos trendiness one has to hand it to him for being able to make something seem hip in an era where nobody seems to know what is cool anymore nonetheless revels in its own supposed hipness to such an extent that in twenty years time it will no doubt be viewed with the same kind of contempt reserved for the likes of the brady bunch rather than the admiration films like robocop get as they near the age of twenty yearsspeaking of that august piece of true ultraviolence quentin tarantino only serves to prove in this effort that in spite of all his pretensions he is no paul verhoeven in spite of his efforts to pull the same literal crucifixion of his hero no emotional connection to the bride is ever offered the bride is simply a loud bitch who kills people in front of their families or sadistically chops them apart no good reason is given to want to see the bad guys dead and thus the emotional impact of their death is nonexistentto its credit part one is very entertaining when one doesnt know what is going to happen next the weird kung fustyle mentoring scenes with the swordsmith and the hospital scenes certainly stand out the problem is that once you know what is going to happen it just gets incredibly dull the house of blue leaves is probably one of the worst examples of music in a film ive seen outside of a blaxploitation effort i would have given real money for that band to shut the hell up obviously tarantino was never told about what an impact the right music in a given scene can have upon the dynamics of a sceneuma thurman was also a poor choice for the heroine someone like lucy liu i could believe doing all these things but uma comes off as being too homely and sedate not to mention that she looks like shes from another planet although that might have been an intentional aspect of her casting in the end i wanted to see julie dreyfus in actioni gave vol 1 a five out of ten it is excellent proof of that old saying about first impressions being the best impressions it is worth renting once and once only,cruel
dont get me wrong but i didnt like this movie that much ive seen all other tarantino films all of them seem better to me much better pulp fiction was clever funny enjoyable at least reservoir dogs was entertaining and relatively well executed but here we got a movie with no plot no twists no dialogue the action is not that good takes too long to get into it to realize that hey there is nothing else here besides violence what looks great in anime myself being an anime fan translated poorly into the animated part is pretty good but thats it everything else just looks so out of place the blood the fighting style the inaccurate japanese elements want to see anime then watch animebut well maybe its just me,cruel
volume 1 is all blood and no content there are flashes of good filmmaking cinematography music and editing are all commendable but simply not enough story and too many plot holesi think praise should be given to uma thurman who pitches an excellent balance of emotions and showing that she is killing for a reason but all the other characters are too sketchy the director is too besotted with her to put any actual detail to everybody elseif you are a fan of tarantino then you should enjoy this film but i felt that my time was wasted if you are looking for a good martial arts film then i recommend zatochi 510,cruel
it is really disappointing to see this wannabe mishmash is getting such high vote average i just hope it is due to the votes of the stunned adolescence crowd or actual teenagers then it is understandable since they just do not know any betterthis film is one wretched attempt at being hip and cool and showing off nothing more in every scene one can just see tarantino pulling off his scanty hair trying to figure out how to titilate the juvenile how to top the nonsensical with the ridiculous there are big holes in the plotline that just seem to make no difference as long as blood is squirting just high enoughthe thing has weak plot flat characters mostly awkward score and is rampantly incoherent in stylethe mix of rippedoff films is just so transparent at the hemline that the storyline wiggles in despair and there never really emerges a film as a whole only separate scenes of bad dialogue and bad actingi wish someone in hollywood  slapped some humility and that loudmouth tarantino i wish he just stopped making this bul arghhhhi cannot stand him,cruel
alright i just got back from seeing the latest tarantino offering from the very first frame of the film i knew i was in for a treat the opening production credits sent me back in time to when my mom and dad would take me to see kung fu bmovies dusty dirty film footage accompanied by a scratchy wonkey soundtrack a la godzilla then the first 10 minutes of the movie had me wondering if i would be walking out because it is going to be too graphic but it was nothing like reservoir dogs where i almost did do so this movie was stylish sexy funny and sad all at the same time the fight scenes were remarkable especially one that takes place between uma and a sexy little japanese schoolgirl though there were a lot of limbs and heads lopped off tarantino made it gory but ridiculously funny at the same time this movie is definitely one of the best ive seen this year obviously not for everyone a few people walked out this film is best not taken too seriously if you are a fan of old chinese kung fu movies and have some knowledge of japanese animation and the like you will love all the subtle intricacies in this film in short this is one hell of a movie that is not to be missed,cruel
oh quentin what have you done money probably was a huge disappointment so shallow only meaningless violence and well done technical tricks no inner wisdom or sensitivity nothing just because reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were so great movies i have to give a chance and watch the part two i must ask a question why do bad movies again from dusk till dawn already were awful slamming vol 1 is not a bit betterall you who praise see the opening of reservoir dogs or the development of samuelljacksons character in pulp fiction actually every character there they are jewels of movie history is waste of time deftly done but boring,cruel
this film is awfuli was so bored whist watching it i nearly slipped into a coma luckily for me i was able to think of something completely different whilst the film was dragging oni left the cinema seething at what a waste of money this dreadful film was and with the thought that no matter how much fight training uma thurman ever did she would be no match for a gang of japanese criminalsthey would pulverize her0110regards ian,cruel
my rating  out of  as i said in my first review of volume 1 i would write a second review after i saw volume 2 when i reviewed it i said that i really enjoyed it yet i had a few complaints about how tarantino wanted to rip me off and that this was an incomplete film i said that volume 2 would have to fill in the holes for me to change my rating well volume 2 filled in the holes and it did brilliantly however after seeing volume 2 in the theater i had the urge to buy volume 1 on dvd so i did and i finally watched it tonight i must say after seeing volume 2 it strengthens volume 1 in an astonishing way nevertheless i would still like to see the films edited into a whole volume 1 is an exhilarating masterpiece on its own and volume 2 brilliantly fills in the backstory while adding an emotional resonance to the story but together they might make a masterpiece to challenge tarantinos top two films reservoir dogs and pulp fiction there is an advantage to cutting into two films which has to do with the different tones of the films however i think could really shine as one film we shall see when tarantino decides to release the dvd some people complain that doesnt have the great dialogue that was in tarantinos reservoir dogs pulp fiction and to some extent jackie brown well it is true that this is not the brilliant snappy dialogue that tarantino penned in his other films but the dialogue here works its not the dialogue i delight in hearing in dogs and pulp but it fits here i do not feel it is a flaw like some other reviewers have thought i think its an asset on the dvd it is said that tarantino and uma thurman came up with the idea for on the set of pulp fiction well you can definitely see that here volume 1 is their movie maybe another reason for the split more people get involved in volume 2 david carradine daryl hannah for example but this is tarantinos and thurmans movie here you clearly see that in the movie uma thurman dominates the screen like never before she carries as much screen presence as any action star and shes got more than enough acting talent required for the role other actors in the film such as lucy liu sonny chiba have supporting roles from an acting standpoint this is thurmans movie and she makes that perfectly clear her performance in volume 2 was the more accomplished one but she is terrific here thurman developed the bride into more of a person in volume 2 here she is more of an icon however that being said i thought thurman added some humanity to the role in volume 1 she is a woman bent on revenge but i did sense the bride was a real person the rest of the cast offers their support lucy liu is effective as oren sonny chiba should be given credit he makes hattori hanzo into a memorable character for not much screentime vivica fox does a good job in her limited screentime daryl hannah makes a brief appearance and makes an impression michael madsen and david carradine show up in volume 2this is also clearly tarantinos film volume 1 is packed with style tarantinos stylistic techniques here are all creative and dont seem excessive the slomo scene of oren and her crew walking toward us is memorable the split screen technique is used perfectly in one scene a homage to brian de palma the most unique technique tarantino uses is an anime sequence to tell the backstory of oren the sequence is incredibly violent and beautiful in a deadly way from a stylistic point of view volume 1 maybe tarantinos most memorable film although volume 2 is certainly a contender however its the action scenes that prove that as a director tarantino is in peak form the smaller battle between the bride and vernita is handled well but the showdown at the the house of leaves is a tour de force its just an exhilarating fight scene that bests any fight scene i have seen in years in fact the only fight sequence i have seen recently that comes close was the fight between the bride and elle driver in volume 2the fight sequence between the bride and oren really deserves mention it was a beautifully photographed and expertly handled scene it was the most beautiful moment in any tarantino film i read a review of tarantinos jackie brown that said tarantino was not a great visuals director well i bet they would change their mind after watching that scene i also credit cinematographer robert richardson for making that scene look as great as it did how he did not receive an oscar nomination for cinematography i will never know in the end volume 1 is just an exhilarating film that is technically brilliant in every area it does not have much depth more of that comes in volume 2 but its the kind of film that does not need to be incredibly deep its the directors work that is masterful here and the leading actress deserves a tremendous amount of credit too with volume 1 q and u have given us a masterpiece and it is sure to be come a classic,cruel
id like to keep this shortso ill jump straight to the meat the term originality so often used in any review of tarantinos work should never be applied to this movie there is nothing new herebut such is tarantinos excellence that even this hackneyed material seems new the revenges story is as old as greek tragedymaybe even older he even throws in the old clichd motherchild motif lets face it revenge drama even with female protagonists is nothing new at all worse lets just face it its a bad plotbecause we know the outcome the protagonist might suffer might get beat up might even fall into a coma for 4 years but eventually they will winthis is never in any doubt perhaps this total predictability is why i dont much like this type of filmthe use of continuity in this film was as usual confusing and jumping through time the first big fight killing vernita green comes after the climactic death of oren at the end of the film hate to tell you quentinbrilliant in pulp fiction boring here it was new once just once is all you getwhere this film shines is the usual strengthsquentins use of miseenscene character and of course music only quentin tarantino can take a scene of oren and henchfolk entering a bar and make it as heartstoppingly cool as the scene is in this film this is brilliant moviemakingi wish the rest of the film lived up to that level unfortunately the creativity stops therein endless homages to all the different fave movies of tarantino spaghetti western hongkong grind animeall here unfortunately i feel that the uses of all these other stylesultimately leads to no real style of his owni realize that quentin tarantino did not intend this film to be originalit is rather an affectionate nod to styles that have influenced his own style unfortunately id rather watch adaptation and see something completely new perhaps when he finds his own unique style again ill return to his fold i can only give this movie 7 out of 10ps to quentingood job at cannes,cruel
this is a meandering and tawdry film that keeps you wondering why you are watching it at all  the director had some good films previouslynaturally that is the reason faith  but the strengths of his other films are absent here there are no colourful characters most are downright implausible no quirky dialogue almost no dialogue actually there is some action but no suspense it is like watching a video game played very well from over someones shoulder  i dont know if the few semiserious scenes are meant to be sincere because they reek of falsity and dreadful clich  poor sonny chiba he looks like hes doing a pepsi commercial  there is a great amount of gore and in fact almost every scene has a particularly nasty element to it this is much more in the vein of natural born killers than pulp fiction  but story where is the story what story there is is terribly full impossibilities too many to list after a while you just have to guess that it is a kind of dream that doesnt adhere to any reality except the directors indulgence  thats rarely a good timedid it really take him nearly a decade to make this  if so quentin really should learn to make better use of his time  much of this film could have been shot in a weekend with all the contrived title cards and video effects wrapped up in a month  much has been made about choreographed fight scenes but later i read the script was discarded and much of it was done freeform  this seems very likely as most of the fighters just look like stunt men standing around waiting to fall when uma taps them  theres just no skill here no discernable authentic martial arts being done overall an insipid and unsatisfying film,cruel
i was quite excited to see tarantinos 4th movie i love his previous work but this movie really sucks big time heres whyi guess the script can fit in one or two sheets of paper cause besides from the fight scenes theres nothing left but a bride trying to have a revange for her murdered wedding day husband and son so thats not enough to make a decent story not a 90 minutes onefight fight fight blood blood blood swords swords swords big deal millions of japanese and chinese filmakers have been doing that since who knows when but even when first bruce lees movies sucked it was really stunning to see him move and fight that was the magic but why did i payed to see this blonde chick fly with cables attached to her waist fighting against 88 katos at once this movie just dont make any scencenow the good part here is why its not the worst movie i ve seen a very small portion of that darkhumor tarantinos got its always appreciated the actresses are really gorgeous the photography is quite nice with all those bright colors and contrasted combinations it has some interesting colorfull scenes and camera movements very creative but a movies not made out of that and the music is greatthe only part thats amazing n great is the anime scenes those are really greatbut more amazing than the disappointment of this nonsense bloody stupid movie was to see the ratings it got in this website whats wrong with you people will you applause to everything the media tell you to applause or is it just me who didnt get something maybe its not that tarantinos trying to make a fool out of us maybe the whole movie was actually a dark joke and its just me who didnt get it,cruel
terrible movie i walked out after the first 20 minutes it was tortuous to sit through dont waste your money or time it was just rambling fight scenes strung together with lots of gross violent images i just dont get it how they call call crap like this a movie,cruel
so anyway i went in2 the cinema frankly expecting to be let down by a director who had nothing else to say  hence his exile since 94 im not counting the woeful jackie brown since i cant stand elmore leonard anyway so nobody couldve made a good job of his material imo however days later im thinking obsessively about this movie in a way i havent experienced since pulp fiction so i guess it blew me away  but with some pretty big buts thrown in there too so ill get those out of the way first and lest i rant and rave overly long keep in mind that i basically thought that this film was awesomefirst the whole onelongmoviecutintotwo thing in this respect i agree with most of the critics who didnt like the movie james berardinelli bemoans it as half a movie that goes on too long and hes bang on from what i can gather qt wanted to make an unashamed grindhouse movie so the simplistic plot stylised action sequences and campy grue can all be fully justified yet im positive that some sterner editing couldve squeezed the entire thing into one threehour long movie that wouldve been much closer to qts vision in particular the sonny chiba scenes couldve been cut down to maybe a fifth or sixth of what they were and it seems im in a minority here everyone else appears to be hailing chibas scenes as the best in the movie basically the plot for these sequences is the bride goes to japan to get a kitana sword from a master craftsman now its okay for these scenes to play out for a while if what i just described is no more than a basic synopsis of what is actually a much richer tapestry you know girl goes to get sword but then this happens then that happens and so she now has to do this this and that just to get back to the sword etc etc but there is no more depth to it and rightly so in a film of this nature the bride goes to japan to get a kitana sword from a master craftsman is not a basic synopsis of that segment of the film its all that happens yet it goes on and on and on and on why i suspect because of qts naked adoration of sonny chiba the first scene from these sequences is apparantly a comic relief moment with the bride pretending to be no more than an innocent tourist chiba and his partner arguing at length in japanese about who gets to cut the sushi and who gets to make the tea yet given that a the bride makes her true intentions clear before this scene has ended thus making her disguise utterly redundant and b the comedic exchanges between chiba and his buddy were about as humourous as being run over this entire scene was a waste of time it felt like one of those deleted scenes that you see on dvds all the time another scene that couldve easily been cut at least by half and probably by considerably more was that whole anime sequence now it could be cos im just not a fan of anime but i doubt it since i also understand that that sequence wouldnt have gotten past the censors if shot live and its an interesting enough backstory but still for my money it was way too long there are also a few other smaller scenes that couldve done with some more prudent snipping  the bride crying and crying and crying and crying upon waking from her coma and realising her baby was gone yes very traumatic and im sure worth every second were this a realtime project but it isnt and we get it already move on and the whole wiggle your big toe bit snore the more worrying problem with this precedent for turning one film into two in order to protect the integrity of the directors original vision so miramaxs blurb goes is that now every1 will do it and well all forever be paying 13 to watch rough cuts of movies that couldve been much tighter and half the price if the integrity of tarantinos vision is all that mattered to miramax  why didnt they give free tickets to volume 2 away with every ticket sold for volume 1 and compensate the cinemas out of their own pockets hmmsecond and last actually  remember despite my ranting i actually love this film  the subtitling now i have no problem watching a foreign film im not bothered that half the movie is in japanese with subtitles in fact for the purposes of authenticity i hate any other option but subtitling you know like in hunt for red october where all the russians talk to each other in english but with russian accents dreadful shameful however in this movie half the subtitling is entirely unnecessary consider for instance the sonny chiba sequences midmovie chibas character establishes early on that he speaks fluent english yet as soon as the bride reveals the true nature of her visit they speak from that moment on in japanese why i suppose that one could argue that since its also established that the bride speaks fluent japanese that its just as likely that theyd speak japanese as english although id have believed more in a han solochewbaccastyle dialogue in which each person speaks in their own tongue but consider also that this is a westernmade movie which will make most of its money from englishspeaking audiences and it wouldve been perfectly acceptable for these scenes to be spoken in english worse still are the exchanges between the bride and oren ishii both protagonists are apparently american so why are they speaking to each other in japanese personally id have been perfectly happy  given that qt was trying to replicate about a billion chopsocky bmovies  if hed replaced all the foreign dialogue with some deliberately bad dubbing though i admit thats not so much a criticism as a personal thing that wouldve been okay by meall that said i thought the rest of the movie was a blast exceeding my expectations all over the place the blood is not overthetop and it is deliberately unrealistic in order to fit into the genre of films that qt is paying homage to ditto the sometimesjarring quite often tooloud soundtrack the eye closeups the pauses to introduce each principal badguy deadly viper assassination squad member vernita green aka copperhead or the obligatory japanese schoolgirl go go yubari some reviewer who just didnt get it was wondering what perverted mind thought that character up personally i cant think of any piece of modern asian popculture that doesnt include a schoolgirl and anyway isnt she just the best thing in the film god i thought that waiting for matrix revolutions or more pertinantly star wars episode 3 was bad enough im finding myself having to fight the urge to have a churlish hissyfit of footstamping and pouting at the thought of having to wait til february for volume 2oh and id forgotten how quickly you can fall in love with uma thurman if you allow yourself to get lost in her eyes thanks quentin now im dissatisfied with my lot in life all over again,cruel

whoa  was that one different  a spaghetti westernjapanese actionanime flick  although artful and unusual the gratuitous violence was a bit much blood squirting 30 feet in the air  do these characters really have blood pressure of 100009000 or somethingnonlinear story line just like pulp fiction but not as much story  plot was simplistic much less convoluted than pulp i liked pf better uma kinda fits her part but doesnt look athletic enough to be the warrior she potrays  bill is like charlie in charlies angels  heard but not seen lucy liu was an awesome cast job cool cinematography  the weird interpersonal shorts are a tarantino staple  will i pay to see bill2 maybe wait for dvd  710,cruel
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  i have never felt the emotion of suspense while histerically laughing at the same time  spoiler alertall right the house of blue leaves chapter i could not stop laughing when blood would spray all over the place  that is some of the funniest stuff i have ever seen at the same time i was captivated by black mamba and her struggle cause i could not tell what was going to happen  i had some idea because of the foreshadowing tarantino used but my god it was awesome how he will throw the curve ball at youthe camp of this film is what makes it great  it is just so entertaining however this is not a film id take my mother to see  it is very adultthis film has boosted itself onto my top ten list just because of how well it was done  if you like tarantinos style and quirkiness see this film and expect that and more sit back and enjoy have a good time and i recommend seeing it with friends and not treating this film as reality  this is what the movie experience is about,cruel
quentin tarantino has made an amazing movie with and for me has surpassed the likes of his earlier masterpieces pulp fiction and reservoir dogs  i cant give this film high enough praise for its wonderful homage to violence and the kung fu genre  each scene has its own personality and every slash of the sword made my smile bigger  it was almost like watching a live action anime movie it was that incredible  uma thurman is great and i was never really a huge fan before this  jeezmovie experiences just dont get too much better  there was enough style in this movie to feed a continent  i cant wait for 2 because things are gonna go down that i do not want to miss  i used to be skeptical to the lady hero but after seeing this film im a different man  oscars all around  why not  this movie was just too good to be true for a fan of action films or martial art flicks  unbelievable plain and simpleten out of tenbig time,cruel
revenge is a dish best served coldquentin tarantinos fourth film and the first one since 1997s jackie brown takes the theme of revenge like hamlet on steroids it has not been an easy road for this generations it director tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for reservoir dogs that he later directed it was his directorial effort in 1994s pulp fiction that catapulted tarantino as well as the independent film company miramax into the hollywood mainstream unfortunately his next film jackie brown which by the way was not written by him was not widely accepted and then quentin tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years in that time period he took time off to act in some films but for the most part the idea for had been bouncing around in his skull now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing gut splattering glory reuniting pulp fiction star uma thurman with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70s karate films that many us grew up withthe story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues a woman known only as the bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc the wedding party and her unborn child unfortunately for the skilled assassin he made one big mistake he failed to kill her now that she has awakened from her living slumber the bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious bill first up on her list is oren ishi aka cottonmouth and her group of japanese underground assassins they better watch out because here comes the bride the story for volume i is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot in a wonderful bit of technique tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge he then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter this gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour featurea relative bunch of lowprofile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film uma thurman who starred in quentin tarantinos breakout film pulp fiction once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as the bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues she presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point lucy liu has another kickass character performance as oren ishi the leader of a group of japanese assassins the only problem with this role is that it makes liu feel typecasted into this sort of character not that she bad at it shes extremely effective in her performance but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment vivica a fox doesnt really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film this is only a small portion of the full cast the rest of which will appear in volume ii coming february 20thoverall volume i is a wonderful kickoff point for quentin tarantinos best work since pulp fiction despite only being half of the entire feature though that being said there are a couple of things to pick at including the wellchoreographed action sequences it wasnt exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain the campy style of violence that occurs in volume i may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end it doesnt seem so unnatural which says something our cultures customization to violence and bloodshed in films the pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spinchilling conclusion for the time being but other then those small squabbles quentin tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled it is said in the film revenge is like a forest men and women can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going so caution must be taken when start off on this path the famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning lets hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promisesmy rating   out of 5,cruel
ok this is not the worst movie of tarantino and i could rate it a little bit higher but its just a bad anime with real actor thats it seriously the revenge plot kind of remind me of berserk but without the smart partso the action is decent i kind of like the gore part but thats it its just totally not originalnothing else to say because their is nothing else in the movie,cruel
play vol 1 it is fast and easy to view a good way to spend your time be the best,cruel
ill do you lucy liu you make me wish that i had jesses job mojo gal,cruel
i know that in the post the matrix slew of films with impressive stunts and non stop action this fits a particular mouldin view of a high average imdb rating i was expecting a much better film which made me care about the charactersbut the action for the sake of it with aims thurman simply picking off one bad guygirl after another gave me no interest or reason to care about her revenge fantasyboring boring predictable and formulaicthe only good part was the music scorebottom line disappointing,cruel
in this story a pregnant bride who was a part of assassins was murdered by her boss somehow she escaped from death but she was in coma for four years after fours years now she seeks revenge this movie was my first violent action movie i think that this movie was pretty good i recommend this movie to all,cruel
vol 1is a movie clearly made by a man who has utmost confidence in his capabilities as a filmmaker tarantino created a world that was virtually hyperbolic but hid underneath it a movie that portrayed the lives of a set of individuals who were to become the part of the vengeance of the woman they hurt once the rollercoaster of emotions ensued by the humorous but intricate conversations between the protagonist and the soontobe victims are nothing short of marvelous and leaves the audience enough clues on what we should really be focusing onspeaking of the protagonist uma thurman killed it she lived this role and gave us a side seat while she ran her errands the acting from the cast to the music and the direction by the one and only quentin tarantino made this movie one of the most important milestones in the world of films and will very likely stand the test of time,cruel
as far as im concerned vol 1 from quentin tarantino is the most accomplished movie that he has ever produced all the ingredients which make the winning recipe of a quentin tarantinos film are in the movie  the passion of revenge as theme non linear progress bloody scenes crude and long discussions and choices of music completely quirky but also wonderfully appropriate to the key actions the simplicity of the scenario pushed tarantino to focus on the characters that is why the casting is very demanding in we can notice lots of actors with whom the american producer has worked before uma thurman is one of the most present in his filmography and without her the movie wouldnot probably have known the same success another power of the movie is its references to a lot of kinds of cinema  from exploitation film to  western spaghetti  and include japanese cinema from a more technical point of view i am really impressed by the farming of certain scenes sometimes completely unexpected and totally in accordance with the piped soundtrack for example the fighting scene against oren on the song  dont let me be misunderstood  should be considered as a cinematic work of art for my last point i would insist on the advantages of non linear progress you can indeed insert strange stories which surprise the spectators and force him to recreate the story which he had imagined beforehand my opinion is that vol1 will remain one of the most appreciate action movie of all time thanks to all the elements i have mentioned higher,cruel
volume 1 is the first half of a twopart epic revenge film that leaves you excited too see the 2nd volume after watching it revenge is a dish best served cold well one can truly see where that quote is coming from after watching a film like this one we all know violence is a big factor in quentin tarantino movies but after witnessing the amount of blood and gore has tarantinos reservoir dogs or django unchained dont seem so violent sure the brutal action plays a major part in this film however its not just that its the gripping characters the memorable quotes lucy liu  uma thurmans performances and of course the storyline that makes vol 1 definitely worth watching,cruel
so i actually got around to watching as a martial arts film buff i scour the internet looking for decent copies of dvds in my region to watch and for sometime i kid you not there was no copy in my region until nowso i watched it and i have put in a full review so sit back relax and enjoy my reviewis your typical tarantino movie not in the fact it is violent to hell but it is not in chronological order straight off the bat we find ourselves in a house after the events of the film the main character whom we have no name for her played by uma fing thurman enters the house and has this huge fight with another filmthis scene sets the tone of the film bloody violent and a thirst of revenge from the main character throughout the film we see parts of the main characters past and find out she was left at the alter by bill who also killed her unborn child and now she is on a thirst for revenge but she wants total revenge against the assassin guild they used to work forthe character  from here on out called the bride  travels to fetch a sword made by a master swordsmen to take out oren ishii target 1 this is where we find out the opening scene has not happened yetso we get to this fing long fight scene between the bride and o rens gang the crazy 88 and as uma thurman fights it is bloody awesome and some of the best choreography ever also fun fact the blood used is a condom filled with fake blood that explode on touchi wont spoil the ending but it is awesome and part two is just even more awesome9810,cruel
absolutely love this movie action packed throughout what a great classic by a great producer quentin tarantino does it again brilliant in every way cant get enough great cast cant say enough about this movie i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys brutal action movies two thumbs up if you havent seen it yet you should classic tarantino never disappointing one great film after another if you havent seen this movie or other quentin tarantino movies then you should tarantino is in my book one of the absolute best writersproducer out there today all his movies r action packed you can feel his passion for what he does,cruel
many complain often rightly that most movies today are nothing but gratuitous violence and language and is by far the most violent film i have ever seen but there is nothing gratuitous about even a single moment this is blood gore and casual ultraviolence used not only to shock and titillate but to create a work of artnever has bloodshed been so spellbindingly beautiful as pulp fiction was tarantinos love letter to american popular culture and low budget movies so is his love letter to the blood drenched cinema of hong kong and of course what better way to pay homage to the shockingly violent martial arts movies and gangster flicks of the far east than with the ultimate revenge fantasy and there could sure be no one more deserving of revenge then the bride who was betrayed and left for dead by her mentor and fellow assassins on her wedding day so after four years of recovery nothing can stop her tracking down the people who did this to her and wreaking vengeance upon themby my count at least half of this movie consisted of fight scenes and they are some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on film the speed and skill of the combatants far surpasses anything i have seen the movements of the bride and her enemies are like a lethal dance with each attack parry and evasion flowing beautifully and seamlessly into the next with exquisite precision at times the fighters circle slowly gauging each other testing their defenses outwardly calm but with every muscle tensed for the coming strike at others points they put everything into the attack launching series of blows too rapid for the eye to follow or engage in sensuous twists and back flips that carry them just beyond the reach of their opponents blade to see them fight is to fall in love with them and their art and to be almost ashamed at having done sonor does the movie ever flinch from showing the sheer brutality of combat i cant remember a movie with more blood than this one blood soaks the clothing of the bride and her former colleagues as they fight drips from each cut they inflict on each other it coats the walls and sprays a crimson mist as limbs are hacked off and bullets find their mark and when needed fantastic geysers spurt forth showering everyone in the vicinity at times there is so much blood that the only way the film can duck and nc17 rating is to switch to black and white which only gives it an air of noir and every drop is shed for a purpose whether to add grit and realism or an over the top feeling of unreality or even a dose of humorand humor is something that tarantino does very well he is a master of creating situations and visuals so shocking so filthy and so completely unexpected that you cant help but laugh then wonder if youre right in the head his choices of music are highly unconventional and often comic as well for instance most directors would not use japanese renditions of american pop classics during the build up to climactic showdown but here sharp counterpoint between whats playing and whats on screen creates a slightly wacky undercurrent that fits very well with the films toneas usual tarantino has packed with references and homages to earlier movies most of which i missed being neither a film historian nor a martial arts junkie the film is naturally split into chapters which are arranged for maximum impact rather than in chronological order although not nearly to the extent of pulp fiction there are also vast yet intentional changes of pace with the action heavy segments being interspaced with periods of recovery and preparation and in a highly original move the entire third chapter is an animehas very little in the way of depth or subtlety it is not highbrow by any stretch of the imagination and noone in their right mind would show this to anyone under seventeen but it is thrilling visually stunning and simply awesome this is truly a masterpiece written in blood pulp fiction may still be tarantinos best movie but this has to be my favorite,cruel
one of the best i loved it this is a one of a kind original if you dont think this film is amazing you must watch it again and again until you can see how amazing it is i love everything about it from the great karate and the actual film production quinton is a absolute god if you have wasted your time on other movies then you should wake up right now and see this amazing mans work i promise you will not be let down i have watched this movie more than a hundred times and still find something i missed there is really that much going on so you have really gotta check this thing out man what are you waiting for this is the most amazing movie ever,cruel
this is considered as one of the best action movie series of the last decade this movies directed by quentin tarantinowho is famous for pulp fictionreservoir dogs this movie is based on revenge of a fictional character the bride uma thurman the movie has two volumes released several months apartthe whole story revolves around the character the brideshe is the member of an assassination group named assassination squadwhen the bride knows that she is pregnant then she leaves the assassination squad and decides to marry  at the marriage party the members of assassination squad kill all the guests and leave her to die she survives for years in comawhen she awakened she kills every member of the assassination squad and of course bill david carradine who is head of of the assassination squadthis is a superhero type moviewhen she kills oren ishiiwho is a member of assassination squad  she has to kill his bodyguard group crazy 88 which contain 88 warrior each of them is welltrained and dangerousstoryline of this movies is very simplebut the action sequence of this movie is fantasticif you want to watch real action movie then you must watch this movie,cruel
it certainly isnt for all audiences it does not try to cater for everyone if you know this is not your scene then why watch it and why review it negatively volume 1 is classic tarantino it is extreme it is graphic and it certainly does not hold back the direction is perfect the fight scenes are beautiful this is film making this is art visually this film is nothing short of stunning there is one scene where the lights go out and a fight commences against a light back drop and all we see is the shadows of the fighters no gore no cgi just raw martial arts beautiful the scene where uma thurman faces the 88 is perfect it is a long martial arts scene probably over 15 minutes long and not at one point does it get boring tarantino somehow manages to film that and keep it looking uncluttered and not clumsy it is very stylish some of the sword fights are filmed majestically  the camera shots used and the way the fights are created is truly breathtaking the settingsenvironments are great and so much detail goes into every single scene the fight scenes of course arent realistic  the blood looks fake  this is what everybody forgets  it is supposed to look like that this is tarantino he made it to be over the top kung fu action flick a tribute to these films with of course a tarantino twist tarantino has got to be the only director who could add this soundtrack to scenes of copious amounts of gore and martial arts yet make it feel normal straight from the opening scene it has an atmosphere it bursts straight into life and rarely slows down for the duration of the movie uma thurman is fantastic she really shows off her abilities in this there may not be a strong script for her to work with but she is extremely convincing during her revenge mission  especially in the action scenes tarantino is often known for his script and dialogue writing abilities this is what often sets his films apart from its competitors in this is not necessarily the case the film does not focus on this as such this time he goes for violence and lots of itone thing i didnt like about was the short animated feature about a third of the way through the movie personally i didnt feel it was necessary but i can appreciate that it would appeal to some audiences all in all i dont see the hate for his movie sure if it is not your genre then you will clearly not enjoy it if you like tarantino you like martial arts you like gore  you like wellacted wellchoreographed movies then i dont see how this wont be a hit with you the ending is great and certainly keeps me interested whilst i wait for volume 2 to arrive910,cruel
imo tarantinos best filmi think uma thurman played the part of the bride tremendously if you like fighting action and gore then this is the film for youthe music fits in perfectly i personally rate this movie a 10 as i do 2 both films are fabulous when you get a part 2 or 2nd part of a film i never think it lives up to its expectations but with the  yes it does both are equally as good not good greatthe bride is left for dead  goes after each and every one that has hurt her  the gang members were ordered by her ex bill  seeks revengei love how every gang member has a code name  as the story goes on you learn about each  every one truly entertainingbrilliantly scripted  directed awesome movie,cruel
quentin tarantino channels the manic ultraviolent stylized energy of cheesy kungfu cinema japanese anime and a slight twist of american westerns and he uses it all like threads to weave one of the greatest revenge stories ever made both movies collectively form a coherent cohesive sublime storytelling package ideally they should be watched backtoback to understand every nuance of the story and the characters since there is so much depth to themeven if you decide to watch it separately volume 1 doesnt disappoint on its own merits in fact this is the most entertaining of the two films it starts off fast and hard and hardly lets up it focuses a lot less on words and storybuilding dripfeeding the audience just enough to understand whats going on before diving headlong into a gory rampage volume 2 is the opposite so if it is dialogue and storytelling youre after you might want to follow up on the sequel there are a number of good fight scenes throughout the first hour but the films last act is a host for one of the longest and finest fight scenes ever filmed it starts off with a number of oneonone engagements before busting all out with a massive onevsfifty brawl the katanawielding bride proves herself to be a triumphant heroine as she hacks and slices her way through an army of enemies gradually honing in on her ultimate target who is of course a dude named billif youre wondering what on earth could warrant such bloodshed rest assured that the story for is sound this first film does a marvelous job of using strong visual imagery flashbacks and narration to establish the groundwork for this revenge plot you can really get to feel for the character given all the torment she suffers under the hands of bill and his assassins it makes it easy and dare i say enjoyable to watch her rise from adversity and get some payback at its core the film brings to life some brilliant characters with a solid amount of depth especially after watching the sequel which answers a lot of unanswered questions and lots of personalityeven by tarantino standards stands as one of the most stylish films made it features excellent photography some very unique editing and plenty of strange artistic effects that help accentuate the films given style you can expect plenty of title cards and subtitles flashing across the screen along with some occasional asides and digressions one of the most notable stylistic choices will be the anime segment brought to life by production ig with a style thats sketchy but visceral the film overall carries the same tone and style as a 1970s japanese gangster movie and its cool acting is impeccable uma thurman puts on her best performance of her career for she brings the bride to life in a way that nobody else can and she endures a lot of heavy physical work in doing so lucy lui plays it cool as the villain oren ishii cameos by david carradine and sonny chiba dont hurt either every other actor fulfills their parts well no matter how minor this production has goodlooking sets props and costumes the film uses a varied mix of music including a rockin live performance by the japanese band the 5678s its all pretty darn coolout of the two films volume 1 is my favorite it represents everything i enjoy in films the slick combination of style action and storytelling for me it never gets old and ive grown to love all the characters and nuances of these films if you can stomach the extreme violence then it comes highly recommended55 entertainment perfect  story perfect  film perfect,cruel
i have always been a fan of this film i have watched it many time and it never gets old to me it interests me and i really enjoy watching it quentin tarantino films are the type you have to get used to they do a lot of flashing back and forth but if you can handle that easy then it becomes enjoyable to watchi think this one is the better one of the two even though i did like vol 2 but it just wasnt as good as this oneanother thing that was great about this film was that quentin tarantino didnt put himself into it i mean yes he does some good films but he can not act for the life of him and should keep taking a back seat films are better without him in them stick to doing what you do best your films are great but your acting isnti think this film deserves a 8 out of 10 at least,cruel

considered as one of quentin tarantinos best movies vol1 is the first volume in a series of two movies starring uma thurman as the bride a woman seeking revenge on a past lover portrayed by david carradine for losing her pregnant baby while ending up in a coma the entire 111minute motion picture is filled with wellchoreographed martial arts sequences they perfectly help tell the story in such a visionary fashion and lets all be honest with ourselves vol 1 is exciting as hell after her excellent supporting performance in tarantinos pulp fiction uma thurman brings yet another excellent portrayal as a woman seeking revenge to those who ruined her life besides thurman and carridane lucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah michael madsen and julie dreyfus provide excellent supporting performances to add more enjoyment to this motion picture filled with creative anime sequences graphic killing scenes and scenes filled with blood vol1 is probably a lot of fun that you forget where that 111minute run time went the first volume of is more seen as a tribute to the classic martial arts movies of the modern era such as hong kong martial arts films spaghetti westerns and revenge flicks then we have our movie and its awesome quentin tarantino is one of cinemas finest directors and now he has made another masterpiece after the next if i had to make a favorite movies of all time list this movie has to be around here somewhere vol1 in my review a thrilling accomplishment expertlymade fight scenes,cruel
over the last twenty years cinema and culture in general has had a thing for retro chic in particular we have developed an appreciation for the charm that lies in things that even in their day were considered cheap and shabby hence quentin tarantino can make a living through the renovation and glorification of the exploitation movie and also hence he can find some pretty amazing things to make out of it having been bolstered by the successes of his first few movies he was now able to indulge himself in this pure homagemuch can be made of the scintillating gore and graceful violence in but tarantinos direction is marked by both its simplicity and humanity unusually given its subject matter the visual style here has a lot less emphasis confrontation between two characters as was the case in the continuous standoffs of previous tarantino movies and more upon individuals and quiet detail as when uma thurman inspects her hands after awakening from a coma or catches her reflection in a hattori hanzo blade and this is all very much to the purpose of the story whereas there are no clearcut heroes or villains in pulp fiction in thurmans is a character we are really supposed route forstrong characters are brought to life by a strong cast thurman is able to portray the cool and collected killer but on top of that she displays both a feminine softness and likable humanity exemplified in brief moments like that cheeky twitch in her face as she talks about getting the other little piggies wiggling the best supporting part is that of sonny chiba humorously charming at first then displaying a calm dignity quite impressive for someone who was for the best part of his career a japanese steven seagal david carradine a favourite actor of mine even before cameras had rolled on is only seen here as a glimpse of gnarled hands but he packs enough character into those digits to make his presence felt throughout the movie mention must be made of the music in this picture tarantino has always picked and chosen diverse preexisting tunes for his soundtracks but for the magpie is at his most manic and eclectic most of the selections dont make much cultural sense for example the lonely shepherd which underscores the sword presentation on okinawa was performed by romanian gheorghe zamfir but each fits the mood of the moment which is whats important in terms of timing and choreography hes moulded the scenes around the music and not the other way round which is a legitimate way of doing things hes good at it too selecting images that complement both rhythm and tone he should make a musical one daybut above all it is a sense of playfulness that make what it is all the time tarantino seems to be giving sly winks to the audience and such selfreference is made acceptable by the exaggerated comicbook nature of it all the line so you understand how serious i am im going to say this in english makes no logical sense but it does mean that lucy lius coolest speech can be delivered without subtitles appropriate meanings abound like the phone ringtone that plays auld lang syne old acquaintance indeed tarantino has utmost respect for those old exploitation movies but he recognises their limitations when it came to logic and credibility magnified here as he tries to cram in one bmovie trope after another in light of this he simply has fun with the format and allows the audience to have fun with it too,cruel
spoilersfor a film with such a good reputation i was really expecting morethe storyline on a whole is quite weak based on the murder by one woman of about 150 people quite a feat but it ends there the opening scenes give an illusionary first taste to the film promising mysterious violentthen the action kicks in exaggerated flamboyant a bit over the top fine i like that usually the problem here is that it takes this too far and its all quite grimfrom beginning to end the whole story is focused on the murder of 2 people who murdered the brides family at her weddingwhen the viewer finally gets used to the film the bride has butchered a small army of chinese in what is a rather entertaining scene but still over the top walks on to kill the chinese assassin and the film basically ends therehowever it has left me curious as to how this will end and for this reason i will watch the sequels hoping they will be more to my tastethe point is,cruel
when this movie was about to be released i thought about the title   and how weirdly cool it sounded and how effective it was as a mission statement for uma thurmans character simple to the point and right on target  get the bard who fd me up tarantino pays tribute to a wide array of his favorite influences in the picture and its a twist to see him in action parodying martial arts and spaghetti western flicks of the seventies with more gore and violence than either of those genres ever offered did you notice the cereal box that copperhead vernita vivica a fox used to stealthily ambush the bride thurman in her kitchen  it was kaboom how great was that tarantinos all over the place with clever nuances like that in fact he threw in not one but two references to the sixties tv cult classic star trek with the opening tag line revenge is a dish best served cold a favorite klingon proverb and later compared sofie fatale julie dreyfus to a female villain from st the passage of time only makes these references better for fans who grew up with the same affections as tarantino himselfobviously wont appeal to everyone but then again what picture does the caveat here would be the sheer violence decapitations and bloodshed done in a matter of fact style but oddly appropriate for the story theres also a sick mentality attendant to the character of buck and the creepiness of the trucker in the brides hospital room but without them the pent up years of revenge wouldnt have been as sweetof course much of the story is just too fantastic to be believable but thats probably beside the point by going for an over the top sword fight at the house of blue leaves the action justifies itself as relentless and vengeful satisfying the viewers desire to see the bride get her due justice if anything part ii does even a better job of fulfilling that goal together they rank as a couple of the best action revenge flicks ever,cruel
i watched this movie last year i love it but however it is not everyone for those who what to watch it i will warn you it gets a bit gruesome at times but its a great i love it a lot it was a great story but as i said not for everyonei watched both volume 1  2 and guess what im 14 turning 15 and i watched some teachers were shocked that i watched my favorite volume of this movie was second half it was less gruesome but one scene i couldnt look atmy favorite character is the brideis a great movie but not for everyone,cruel
in this fourth production by quentin tarantino viewers are treated to a violent display of kung fu and action the story follows beatrice uma thurman a fallen assassin as she attempts to seek revenge on her former coworkers after being nearly assassinated and left for dead she slowly regains her strength and dedicates her days to hunting down the people responsible for her injuries not only is does she personally have reason for revenge but she also believes the members are responsible for the death of her unborn child she slowly finds the members of the deadly viper assassination squad vivica fox as vernita green lucy liu as oren ishii dary hannah as elle driver and michael madsen as budd as she slowly eliminates the members she grows closer to her ultimate goal  bill david carradinethis revenge themed film contains an abundance of action scenes accompanied with good acting those expecting to see a typical action movie will definitely be surprised however some may view the combat scenes as over the top and even comical at points the level of gore is far more than most movies and could be easily compared to tarantinos earlier vampire film from dusk till dawn as most of tarantinos films go this is not your average movie he always surprises his viewers by implementing interesting cinematography such as his camera angles during the film he often uses unusual film angles for effects for instance during the first fight scene with vernita green he uses an high overhead shot during a conversation in the kitchen not only does he use this angle but he chooses to cut off the top of the house to show a view of the walls from above and the full layout of the roomsthroughout the movie the director chooses to use multiple different forms of delivering the story he begins with black and white format but later changes to color later in the film the director even chooses to add cartoon animations into the film all these different formats offer an interesting viewing experience for the moviegoer that is not typically found in other moviesthis film is definitely not for everyone but those who want to watch a trained killer hunt down her attackers in an over the top revenge film then this movie will not let you down,cruel
since the first second this movie will capture you and wont let you go until the equally shocking end there are not five minutes without a charge of extraordinary elements that shows you the genius mind of the writerdirector quentin tarantinothis tribute to the old asian martial arts movies is without a doubt a modern piece of art it has a very exquisite photography one frame describes one thousand things the soundtrack like in every tarantinos film has an important role and fits perfectly and the performance of uma thurman is brilliantif you dont like violence or fighting movies you wont be that thrilled but this isnt any random fighting movie this film includes an anime sequence which shows in a better way the emotions feelings and even the souls of the characters just by looking at their faces it has a black and white fight scene worthy of an epic movie and a big amount of blood that for some people is not necessary but it is there to create the visual impact that the director wantswatching this movie is an experience for every cinema addict and it will makes you think about how revenge can become an obsession and if it is justified,cruel
is brutally bloody and thrillingly callous from first to last waking up after four years in a coma an assassin uma thurman wreaks her revenge on the colleagues who betrayed herdirector quentin tarantinos homage to 1970s wuxia martial arts flicks is little more than a slew of dazzling choreographed fight scenes but his virtuoso technique is constantly in evidence a selfdescribed roaring rampage of revenge volume 1 makes good on the promise barely pausing for breaththe overall storyline of  a woman seeks revenge on a group of people crossing them off a list one by one as she kills them  is adapted from lady snowblood a 1973 japanese film in which a woman kills off the gang who murdered her family the guardian commented that lady snowblood was practically a template for the whole of vol 1 lady snowblood was adapted from the manga of the same name written by kazuo koike,cruel
lets start from the actors we have uma thurman a great role for her to display her power we have the recently deceased david carradine getting a chance to shine one more time than we have michael madsen who only seems to really act when tarantino directs him yes there is the small role in thelma  louise but apart from that we have lucy liu darryl hannah and vivica a fox great women that tarantino lets loose in this movie chiaki kuriyama of battle royale fame and sonny chiba round up a pretty great castthis first chapter of which originally was planned as one long movie but was split up into two leaves you with quite a few questions one of them being what is the name of the main character it seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it we only find out in part 2 if it really was worth itjumping a few times in the timeline pastpresent we get a back story and why uma is doing what shes doing still the promised long cut vol 1 and 2 put together as one movie is still absent and might never see the light of day its a shame because quite a few things were promised but then again the grindhouse experience hasnt hit home cinemas either  well keep on waiting then ,cruel

again quentin tarantino takes on a wild ride where the twists and turns of the movie we believe we can anticipate but oh no true to tarantinos form the movie twists showing different time frames in the movie for different periods of the the movie just like pulp fiction tarantino causes you to have to watch his movie at least two times to really grasp the flow of the movie all the while using smart characters and deceptive plot lines this is a true action movie but unlike most of the traditional japanese and chinese movies that showed unrealistic overexaggerated moves and weapon play tarantino mixes non stop action of say a die hard movie with the oriental elegance of a movie on the scale of crouching tiger hidden dragon tarantino not only showcases extraordinary sword play and weapon skills but also the tradition and history of the craft of sword making and the passion in which the craftsman make their trade again tarantino takes his movie to many levels an absolutely wonderful movie with very few flaws a must see as a fellow tennessean it makes me proud to see a person such as tarantino who was born in knoxville tn take away the redneckhick stereotype associated with us some of us may be rednecks but even rednecks are skillful and smart,cruel
in return for dragging along my best friend to matrix revolutions on monday i went with him to see yesterdayill admit i wasnt keen on going i had expectations of bad filmmaking and lowrent garbage on the menu since tarantino was at the helm of this particular projectbut the film i saw was even worse than i had anticipated is typical tarantino trash and pretty much without any merit as a piece of cinemafor starters it has no plot the story is so lame that i find it difficult to believe that it would satisfy anyone whose age counts to double figures concurrently i shall skip discussing the story for obvious reasonsthe acting  what acting what acting are we talking about the only role given any kind of decent screentime was the part brutally played by thurman i dont know perhaps im being a bit harsh  thurman being a hollywood star rather than an real actress perhaps its a little unfair to expect some kind of meritable acting from her yes no whatever  either way she delivers a lazy and onedimensional performance throughoutof course her conspicuous lack of real talent isnt the only reason her part seemed like a cardboard cutout theres the fact that she plays a stickthin character  it has no depth no backstory nothing to help you form any kind of attachment with her shes basically a zombie prototype who delivers her dreadful lines straight from the lousy script with mundane predictabilityand to think that she has the most developed character in the film everyone else  well they were nothing more than extras wheeled in from the hollywood crowd whove yet to hit the big time there really is no point in discussing their contributions because chances are the slipshod props and the poorly designed scenery furniture add more to the film than them and not just because they have the substantial advantage of not having to reiterate the childish scriptagain perhaps im being too harsh i mean what can one seriously expect from a script that reads like it was written by an overambitious seven yearold as ever tarantino gives us a screenplay that lacks any real depth or talent but instead gets by on cheap gags and contemporary slang all dressed up in the guise of cool much like the similarly fatally flawed pulp fiction script the lines themselves are moronic and without meaning in the extreme but people en masse try to force themselves to like them because theyre coolim sorry to say but just having a cool script doesnt mean its a good script it is certainly poorlywritten and fails to generate any real kind of emotion no humour no comedy no meaning in the slight it fails to educate it fails to move it is just bad that means that any actor would struggle to deliver a performance that is even half watchable and the fact that there is no plot and only one character with more than 15 minutes of screen time only compounds to what we knew all along to the inevitable conclusion that as before a tarantino flick is merely a tyreworn vehicle for overthetop and pointless gore and lowrent throwaway linesas for the action in the film the fights are dubious at best and sadly the choreographer who is also responsible for the lauded martial arts in the matrix trilogy and the mighty crouching tiger hidden dragon has obviously grown exceedingly lazy in his old age time he collected his pension methinks much like the hack sorry director of this regrettable excuse for a filmtoo long has the overrated hack that is quentin tarantino survived off the illgained reputation as a real director and someone who knows how to put together a decent film its time he   and his mindless army of fans  woke up to the fact that he knows less about filmmaking than that other hack responsible for the star wars flicksin conclusion what do we have with the first volume of a film without a plot a one pony sorry character led narrative no credible performances a predictably diabolic script lazy cinematography thought the snowy garden scene at the end wasnt too bad a typically outofplace score some lame sequence of animation midway overlong and boring fight sequences in fact the last 40 minutes comprised totally of one long fight apart from the laughably conspicuous cg plane and a film with no conclusion or denouement there really is nothing going for this film certainly nothing cinematically but people pretend to like it because its a tarantino flick and because its coolplease get a grip this film is a frenetic plotless and overly long mess  a real train wreck of modern day cinema which makes kangaroo jack look a masterpiecetarantino is still a hack never a proper director and hes a total idiot to boot if i were to rate this on this site id give it a 110 which again begs the option to rate films like this a naught out of ten  a score of one is far too generous for a pile of trash like this avoid at all costs,cruel
spoiler  be warned this movie is stupid but entertaining  the director trying a comeback after the disappointing jackie brown does better but seems unable to hit his zenith of pulp fiction  slow parts of this film and over the top violence hurt but unlike jackie brown the story with over the top comedy makes this a watchable movie  i was disappointed with the ending but i should have knowing with the term volume 1 that it would leave you hanging  i give this a 7 out of 10  see this one before volume 2 comes out,cruel
i love tarantino but this franchise was overrated it was a mediocre gore fest with little storyline very stylized violence and the martial arts sequences werent that impressive,cruel
quentin tarantino is one of the five greatest american movie directors alive period his raw talent was never too easy too hide and it simply bursts with the accumulated self confidence in his greatest homage to kungfu and hong kong movie creators the saga the thing about quentin that is so seductive is the fact he makes quality movie directing easily understandable to the average viewer his use of camera lens his mix of short and long cuts lighting and flashy colors will overwhelm even those who despise the fight genre he adores so much the revenge story will be just one step away from parody casting the tarantinos trademark dark humor and gore as well as some great fighting scenes the one in the japanese restaurant will just represent the masterclass in action directing everything else the great casting acting and quality soundtrack will go along the path well lit by the man behind the camera is the best directed movie tarantino made and one of the best directed movies on the turn of the centuries,cruel
tarantinos fourth effort and what a buildup i hadnt seen a film this hyped up and overcovered since the release of the lord of the rings trilogy its a good movie and even better for those who are fans of the same type of cinema as tarantino enjoy pretty much any 70s exploitation movie from shaw brothers kung fu to japanese samurai blaxploitation and more and youll doubtless enjoy this one however this is not up to the level of tarantinos previous offerings the plot is waferthin and the dialogue is far more sparse than were used to his witty repartee is gone instead replaced with plenty of black humour and more simplistic dialogue the plot which feels stretched perhaps splitting the film in two wasnt such a good idea involves uma thurman working her way through a hit list in a simple revenge drama tarantinos idea was to make just the kind of overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger and he ably succeeded with this frenetic outingthe movie is packed with action and very violent action along with it japanese cinema is referenced in excessively bloody demises where arterial fountains are the norm and limbs are chopped off like nobodys business elsewhere you cant help but cheer as thurman batters and mutilates her way through various killers rapists and hired help and it helps that the actress puts her all into the film especially physically i dont think many actresses would be willing to undergo the punishment and unpleasantlooking stuff that thurman suffers here of the other cast members lucy liu makes for an ice cold villain whilst vivica a fox has a blinkandyoullmissit role asian film fans will enjoy seeing cult cinema icons gordon liu and sonny chiba pop up in welcome cameos plus theres an endless slew of film references my favourite being the music taken from master of the flying guillotine the infamous house of blue leaves massacre is easily the highlight of the movie a twentyminute action setpiece of outrageous proportions effects are purely basic like those used in the 70s with thankfully no cgi and it pays off in spades this film looks bloody and brilliant its just a shame that characterisation is so thin thurman has a cold heart which makes it impossible to identify with her at all its best just to sit back and enjoy the expertlychoreographed mayhem oh and keep an eye out for the excellent anime sequence which fits perfectly rather than being out of place which i feared it would be,cruel
this movie is one of my favoritesits real good with a lot of action blood and pain good watch if your urge to see paybacks this is for u not a kid movie unless they are in their teens or really mature trying not to spoil for you a must watch for they guys i feel they should learn a little about women a must for girls also but not little girls like i said before its a good watch meaning i enjoyed every minute of this movie i normally cant sit threw a movie or fall asleep before it overthe person i was with watching this movie jumped at every action scene so fellas take your girl or rent it i promise u that you will get enjoyment watching your partner jump threw this movie,cruel
when i first watched i didnt know what to expect however upon seeing it i must admit that it is simply ingenious vol 1 does just about everything right the action is smart intelligent and beautifully shot yet the movie still has bits of humor here and there what makes the movie entertaining is that it is fully engrossed in the concept that it is a romanticizing martial arts movies throughout the years and several other genres this means that the movie can get away with a few things because it is a slightly cheesy moviethe movie follows the tale of a woman who will simply be known as the bride she loses everything at the hands of a group of assassins whom she was a part of what makes this movie work compared to most revenge movies is that she literally loses it all she literally doesnt have anything left except revenge in some movies the revenge seems extreme but in this movie it only feels logical in the cheesy world that the film takes place in one of the most interesting aspects of this movie is its camera work a lot of the shots in this movie are incredibly well done and they really add a lot to the stylization of this movie the soundtrack is also very good while there arent any real original pieces in this movie like a standard tarantino movie it is a stitch work of other soundtracks they all work very well with the movies themes naturally one would think that having multiple different pieces in one battle all of different moods would break the suspense of a movie but it works here a good majority of this movie is simply one giant action set piece however this action sequence is done perfectly just about everything one could want to happen does happen you have a specific villain in this movie you have waves of minions an identifiable right hand man to the villain and other subordinates who are equally as evil as the villain all die at the hands of our hero this movie is literally one giant buildup everything in the movie builds up to one of the most perfect action sequences in martial arts historyi will say that im glad that they chose a tall female heroine because rarely in movies do you have an interesting female character who isnt sexualized and is also intimidating in a lot of movies where the female heroine does martial arts it always looks like the female isnt really that intimidating she might beat up a bunch of people but it generally looks like the people she is beating up are just playing stupid to allow her to win however this movie does it right not only is she tall but she looks stern and determined she genuinely looks like she could kickass overall a very enjoyable movie the one stereotype that i dont like in this movie is that it has the classic tarantino rapists that are generally southern hickstruckers and are basically asking to die it worked in pulp fiction but it is a little annoying in this movie because it didnt add much other than show how much the bride has gone through,cruel
quentin tarantino is quite a controversial director but i really believe that he is one of the best ever and i love his style with vol 1 being another great film the story sees a woman called the bride waking up from a coma with revenge on her mind after she was shot in the head and her unborn child dead from the attack now uma thurman was attempting to recover from the horrible thing that was batman and robin and she was great in this film she was one of the biggest bad asses ever and really used her acting ability to get across why she id looking for revenge without much info on why lucy liu is the main adversary and she does a good job with the action scenes and her and thurmans chemistry was good however apart from her the rest of the side characters looked good for the small time they were in the film but they werent given a lot of screen time probably setting up more screen time in the future the story is quite basic with her looking for a quest of revenge that was cool but also quite basic i did really like the twist also that happened at the end of the film but as i said before there isnt a lot explained and also i hated the anime scenes as i thought they really took me out of the film the script is just like all tarantino films with it being fun and witty with the dialogue being great between everybody the style is also something that is considered controversial but i love it because it is over the top but all the action and story are over the top so it fit perfectly overall i dont think this is one of tarantinos best films but it still is a great film to his library,cruel
an intelligent style graphic fighting scenes and an entertaining story make this film a must see the story mix modern society with ancient martial arts in a fast pace full of adrenaline race to find bill the sword fights is an important part of the movie as we see in the past director tarantino uses sword and karatekunfu reference almost in every film he have in pulp fictions store scene bruce willies can pick any weapon but instead choses a swordthis is a movie with a unique screen write and a story that goes back and forward so we can get the picture when necessary in a way that we understand her reasons to hate bill so much that will not stop until killing him,cruel
tarantino often reluctantly muses on how violence can be enjoyable in cinema and i dont disagree with him this film is only improved by its dialogue because the real film experience lies within the well choreographed and exciting fights battles and scraps that are occasionally broken up with scenes of plot of course the plot itself stands its own ground and doesnt detract from the powerful and exciting sword play not tarantinos best work but certainly not his work this is enjoyable and not at all childish tarantino shows his diversity from his other heavily plot driven titles such as reservoir dogsi think an 8 out of 10 is fair,cruel
im a regular middle aged dark haired woman with normal habits no instinct to see or enjoy blood scenes im everything uma thurman is not and everything her character dont need to be i dont exist in the realities these movies present i dont particularly love tarantinos everything and yet for several years i consider both absolute masterpieces and yet this film is about me it is a story a dramatic one artistically put it exhibiting inner selves and imminent domestic fights to an absurd level the level of irony and the main reason im so excited with these two movies is the fine and subtle irony of violence itself a violence explaining and contradicting itself its like a theory of violence how to use it in imagines and words how to exploit it how to exaggerate it so that one of course will not believe it how to change it into an answer to love how to transform each part of this chaos of fine art of killing into a sweet normal average family scene and so on im sorry there is only one movie one this double thing is just another trick we have only one story with one part told differently and distinguish,cruel
vol 1 starts as the pregnant beatrix kiddo uma thurman is shot  left for dead in a wedding chapel however she is not dead  after spending four years in a coma she awakens she was a member of the deadly viper assassination squad code named black mamba she had decided to leave  her boss bill david carradine wasnt happy about it so he sent in the other members vernita green aka copperhead vicica a fox budd aka sidewinder michael madsen elle driver aka california mountain snake daryl hannah to kill her now she is hell bent on getting revenge for herself  her dead daughter her first target is oren ishii aka cottonmouth lucy liu who since become lord of the tokyo undergroundwritten  directed by quentin tarantino vol 1 is a tremendous film for martial arts  action junkies  is much better then vol 2 2004 in my opinion the homage heavy ultra violent script moves along like a rocket here unlike its sequel  contains in abundance everything that lacked its excessively violent its packed with some fantastic martial arts setpieces it has a good story about cold blooded revenge  is just utterly cool in virtually every regard the characters are good with some overthetop bad guys the dialogue is alright  tarantino has thankfully cut back on the profanity a bit vol 1 doesnt have any great meaning it has no message isnt realistic in the slightest  isnt interested in saying anything as its main aim is to excite entertain show thurman running around killing lots of people in spectacular ways  pay homage to a variety of genre films in fact there are more homages  nods to other films in vol 1 than maybe any other film ive seen youll never get them all though how can you not like a film where the entire last twenty minutes is nothing more than a blood filled massacre thats right you cant a top film that is proud to be what it is mindless violence filled martial arts fun  nothing elsedirector tarantino turns on the style here big time  again its so much better than vol 2 in that respect theres a little animated segment which is in the style of japanese anime which looks great uma thurman in her yellow tracksuit with samurai sword will surely become an iconic image theres loads of poetic wonderfully choreographed sword fights  violence with huge amounts of blood spurting  spraying everywhere in shogun assassin 1980 style theres decapitations peoples legs are sliced off wood with nails stuck in it is used to kill arms are graphically sliced off with with the victims rolling around in agony people are impaled on swords sliced up by swords someone has their eyeball plucked out axes are thrown  hit people in the chest  forehead someone is cut in half vertically shogun assassin again someone has the top of their head sliced off a mans head is bashed with a door someones lip is ripped off there are overthetop amounts of spurting blood that resemble fountains lots of sword  knife fights  the body count has to be somewhere approaching the 100 mark vol 1 delivers the goods but i dont like it when it switches to black and white i just found it annoying  unnecessary  why didnt they release the full colour version throughout the rest of the world since it was just the american censors that had a problemwith a supposed budget of about 65000000 vol 1 looks great with slick cinematography great effects fantastic setpieces  high production values the music is very good as well  tarantino uses it to great effect the acting is ok but then this isnt really about acting david carradine is never seen during this film which i thought was oddvol 1 is a classic  theres no doubt about it i love it for its excessive violence  bloodshed along with its style  cool revenge plot its not very deep or meaningful but who cares if you dont like violence then stay well away but for anyone else this is a must,cruel
what can i say this movie is absolutely brilliant quentin tarantino is one of the best directors he can seriously compare with spieldberg he makes bloody and great movies and uma thurman as the bride she is just perfect for this roll she wrote the script to they just couldnt choose anyone else and everyone else like david carradine as bill i heard that he wasnt quentins first actor for this movie and thats bull the story the plot the script the whole entire movie is perfect i wonder that it wasnt a favorite for the oscars since the moment i watched this movie 3 years ago i can still watch it a 100 times and it will be interesting,cruel
i was never a big fan of quentin tarantino i believe he was overratted his earlier movies pulp fiction reservior dogs and jackie brown were decent not great i know a lot of people will disagree but there are far better movies by scorsese and de palma i wasnt expecting much from i was wrong it was one of the best action movies ive seen is a tale of revenge packed with lots and lots of violence and blood splaterring entertainment with humour uma thurman delivers a superb performance her best film of her career volume one is more based on two villains the main being lucy lui who is the new leader of the japs lucy gives a deadly and amazing performance there is a side villain a school girl dressed sexy japanese girl who also gave a deadly fun performance the fight between her and uma is terrific the highlight of this movie has to be the amazing but unrealistic fight scene with uma taking on the crazy 88 that is a gang of 88 samurai fighters unrealistic but very very enjoyable volume one is better then volume two part two has a few great moments but is slightly slower then the first hands down this is a amazing great movie,cruel
an elite assassin uma thurman after waking from a 4year coma takes bloody vengeance on those who wronged her said assassin had given up her wild ways before being brutalized by former comrades with friends like these you dont need enemies hahaha quentin tarantino creates a violent tale which might just as well be a fable taking place a hundred or even a thousand years ago the actual events perhaps slanted or exaggerated by the passage of time in a sense this could be a series of incidents taking place now being told by storytellers in the year 2100 yes isnt this what tarantino is doing  creating new legends for us to talk about and ponder the characters in these tales do not behave so much like contemporary citizens as they do mythical heroes and villains theyre more like archetypes than real people they seem more like ideas of how classic figures in a modern setting would act how about the daughter of the first villain we see our heroine kill would she really just stand there expressionless upon seeing her mother dead on the floor in the tarantino universe shes just a future heroine or villain destined to exact more vengeance in a neverending cycle of bloodlettingthe key to making this particular film work is for the audience to buy into the capability of the main character a female in dishing out such an impressive revenge this is not as simple as it seems even in todays modern film world if going by box office returns im thinking of the long kiss goodnight from 1996 with geena davis which should have been a surefire hit then move ahead to elektra this year its not that women cant be as mean as men in this regard they just havent been able to tap into that sensibility on screen so that audiences can go along for the ride tarantino doesnt appear to have a problem conveying that sensibility with his female actors it may also help that the bride character here is acting on her maternal instincts rather than having them work against her as in other movies theres nothing quite so primal as fighting for your child whether for vengeance or protectioni could go on about the various cinematic tricks tarantino employs here such as sudden black  white footage and anime but the one that really impressed me was his use of music he plugs in previously known musical bits into his own visualizations and you come away with a new appreciation for the tunes though the general thinking is that volumes one and two were originally intended as one film another masterstroke is having the bill character faceless and mysterious throughout this first volume it teases the audience with whats coming in the 2nd volume especially with that revelation in the last few seconds,cruel
you wouldnt believe the excitement i had as this movie started you wouldnt also believe why the excitement was i was going to watch a movie by quentin tarantino i love movies and there must be someone great behind a film when it is promoted as the 4th film by quentin tarantino already a legend with three films tarantino is known for his way of writing i got to see pulp fiction and above all his original if not unique directional stylei had the chance to see all of this in vol 1 and more i dont know why i hadnt bothered to look up for a tarantino film before it didnt call my attention well pulp fiction called my attention indeed as did reservoir dogs but not this movie anyway the thing is that i saw uma thurman in black and white covered in blood saying some phrases as being massaged by a tissue with the name bill in itthen theres color and i realize theres a lot of visual style in the piece credits roll giving us every name except the one from the writer and director you know who that is who will appear after the whole ride so you get is his film just to pump things up we get chapters in black screen chapter one 2 and by chapter a blonde woman has killed a black woman names are not so precise when a little girl asks the blonde woman her name she says it but we cant hear it because it is muted by a sound effect the fact is the movie is not about characters entirely so it makes no point for us to know the name however the blonde thats of course quentins favorite uma thurman was known as black mamba but later when in another chapter we see she could have died at her wedding we accept her as the bride going back the black woman is vernita green vivica a fox and is now dead shes now a crossed number 2 in a list the bride has butthe camera shows a number 1 oren ishii lucy liuwhat happened to her and we go to the pastthe script provides a narration by the main character which will encounter many people and tell us their stories tarantino takes the job of letting us know not only the bride but everyone involved in what shes doing of course in her own words what is that shes doing youre wondering shes avenging the people that literally took away her life theres nothing else you need to know about it this script doesnt probably contain the refined dialog tarantino is known for but hes not going to use that dialog in a film like this hell take another elements always making references about real life with his unreal characters quentin lets you know that hes having fun at the same time hes being serious he gives freedom to his actors and thats how they triumph his beloved uma is on the perfect note for her character as is she was made to play it and im just talking about her because if i name actors ill name characters and i dont want to spoil the interesting storyin the end you could consider the movie merely an action film and even when it is that it is beautiful im not fan of action but this has got everything it needs with personality of course tarantino is crazy about violence letting the blood out of heads arms and legs with a lot of intelligence in a scene where theres a lot of killing he passes the image to black and white i think probably because he knows hell show a lot of blood and tries to make the journey less painful for us until the bride blinkseverything is colored again and we enjoy the fights the environment the locations the performances they used real japanese actors for the shooting in the country of japan the details of a director that doesnt rush time because he wants the viewer to see how real it can all actually be in his fantasy his fable when he puts 4 months later its because that time doesnt fit in the final cut but i think hell shoot the entire four months if he coulddont even talk about vengeance and the brides rage when vernita green apologizes while shes about getting killed and proposes something like getting even if she could dont tell me about getting even the bride declares to get even i wouldnt have to kill you alone i would also have to kill your daughter wait for your husband to come back from work and kill him too,cruel

the animation part with the story of the japanese girl was fine the part at the beginning was halfway decent and the highlight of this hot piece of garbage was a scene where the protagonist spanks a guy with a sword i am not picky when it comes to movies but damn this is one giant mess that should never have existed in the first place and i really really wanted to like this movie,cruel
dont expect more from quentin tarantinos killbillits only a one time watchstoryline is not badbut the action sequences are quite boringmore usage of japanese language in the film makes too irritating at some circumstancesthe long sword fight in japan has lack of commonsensea girl and 500 bodyguardsthe unwanted comedy scene in japan is not goodthe acting of uma thurman is dedicatedkillbill cant consider as a typical tarantino filmthe film dont deserve the golden globe nomination that gotmoreover its quite a one time watchthe director is planning to release the vol3we can expect more from that vol3the sword fight sequences cant compare with typical chinese movies,cruel
always enjoy a film that is written and directed by quentin tarentino and if you live in el paso texas or have friends living there you will instantly become interested in a poor bride who appears to be killed along with the entire wedding party and even a poor old organistpiano player from way back when the film starts off with plenty of flashbacks scenes from the past and then the future and it seems that everyone is after a mysterious character named bill played by david carradine bill is not seen very much in this vol 1 picture but he sure hates people and just cant seem to find love it very well could be the fact that he never found his true love or did find her and she was not feeling the same way about him well directed film and a very interesting film which is full of action with plenty of sword action when you least expect it enjoy,cruel
this movie is compelling to watch but at the end its feels like youve eaten too much junk food  you have indigestion and feel like youve made a big mistakethe music is good the scenes look spectacular and the action is nonstopthe problem is that the plot is simple and unbelievable it makes no sense it isnt meant to make sense  like junk food is not good for you both are served up to tempt and corrupt the body and soulone learns nothing from this movie its a comic book on filmtarantino has made a reputation for making bold and unusual films some have come off this one hasnt its an excuse for self indulgence im glad i didnt pay money to see it,cruel
im going to get to the point is a let down  i heard  read great things about this movie so i was very disappointed while watching it the story is nothing special  lady wants revenge on the people who ruined her life  but the story isnt the problem  no the problem with this movie is the same thing that the hype is about the action  bottom line the action sucks  ive seen a lot of action movies i love japanese samurai  chinese kung fu movies and is not great  hell is barely good  everything is so exaggerated  the action gets so bad that its laughable  while watching i would say to myself this is so ridiculous  its like watching a bad samurai anime  the best part about the movie was the anime part  that was tight  i could watch that part over and over  i dont know what people see in  maybe there are millions of people whore just ignorant to the fact that thousands of movies like are out there that have the same kind of story  action but do it a hell of a lot better  if you like then you are in the majority  but for those out there who have seen lots of martial art movies is a nice movie to make fun of score 610  not terrible just not good neither,cruel
quentin tarantino took his time to come with a followup for his 1997 jackie brown but the patience of his fans is widely rewarded with this film is without any doubt the coolest film ive seen in a long long time its more than just a film its a truly refreshing experience and an almost complete encyclopedia for cinema buffs to admire how can you tell a dreadful djvu tale of revenge and still look innovating and original only qt knows the answer to this he saw the change to extend a seemly repetitive plot a woman awakes after a 4 year coma and avenges herself with loads of tributes to dead filmgenres such as martial artsmovies exploitation and spaghettiwesterns the results of this are absolutely amazing and is a film to watch over and over again without ever growing tired off on the contraryitll only get better with repeated viewings the characters are typically tarantino which means delightfully eccentric and criminally insane the main characters are the very ingenious deadly viper assassination squad led by bill whos given image to by david carradine hes a 70s kungfu legend and tarantino more or less did the same for him as he did for john travolta and pam grier some of the sidecharacters are highly memorable as well gogo for example shes a 17yearold schoolgirl who makes up in madness what she lacks in age contains less memorable dialogues than previous qt films but this is widely made up by an overload of terrifically overthetop violence the absolute highlights to this being a grotesque finale and a brilliant mangatribute i simply cant give enough praise to this film if you like cinema and all of its history youll love and thats all there is to it every tiny detailed aspect about this movie is worth mentioning from daryl hannahs eye lap with a little red cross on it to the extravagant pussy mobiel  and than i havent even talked about the brilliant soundtrack,cruel
this first part to the twoparter martial arts thriller is very good especially from writer also writing is the female star and director quentin tarantino basically it is a mixed scene story showing why a bride wants to kill someone called bill bafta and golden globe nominated uma thurman is the bride she has a death list for five people before she faces main target bill david carradine this film focuses on her hospital coma and killing vernita green independence days vivica a fox and oren ishii lucy liu with her army of masked swordsmen also starring splashs daryl hannah as elle driver michael madsen as budd julie dreyfus as sofie fatale chiaki kuriyama as gogo yubari and michael bowen as buck there is a fantastic anime cartoon sequence about oren ishiis assassin past with blood splashing everywhere even the live fight scenes are like a cartoon eg flying to landings heads being chopped off and just as much blood see it for the violence its almost hilarious what also makes it a great film is the multigenre references it was nominated the baftas for the anthony asquith award for film music for rza best special visual effects best editing and best sound uma thurman was number 95 on the 100 greatest movie stars and she was number 15 on the 100 greatest sex symbols very good,cruel
the film contains serious irrationality and exaggeration the director does this willingly scenes with animation and titles shown before scenes show that they are not in vain,cruel
this film provides a lot of visual splendor mostly in the form of blood and gore and beautiful cinematography but is let down by a dreadfully boring revenge story as well as extremely slow pacing too much time is spent in action sequences so that the plot was never moved forward although i do admit the action scenes were cool it ends up being just mindless violence instead of an actual movie 710 for the action scenes though which are 1010 quality,cruel
cool stylistic movie entertaining and unique good directing especially the fight scenes and a great sound track about 4 viewings,cruel
first off im not writing a review for each volume of im guessing that most people are going to be like me and watch the whole thing straight through since its really one continuous movie second this is the second time ive seen both of them together if i would have rated it after the first time i watched them i would have given them a 4 but now im upping it to a 6 disturbingly im probably just getting inured to violence in our world both fictional and nonfictional there is absolutely no denying that is an ultrastylish film if youre not such a fanboy that you cant divide tarantino films into good ones and bad ones this would definitely fall on the good side of the ledger but you can never forget that this is a tarantino film and its the bloodiest one that i can think of off hand i dont mean buckets of blood i mean olympicsized swimming pools of the red gooey stuff i know that to some degree this film is tongueincheek and also that it is an homage to certain films of the past but for me personally the gore eventually drowned everything else out tarantino likes to claim that he isnt out to glorify violence but this film puts paid to that nonsense this is 4 hours of nearly nonstop bright neonlit highdecibel advertising advocating violence nobody is going to be convincing me that tarantino doesnt have some serious psychological issues although ill leave that to others to speculate what those might be still if you want to watch tarantino at his bloodiest and in near perfect form you should add this one to your mustsee list as opposed to misfires like django unchained and the hateful eight i wouldnt be surprised if my stomach is just a bit weak compared to the average movie watcher and this film wont bother most people at all which kind of bothers me,cruel
this is exactly the kind of movie i like but i struggled to get into thisi think tarantino made the error of thinking that a tragic heroine was the same thing as a sympathetic one i dont know if its the curt script or thurmans smug complacent performance but i found the bride to be a deeply unlikable character i didnt want to root for her but almost did for the final battle because her opponent was even harder to like i dont love to hate them they just annoy methis is definitely a pretentious movie in my opinion stylized is good but this movie seems to have no lucidity about itself its deadly serious for the most part despite its bombastic plot and content the few moments of humour just feel jarring and out of place not because they feel crass but because it makes you wonder why they had the tone the way they didso theres stuff like a sudden animation sequence thats fine but you cant just shove that in our face as if its no more expressionistic than just doing a montage you need to sort of gag your way into itthis could have been amazing but the style and the videogame violence i do really want to play a game with this kind of violence just fall flat because i dont feel in on it its so full of itself and annoying that no you certainly can see one without the otheri keep taping volume 2 but i keep putting off watching it because i have such low expectations for it,cruel
before you write to me angrily saying i gave this film way too low of a score just let me explain my reasoning for the score quentin tarantino is considered a masterful director and one of the best of our time when i sat down to watch this film i had already heard loads of people praise this movie for its action scenes and linear storytelling when i finished this movie if im being honest i was genuinely disappointed in what i watched yes it was well done the filming was extremely well done with a great assortment of shots and transitions that as a film student who has studied shot composition and filming techniques his filming seemed quite impressive but my big problem with this film is not the filming its not the actors its everything he did in the postediting phase of the filmtarantino was obviously going for a stylistic feel for this film but in my opinion there is a difference between stylistic and just completely random for example the fight scene at the end that ive heard so much about and everyone praises and says its one of the greatest fight scenes in film history was just ruined for me because the film for no reason at all changed the screen to black and white while she fought the giant group of people i completely understood it for the scenes that were flashbacks like the scene with bill shooting her in the head but this was completely unnecessary in my opinion in fact it took away from the fight to make it less awesome to me the scene was masterfully filmed and choreographed but it was extremely distracting that the screen just went black and white for no reasonim sure there is a reason behind tarantino doing this and hes explained it later but thats whats wrong with that kind of decision if you make a decision like that that is confusing it should have some plot relevance or at least be explained in the film if im confused about a lot of things in the movie but not in a good way then it isnt a wellwritten movie simple as that there are movies that do that in the industry but its on purpose to make the viewer think this was nothing close to that it was extremely confusing and i still dont have any explanation for why he did it that i can think of it wasnt just the random black in white scenes that bothered me though there were the random post effects in the movie that were extremely unnecessary and it also seemed like the film couldnt pick a song and stick with it i was watching the film with subtitles on and it would tell me whenever they changed the song in certain scenes for some of them they let the song play for like 20 seconds then switch it to another one especially in the fight scenes a perfect example is a song nobody but me by the human beinz which is a really good song and they started playing it in the final fight scene and i was really getting into it because of that song then it just changed and threw me as the viewer completely offdont get me wrong this is not a bad film by any means the film has some very good parts in it my personal favorite was actually the animated sequence with the backstory of oren ishii it was extremely well animated in an anime type style and was very compelling it made me feel for the girl extremely not many films accomplish that from me nowadays and no its not because im a soulless monster its because a lot of films skip parts like this the parts that make you somewhat care for the characters im not saying i cared for the characters extremely in the movie but this scene obviously was there to strike a nerve in the viewer about the main antagonist of the film and before you come screaming to me no bill is the main antagonist im gonna say even though this movie is literally named the main antagonist is not bill in this film bill might be the higher up bad guy in this film but hes barely in it and there is no scene where uma thurmans character interacts with him on a face to face standpoint besides in flashbacks the real antagonist of the story in my opinion is oren ishii shes in the movie for basically over half of it and the movie literally ends after uma thurmans character the bride kills her i honestly enjoyed lucy lius performance in this movie as oren ishii i couldnt help to laugh at the scene were she cuts of the dudes head without hesitation and then becomes all sweet afterward to the remaining people in the room she gave me a sweet but extremely sinister feelone thing people have found out about the film was that tarantino had based a lot of it on the 1973 japanese film lady snowblood from director toshiya fujita which after watching the film for about 30 minutes i realized that the film had huge japanese influences from movies from their culture but also seemed to have a western feel at parts which surprisingly mixed wellprosshot compositionfilming techniques are very goodgreat cast especially uma thurman and lucy liuanimated sequence in the film was extremely well animated and compellinga great soundtrack even though songs were not played for longthe fight scenes choreographysome of the japanese influences were coolconsextremely random and inconsistent with the films story visual effects black and whiteunnecessary audio effectssong changes in scenes extremely frequently which kills the mood of the sceneat times the story is too linear for me to care about the characterssometimes the japanese influences were confusingthe film was extremely overhyped for me before i watched itend rating  4 out of 10,cruel
certainly isnt anything remarkable but it feels like unbridled tarantino with minimal backstory and unnecessary dialogue and lots of blood and action i like the segmentation of the plot and the premise is a fun one if a pretty standard revenge narrative some of the choreography in the action sequences is really impressive and a joy to watch and theres something to be said for watching a dominant heroine carrying the story its difficult to get invested between a simple uninventive revenge plot and no character development to give us reason to connect with and root for the bride all we know is that this group put her into a coma and she comes out aggressive and intent on revenge and we dont really get any other character traits beyond merciless determination even as the action was well choreographed of course tarantino added gratuitous and laughably inexplicable gore like arms being cut off and spraying blood like a sprinkler the ending while dramatically written lacked any tension as tarantinos use of nonlinearity was ineffective in showing crucial information early and then the climax is just providing detail of an event that we knew about i also am cautious of judging volume 1 too strongly as they were filmed and intended as one movie so the second will have a significant impact on how i view this one it was a fun action ride but didnt have a creative plot or any character development rendering the movie flat,cruel
i wish there will be a comic like this,cruel
minor spoilers is one of the classics from quentin tarantino honestly its a little overrated in my opinion its not a bad movie at all though i really enjoyed it feels like one of those style over substance movies not to say there isnt any substance there are some great character moments but not enough in a fast paced action movie there wasnt enough time to fully develop the brides characterthe action is absolutely amazing i mean there isnt much to say its just so good it can be silly at times but its shot very well with barely any shakey cam and tons of creative shots its definitely the best part of the film i cant praise the action enough the choreography is great and theres a ton of style to keep the action looking fresh theres an anime section in the movie which was beautiful and honestly my favorite part it sets up one of the orens character very well i thought her chemistry with the bride was great you really feel like they were friends and theres almost sadness when they fight what is so great about this film is how entertaining it is the pacing is great and it barley slows down theres so much memorable moments and its so quickly paced the movie feels like a breeze its one of those rare movies you could rewatch and not get tired of this isnt to say the film doesnt have any flaws i think it doesmy big issue with this movie is how silly convenient and unrealistic it can be obviously this isnt meant to be a realistic film but theres only so much disbelief i can suspend i mean she gets out of a populated hospital without being able to move her legs so shes dragging herself through the hospital all the way to the parking lot also the bride wins most of her fights because of luck theres 2 times where she was shot or a knife was thrown at her and they just happened to miss a character gets her arm chopped and she stays there for at least 10 minutes without any medical care and survives some how also youre telling me that everyone has swords instead of guns i mean if youre really trying to kill her get some guns the bride just does things that are humanly impossible and as far as i know shes a normal human also youre telling me that a public place gets attacked and the police never comes a person whos supposed to be in a coma ran away from the hospital killed some guys isnt being pursued by the police and is able to book tickets to fly to another country did she bring her weapons on the plane it just doesnt make sense theres only so much stuff i can ignore eventually it starts to annoy me also i have to mention that some of the sound editing isnt very good a lot of the sounds are clearly reused i mean they used the wilhelm scream twice im not saying every sound has to be different but it shouldnt be noticeablemy final problem with the movie is lack of character development we just barely know anything about the bride the beginning actually sets up the plot very well and very quickly and we dont really need to know much about her but she needs more character development and history i mean how does she know all these martial arts theres only 2 characters who are set up the bride and oren oren was literally shown in a flashback that anime sequence was seriously amazing thoughi do have to complement the film thought for being so violent and actually really dark the violence is just glorious the blood fountains are unrealistic but its so great to see the action is just amazing some of the best in all cinema the fight with the crazy 88 wow even the fist fights are great ripping through walls breaking everything grabbing furniture and throwing it at each other i do have to say the ending was underwhelming though theres also a ton of hidden dark themes in the film im sure they wanted to delve deeper into them but the mpaa ratings wouldnt allow it thats actually why some of the fights are in black and white or hidden i did wish they couldve delved more into the psyche of the charactersanyways in conclusion i think this is a very flawed movie its silly has a ton of plot convenience its hard to believe at times and theres barely any character development but i would be lying if i didnt enjoy this film the direction sound track fight choreography cinematography is just all amazing the movie never gets boring and youre always on the edge of your seat it also has some surprisingly dark moments and the violence is just glorious for the last time that anime sequence was amazing is a good but very flawed action movie710,cruel
12 october 2003 revised january 25 2019 this sometimes innovative sometimes daring sometimes amazing martial artsrevenge thriller comes off as a stylistic choreography of fighting complexity uma thurman though seems to escape death more by accident than by skill or talent the retroviolence is so much over the top that it becomes a reflection of the comicbook and graphic novel version japanese samurai movies the flashbacks and animations the emotional and cute comedic scenes are great how does uma thurman survive her first encounter and how does she accidentally find a weapon in the second encounter and then how does she really fend for herself in a somewhat less than brilliant sword fight in the third overall this was an amazing movie with great blending of some excellent flourishes for old movies with a consistently prominent soundtrack to heighten the whole independent cult film feel but it misses the perfection mark by a few notches eight out of ten stars,cruel
commits the cardinal sin of giving the audience only a half baked story and it hurts the film throughout i got the sense that tarantino thinks he is being more clever than he actually is this is easily the worst of tarantinos four features the other three being reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown at this point its difficult to tell whether the story as a whole is worth telling  that judgment will have to await the release of volume 2 but based on whats available for the time being i can only recommend for diehard tarantino buffs and hong kong action junkies everyone else would do better to stay away and avoid the bitter disappointment of seeing how the greed of a distributor can degrade the moviegoing experience the action scenes are as expected exciting but the dialoguetarantinos strong trait arent much to sneeze at,cruel
i love qt films pulp fiction is fabulous and i thought jackie brown was possibly better how to improve on perfection even d2d kept me entertainedbut this one sorry but i dont get iti am not a talented award winning director so its almost certainly something that is wrong with me but i am surprised that qt is behind this presentation i expected better,cruel
is boring in 1997 when pulp fiction came out it changed cinema and rightly won best original screenplay at the oscars what people forget is a dude called roger wrote it with him and he won an oscar as well tarantino has never bettered pulp fiction and never will his films will always have weinstein attached to them making violent films is your thing oliver stone turned natural born killers into a masterpiece and the late tony scott made true romance a cult classic make something special tarantino as your filmography aint that great,cruel
i think its the worst movie for quentin tarantino it is true that its a very special film with a special environment and violent scenes as we used it with tarantino but this film cannot be compared to other movies like the reservoir dogs or pulp fiction or the hateful eight etci am almost certain that tarantino during his various works he tried to gather all the worlds experiments in his films such as his film inglourious basterds where he made his way out of history and in this movie he moved to history of asia to the fighting industry with his violent perspective of the cinemagenerally the film its ok but its not interesting tarantino failed here i think so,cruel
i apologize to every other movie that ive ever rated as 1 no other movie belongs in the category of this one the worst stupidest movie ever,cruel
yes im a huge fan of quentin tarantino but deservingly soaside from his visionary directing and writing he has a knack for casting his films to perfection uma thurman david carradine daryl hannah and michael madsen where excellent choices for their respective rolesshout outs also to the visual and editing departments for an outstanding end resultso its a 1010 from me for yet another quentin tarantino hit,cruel
nothing in is original and this is wonderful we have italian and french horror chinese kung fu movies japanese cinema trash and even western movies besides we have at least 15 films referenced here among them thriller a cruel picture the chinese dragon and especially lady snowblood and even ghost in the shell that is we have a film about movies bringing a aesthetics and incredible direction and a unique soundtrack the script even has its surprises but is very common in its essence it brings a history of revenge with typical endings of mexican novels but the legal one here is not the script that tells the history of the bride who was dead in its marriage and which now seeks revenge but the way it is told mixing narrative lines and in this volume 1 we do not have the beginning or the end we only have the medium with little backgrounds we do not have a moral treated in the movie and if we had it it would be cut in half spouting 27 liters of blood in a stylized way playing the only music possible to give perfection to the moment the high point of the film besides the references that tarantino used to compose his work references that create scenes and makes a movie of scenes and therefore his separation in chapters is perfect tarantino plays with the camera makes plans spectacular sequences makes 360  plays shadows leaves the screen in pb changes the photograph changes the graphics uses against light does against plonge and plonge it makes such a great mixture of techniques that in the end we have a style completely is an unimaginable movie because all these features are used because they are inspired by several completely different films among themselves in addition to their optimum sound mix and an amazing assemblagethe scene setting of the arrival of the bride to japan is incomparable  and all this gives a rhythm and dynamism in the movie that makes the 2 hours look like 15 minutes and make the viewer beg for more and of course we can not fail to mention his magnificent soundtrack where we have from bernad hermann to ennio morricone to nancy sinatra the music is a character in the film because she is always there present and screaming besides participating the rhythm of the long characters and interact with the action in addition to being wonderful has one of the best movie soundtracks for me even if not original we do not have major highlights in this first volume but even so uma thurman is fine and holds the role tarantino abuses all his expertise in various areas of the film in this film and proves that film is learned is watching film finally is a movie that many many will hate find it coarse or even silly but its beauty is intrinsic to the eyes of moviegoers and moviegoers and even those looking for something different revenge is a dish that is eaten cold  old klingon proverb,cruel
this is the movie he made after jackie brown i thought i might just point that out a big budget larger scale action blockbuster this is the one that would change the direction of tarantinos films and honestly it might be my favorite besides pulp fictionthis movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action this movie has an anime section akin to japanese anime thats some cool stuff even the nonaction parts are some really good stuff like the guy from the old street fighter movies as hatori hanzo and making the brides sword and the fantastic soundtrack the great opening scene where the bride gets shot and then the somber bang bang by nancy sinatra playsbut of course the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie a lot of it is showcased in the crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it it has some brilliant uses of the style of course theres black and white which was actually used to avoid an nc17 but works very effectively and the beautifully shot battle between the bride and oren no music really adds a lot to it its quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the crazy 88but theres also the opening hand to hand fight scene with vernita green which is also very well edited very surprising scene as it is interrupted by greens daughter coming home and then they talk and it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to vernitas chest what a brilliant tension filled scenethe movie also never takes itself too seriously thats for the sequel but the fun action and style leads the whole way also along with buck and other fun scenes lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as elle driver comes to kill the bride in her sleep or interrogating sophie these will be things you will miss i love ithonestly it might be the best action movie of the 2000s at least for me and tarantino has a lot of my favorite movies maybe i enjoy his movies a bit too much but even with that its one of the my favorites vol 1 gets a 1010,cruel
is the fourth entry film from the writerdirector quentin tarantino as for a fan of anime or any japanese related chattels this film illustrates these themes thoroughly this film is radically popular for its hardcore bloody violence that seems as a disturbance for the foretime but diverts into a huge laughter for its over the top bloody violence its passably aware that this violence arent realistic and a positive is it knows not only does this film make for an enjoyable blood ride it makes up for a distinctive action flickfollows a tale of the bride uma thurman who was ruthlessly violated harmed and shot in the head by a bullet from a gun her baby was vigorously removed from her unconsciousness after 4 years of coma she wakes up to seek revenge to all the relatives of bill her former husband surrounding an outright of five criminals additionally this plot synopsis may seem undoubtedly familiar as it semblances same cycles from its genre however the direction that was prevailed made a frequent revenge plot very different and alarming it is separated into two volumes as it is detailed into casual plot points and uncommonly wellwritten in order to give sympathy for our main heros success and an intimacy for all the personage it could be regarded as a pop culture action flick as it has one of the best movie scores that is very commonly and popularly used in most of all action flicks the bride sets off a journey to these two enemies oren ishii lucy liu and vernita green vivica a fox who were one of the violators of the five and have a clear relationship with bill as weve come to expect in a tarantino film there is doubtlessly over the top violence with supreme blood it may lead the audiences incredibly disturbed but as the film lunges it makes us laugh with uttermost laughter for all the bloody violence and gore it may leave us a feel of oddity and bizarreness and the outcome of being sickened by the absurdness but it is truly selfaware of its absurdity and extraordinary in addition this film has a major appreciation towards japanese culture especially its location and a strong usage of anime tarantino uses the location very energetically in japan at a temple like a mansion action films nowadays tend to use shaky cam to intensify its tension and hide poor stunt coordinates in the other hand this film is the complete diverse of these camera industries it has a sense of steadiness so we can observe all the action that is proceeding in the scenes instead of shakiness sometimes it has a taste of fast cuts and edits in some sections but handles this professionally plus the movie contains one of the best duel scenes with only japanese swords with the bride and the crazy 88s it is a jawdroppingly remarkable sequence that never tries to hinder robert richardson uses the cinematography immaculate with saturated colors and a taste of archaism uma thurman is terrific as the bride progressively and is splendid to a harmed female character that may empower female roles in movies overall is a very different film compared to mainstream action flicks these days it may be controversial but the action sequences are filmed marvelously containing tons of bloody violence that may not be for everyone however one cannot deny the fact it is immensely entertaining and riveting to watch as a standard action flick and a lighthearted dramatic film grade a,cruel
its no wonder i fell hard for uma thurman when first hit the scene the camera is extremely flattering and her sex appeal fits very well in the exploitation film moldto me vol 1 is tarantino at his most watchable the scrambled narrative eclectic soundtrack and excessive violence all work together with unparalleled harmony the characters are as colorful as the palette but it all really comes down to the revenge angle and this movies got it everywhere it counts the bride is wronged in the worst way and her fury is surprisingly satisfying wasnt sure this would hold up but it does exceedingly well between the bloodsprays and the fight scenes theres an electrical charge coursing through all of this that final showdown at the house of blue leaves is insane i used to think that vol 2 had a leg up with the character development but its hard to compete with something this exciting910,cruel
this is in itself probably my least favorite tarantino movie in my opinion is one movie and i dont think the stand alone version is so great this movie have a scene that is partly in black and white and it have parts that is from the part 2 which disturb me because i love to see part one and part 2 after each otherbut i have find the version that is perfect for me the whole bloody affaireven if you want to see as separate films i recommend you to check this out because it have an expended anime montage and an in my opinion better version in color of the fight against the crazy 88 i recommend  fmoviescom were you dont even have to download it or signing in for you who cant find it on blue ray or dvd dont want to buy itthe whole bloody affair is highly rated but get way to less votes to arrive to the top 250 list i think this movie deserve to be there and thats why i write this review,cruel
volume 1 of tarantinos famous revenge story is an absolute joy for film loversthe homages to 70s samurai flicks spaghettiwestern and trashy exploitation cinema are great and many but the movie always stays focused and feels like his own thing rather than a carbon copy of anythingthe cinematography is as amazing as it gets i think there is not a single shot in this film which dont look amazing the lighting is very artistic and complex the visual ideas interesting and every scene feels different and has another clever idea how to be the most effective visualization of a situationthe script is amazing simple setup like the movies it homages but the dialogue is brilliant and fun to listen to so that it never get s boringspeaking of never getting boring the action in this film is incredible but used sparingly and never overstays its welcome and its gory as hell but thats suspected from a tarantinoflick but how the blood waves explode out of the bodies is an obvious homage to the old samurai flicks like the ones from kurosawathe soundtrack is strange and a wild mix from many other films also like expected but its as strange that it works so wellthe actors all do a great job especially uma thurman who i just knew from completely different movies where i loved her performances already even if the movie was crap batman and robin my super exgirlfriend everyone else also get pushed from the director to give the most fitting performance they couldthis is my favourite tarantinoflick alongside the hateful eight and jackie brown,cruel

quentin tarantino doesnt disappoint in this cinema masterpiece makes me very nostalgicof kung fu theaterfrom my childhoodthe story doesnt leave you wondering the whys and whats in the story without answering that questionas soon as you ask yourselfin addition to paying homage to bruce lee in the third act the the bride dishes karma to bills henchmen in the best she knows how in addition to reconnecting with her humanity through acts of archaic training preparing her for the confrontation of the person that spearheaded her inner conflict  top tier story telling take notes everyone,cruel
love that the films title basically tells you what youre in forthrough present day and flashback we are told why this woman is after bill who bill is and how she has trained herself to undergo this questits use of color editing location and musicall utilized perfectlyare embedded into the films dnatarantinos means of getting us there is hard to turn away from the film is bold painful uncomfortable stylish and fun all at the same timethe end result is that qt uses his large bag of tricks to strengthen our resolve at seeing this through to the endthis film actually delivers on the trailer,cruel
this review will be by chapterchapter 1 does a solid job of laying out the framework for the rest of the film the fighting was both creative and smooth also the dialog is nothing short of tarantinos typical conversationschapter 2 can be disturbing but that only helps the viewer emphasize with the bride and the horrors she faced so well done chapter 2chapter 3 the odd one out chapter due to it being animated rather then live action like the rest of the film this chapter is a backstory on another character not that you need to see it to understand the rest of the film no joke you can skip this part and be just fine this chapter also suffers from a small plot hole involving escaping what seems like an inescapable situationchapter 4 this chapter is the least action packed out of the five bearing 0 fighting and all dialog thankfully the dialog is clever and does not drag on also the exchange between english and japanese and back to english felt smooth and not random which is something that sounds impossible but has now been proved to not bechapter 5 wow what a finale this chapter is the most action packed and man is the action sweet it is extremely varied with many uses of furniture quips of clever dialog and all the glorious and also not disturbing gore910 not a 1010 because of chapter 3 being pure filler,cruel
i was reminded once again throughout watching this movie of tarantinos apparent foot fetish like all his other pictures with those closeup perversions ill be like say what no matter it only seems like his idiosyncrasies only serve proof to his leaps of genius towards his allstyle approach but he is more than that at the same time when those scenes happen very few luckily i was reminded yet another thing that tarantino confidently strikes away the convention that most movies seem to have to choose between action or ideas style or substance it is rare for a great movie to do both but its even rarer that a great movie can balance it with clarity and equilibrium that elevates a great movie to a masterpiece take for example of those brief scenes where the bride sees in viewing distance of her target for vengeance after a quick cut into an overshadow flashback with urgent sounds of the importance and the actions of that target in the past this is an action flick after all and the general audience doesnt want to waste time with stagnant regurgitated exposition dialogue to sacrifice the pacing and momentum of the films kinetic rhythm tarantino respects the audience and hence respects their intelligence for films this intelligence is matched by the man himself theres without question that he loves and knows the movies and he exuberantly indulgences those classical homages and tropes as a celebration of the medium but it always comes second to his classic tarantino flavour style we always get a sense of his auteur his personal creative vision that hes willing to transcend those references into something new and true and thats the heart of where lies in just like so many of his other films every scene sequence is so meticulously crafted with a sense of purpose and relevance the story and plot while at the same time being polished to look as vintage as the brides pussy wagon vehicle to give a childlike curiosity and enthusiasm for the movieslovers to say hey i know this reference and where it comes from heres another example of how tarantino loves to toy with the audience through creating and alternating subversive film expectations the climax scene of the movie where the bride fights off the yakuza bodyguards at the restaurant notice how in the first sequence bride is only fighting one opponent at the time in a gauntletlike fashion theres absolutely no sense of logic in that why not have all of them fight her at the same time which unsurprisingly is found in most action flicks but tarantino makes us waitonly to spectacularly unleash us the remaining army soon afterwards with a proper sense of logic and purpose tarantino isnt afraid to indulge in experimenting a multitude of styles in respects to the japanese setting of the movie such as an anime inspired sequence of orens backstory an origin so violent and hyperstylised that its almost a disservice if it was live action as it would dampen its aesthetic appeal while the previously mentioned fighting climax scene at the restaurant incorporates a blackand white photography and blue silhouette in order to maximise the rule of cool formula but its simply because it had to get pass the censors unfortunately above all a tarantino movie wouldnt be a tarantino movie without the use of nonlinear narrative he uses it to great effect in the beginning with the circular narrative going forwards and backwards to add a human element to the bride her motivations and a reason why we want to see the revenge part from the revenge flick in the first place im sure actual revenge in real life is wrong itself if we disregard the argument of genre preferences sometimes it is how the movie is about and not what its about as said before he doesnt forget the story because he believes an action sequences work better in the service of and around the plot not the other way otherwise having it backwards gives the illusion of fight scenes as stiff and scripted its not a coincidence theres chapter titles within the film in the first placein worst case scenario tarantinos over indulgence mightve been too apparent and the story and structure wouldve been nothing more than a technical exercise remember even with most action movies theres more minutes spent on the nonaction scenes than the actual action scenes hence the pacing and effect of the action scenes would be more effective if it had a coherent context in the first place ironically tarantinos greatest achievement from this movie is making us forget about this in the first place that is the sensation he creates isnt that why we go to a movie in a first place,cruel
this is a great example of how emotional appeal allows us to root for a character the brides murders and mutilations while they are rather gruesome and cruel are more acceptable to us as an audience because of her desire for vengeance but in some ways you might be able to flip the story around and make the bride the villain and have the protagonist be oren it could almost be an origin story for some kind of last student of orens dojo that goes after the bride ten years later or something in an attempt to reinstate the order to its former glory or something like that it might not turn out as good but its interesting to think aboutof the tarantino movies ive seen django pulp hateful 8 resivoir this is the easiest to follow next to django which in some ways make it the least interesting to watch however that does not keep it from being an entertaining experience with the constant soundtrack artsy style and way overthetop fight scenes if you want to study tarantino for screen writing you can probably skip this one even though there is some good voiceover and flashback use but if you want to be a director or dp you have to see this for educational purposeseven by todays standards this is a pretty amazing action movie now we have some grander scale and more visually impressive action movies like avengers or kingsmen but this is still quite a different action movie experience even if its novelty has worn off some in the past decade some of the fight scenes are actually funny with their implausible decapitations in some ways you want to sympathize with the brides victims but you dont really have time to however its visual appeal comes through more than just action as it gives us an animestyle flashback scene exposing the childhood of oren also the shot in which the bride picks up the samurai sword was so powerful that i could almost feel it in my handsthere is some controversy over the excessive brutality shown throughout i wouldnt say this should automatically deter you from watching it but if seeing a lot of blood makes you sick then by all means find something else how you interpret the portrayal of violence is your deal and hopefully it works for you but i dont think its fair to say that tarantino is a sick person for making extremely bloody films for all we know hes doing it to reduce the violence in the world rather than to promote itif you like tarantinos directing style youll like this but it might be a bit disappointing if youre more interested in his narrative style its great if youre looking for an action flick but not if you want an intriguing story if youre unsure watch a couple of chapters and then reevaluate just dont expect it to be an emotional experience overall rating 7610,cruel
vol 1 back in partnership with quentin tarantino and uma thurman and the film is super violent the plot of the film is good  the cast is great  the acting is good  mainly from thurman  the film s makeup is perfect  the action scenes are very good and bloody  see legs arms and severed heads are very well made  the scene the bride fight against the japanese is great  its a lot of blood on the scene the rhythm is good the movie is not long and the direction of tarantino is great  the soundtrack is very good i found the film very exaggerated  if cuts a finger out 2 liters of blood taking over this is a great movie  note 88,cruel
this is a timeless movie in the sense that director quentin tarantino is like a lyrebird drawing from sources covering different eras in pop culture the introductory credits reek of 1970s asian martial arts movies in fact the movie seems to represent itself as being the product of such a company and text on the screen stating that revenge is a dish best served cold is attributed to an old klingon proverbsoon we see what looks like the final moments of a battered bride just before she is about to be murdered for some mysterious reason by a gang of unknown thugs early on in the film we can hear nancy sinatra sing bang bang my baby shot me down having just searched that song i see that it was initially a song recorded by cher and nancy sinatra covered it in the same year tarantinos pop cultural references here are both apt and illustrative of his eclectic approach and borrowing anyway uma thurmans the bride is not one for dying and we soon embark on her backstory and thirst for revenge i say the bride as her name is not revealed to the viewer in this movie its odd hearing her name bleeped out when it is mentioned by characters my attempt at lip reading made me think that her name was patriciapresented in chapters the movie has the bride seek all those that would have killed her in order to return the favour to thembut this time more successfully as per the title of the movie bill is the one that the bride must ultimately confrontanother way that the movie is a fragmented collage is demonstrated when an asian sounding man takes on the narrating duties for a short stint who on earth is he mixing up the temporal sequenceinformation like this is one way that tarantino get the viewer to ask questions like mine that character sounds like he says engrish at one point in time and english just a few seconds later the order of the movies chapters isnt even chronologicalwhen the bride has visited the first thug the viewer sees we later see her cross that name off her listbut another name has already been crossed off her listand we did not see that confrontation with the bride also intriguingly one hears the bride using the phrase does onea peculiarly english toffee figure of of speech the bride also flits between referencing shakespeare and star trekfrom eyebrow culture as kath  kim would say to lowbrow culturepatently playful tarantino indulges in a backstory for one of the thugs that the bride is pursuing that backstory makes use of the cartoon form to inform the viewer instead of live action flashback other times the bride seems to have access to her wouldbe killers personal histories which she should not have perhaps it seems to me that tarantino also has the bride walk past an actual poster of uma thurman at a tokyo airport im assuming that uma actually did paid work for that poster before the movie was ever conceivedsince this movie is volume 1 its not spoiler to say that by the end of this movie the bride has crossed some names off her list the end credits are also interesting to read too theres an rip charles bronson as well as the more mysterious dustbusting david geoghegan huh perhaps most interestingly the actor sonny chiba who plays hattori hanzo in the movie is later credited with being the movies samurai sword adviser maybe im a bit reticent but i suspect that the credit stating that the character of the bride was created by q  u refers to quentin and umabut i havent bothered verify that some puzzles for me when the bride wakes from her coma she looks at the lines on her palmwhats the signficance of that theres also something weird going on when the perspective on a sniper shot seems to changeif youre watching this movie on video maybe check out what the bride has written on the soles of her shoes its near the end of the movie where there is a glass floor in a restaurant,cruel
review of vol 1 and vol 2brilliant moviesa young woman is shot and left for dead at her wedding her entire wedding party is massacred in cold blood after four years in a coma she awakes and systematically sets out to wreak revenge on the people responsible especially their leader billfantastic movie in two parts written and directed by quentin tarantino solid original plot good character depth cool dialogue as you would expect from tarantino good action scenes good use too of timejumps a tarantino trademarkgood performances tooof the two movies i preferred vol 2 to vol 1 though there is not much in it  vol 2 is a 10 vol 1 a 9 vol 1 was more about action with a massive fight scene towards the end it had plot but was more the start of a plot with many loose threadsvol 2 had plot development and character development and was less about action though there was still enough of it thus more substance in vol 2 more style in vol 1 and substance beats style,cruel
the 4th film by quentin tarantino arrived in two volumes and of all the films that this auteur has made in his filmmaking career vol 1 remains his most precise blend of riveting story fascinating characters pop culture references wonderful homages  gripping action all of which is seamlessly brought together by just the ideal incorporation of existing music to deliver an immensely enjoyable wildly entertaining  thoroughly fulfilling cinematic experiencebased on the character of the bride created by q  u as in quentin  uma vol 1 follows a former member of the deadly viper assassination squad who while pregnant  about to marry is brutally assaulted by her allies and falls into a comatose state waking up after 4 years  discovering that the baby in her womb is gone this deadly assassin goes on a killing rampage to unleash vengeance upon the five people who destroyed her life  killed her childwritten  directed by quentin tarantino is his homage to numerous film genres like spaghetti westerns kung fu flicks chinese wuxia japanese samurai cinema  even anime and vol1 is simply a revenge bloodbath the entire picture is expertly narrated from start to finish makes excellent use of all his trademarks and is jampacked with compelling characters each gifted with a distinct quality from the beginning to the end vol 1 is one bloody affair that comes loaded with both style  substancevol 1 is covered in five chapters each strong enough to stand on its own and is engaging from the first frame to the last a particular highlight is the anime sequence which provides the backstory of a prominent character and just about everything in it is perfectly executed the set pieces are in accordance with the location where its plot is unfolding even camera is exquisitely employed and makes splendid use of long takes silhouette shots greyscale photography different angles  wide ranging colour tonesthe action is highly stylised brilliantly choreographed  goes totally bonkers in the blood splattered sequence before the final showdown and is incredibly fun  amusing to look at editing splits the plot into five segments which is then narrated in nonchronological order yet the transition from one chapter to another is absolutely smooth and finally there is the use of existing music to drive its story as well as viewers emotions and in my opinion its the best set of tracks tarantino has put together plus it just workscoming to the performances vol 1 features a terrific cast in uma thurman lucy liu julie dreyfus sonny chiba chiaki kuriyama vivica a fox  others in addition to brief appearances from characters that are dealt with in vol 2 leading from the front is thurman as the bride and it still remains her careerdefining work for shes electrifying charismatic  flamboyant in the given role liu plays oren ishii the first on brides revenge list and chips in with fantastic performance while kuriyama easily steals every moment shes present inon an overall scale vol 1 is the most harmonious blend of tarantinos filmmaking trademarks and is a cinema that works on all levels although it only covers the first half of the brides bloodsoaked revenge saga it effectively paves the groundwork for the next in line and succeeds as a standalone movie too there isnt really much to complain about it for even its overthetop action  exaggerated bloodfilled violence only end up working in its favour and the film as a whole is a pure exemplification of a cinephiles own enthusiasm passion  love for the cinematic medium one hundred percent recommended,cruel
this marks the beginning of tarantinos shift from crime to revenge is a lot of things funny corny emotional actionpacked colorful avantgarde its very indulgent and provocative from the gory action scenes to even dedicating a 15 minute portion of it as an animated comicbook backstory for one of the characters it definitely takes on provocative subjectsuma thurman gives an amazing performance beautiful and tough as steel its not as high iq as tarantinos previous films but when you have an assassin frantically taking on 20 ninjas in a chinese restaurant with the 5678s singing the woo hoo song youre having too much fun to care how silly the story is,cruel
volume 1 2003 dir quentin tarantino  cast uma thurman lucy liu vivica a fox sonny chiba julie dreyfus exhilarating action film about revenge in its most determined state uma thurman plays the bride who is left for dead by the assassins she worked for she awakens from a four year coma and trains herself to avenge the death of her unborn child and the betrayal extremely graphic with stylish direction by quentin tarantino who is quoting from various genres this adds to pulp fiction and jackie brown among his grand achievements thurman is fantastic handling the sword play with skill and grace but ultimately out for blood vivica a fox plays an assassin with different priorities she now lives in a suburban neighborhood as a mother which complicates the emotions of viewers particularly when the daughter arrives home to witness her mothers mistake lucy liu is a great presence whose power in tokyo is highlighted by animation involving the murder of her father she is fronted by the crazy 88s bodyguards as well as the reality that she must face consequences sonny chiba plays a sword craftsman who vowed never to make another sword until thurman mentions that one name bill julie dreyfus plays lius lawyer who pays a lethal price for her association brilliantly crafted and demonstrates the fueling ugliness of revenge score 8  10,cruel
i have been watching tarantinos films in chronological order by release date in preparation for the hateful eight after the intricate drama which was jackie brown tarantino returns to the use of violence with vol 1 and he adds so much more violence to the film than any of his previous 3 we have vol 1 using violence as a spectacle in many ways especially in the climactic chapter of the filmlike jackie brown tarantino decides to go with a female protagonist to portray the powerful woman in modern society feminism is a large motif in the first part of the whole bloody affair yes the bride fights men in this film but the films main antagonists are strong women who have worked alongside the bride in the past the battles are no longer fought by men guys the women in this film put men in their place as they are intelligent maniacal but above all simply badaeswhereas reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown were more intelligent films this one is probably one of the most fun tarantino movies to watch it also has a simple premisemotivation which we have seen often before revenge but revenge has never been done quite like this the blood effects in this film are ridiculous beyond any form of rationality making certain deaths gruesome but at the same time somewhat pleasing in a twisted fashion not only is anime employed to highlight the background of lucy lius character  tarantino gets away with huge uses of blood in a more appropriate manner than if he were to form these scenes as live action segments it also adds to the idea that the movie is supposed to be fun and cartoonishwhereas i have discussed that tarantino uses dialogue in his first three films to build characters there is not much interesting dialogue in this film as much as narrations by the bride but this film doesnt seem to need the witty clever dialogue we are so used to in quentin tarantino filmswith an astounding cliffhanger of an ending this film makes you crave for more as the credits roll this is a fun piece of feminist film to say the least even if the film is desperate for flashbacks and narration at certain moments3540,cruel
for me was the movie that put quentin tarantino on the top of my list for favorite directors of all time i mean this movie has it all a brutal revenge story perfectly choreographed fight sequences and lots of blood the movie literally starts out with a bang and from that point you know your in for a treat the movie starts out with a great fight sequence that shocks you just 10 minutes into the movie from there tarantino effectively uses his nonlinear storytelling to piece together the brides back story and helps provide a reason for her motives the flashbacks help establish the bride as an excellent main character who really connects with the audience on an emotional level once the story returns back to the present the audience feels such a connection with the bride that they feel compelled to root for her as she hunts down each of her adversaries but a hero is only as good as its villain and luckily tarantino doesnt forget to include a formidable and equally dangerous villain the main villain even gets her own back story leading up to the climax of the film which also ends with bang however vol 1 does suffer from a few problems the pacing of the movie seems uneven at times as it spends so much time in the past explaining backstory that you get the feeling that by the end of the movie the bride really hasnt done much also in typical tarantino fashion the movie does contain a number of scenes that sometimes proved to be a little too weird for my taste but hey thats just his stylevol 1 has it anything and everything you could expect from a tarantino style samurai movie looking past the few flaws of this movie the viewer really gets to see the raw talent of quentin tarantino,cruel
the story of revolves around the female character kiddo played by uma thurman the film starts off with the main character kiddo waking up in a hospital the viewer can deduce that she has been in a coma for a long period of time the theme of the story is the vengeance ans cruelty of mankind that is the focal point of kiddos existence at this point and she sets out to avenge herself and her unborn baby she creates a list of people she knows were involved in her unborn babys death her main goal is to find and kill a man named bill played by david carradine her first agenda is henchmen the assassins that tried to murder her at her own wedding in this film kiddo confronts two of the assassins vernita green and oren ishii played by vivica a fox and lucy lui respectivelyit is a unique film in that the story is broken up into 2 parts and both i and ii were created together tarantino created this film as a tribute to the classic seventies kungfu style films the imagery and art direction are beautiful and have that cheesy style seventies look this film is over the top and exaggerated but it was what tarantino was going for every character in the film is extremely violent aggressive and cruel with a dark and violent past this was tarantinos commentary on the state of the world today he is not so much promoting violence but showing the viewer that violence and aggressive behavior is in all of human kind one only needs to be part of the under belly of society for the aggressiveness to be let out for example a scene about the character gogo yubari played by chiaki kuriyama shows a sweet innocent girl who witnesses the brutal murder of her parents from this point she evolves from her innocent stage into a coldblood assassin who seems to have no conscientiousness at allthe homage to the classic martial arts films of the seventies can be seen throughout the film one amazing scene in which a sword fight is played out in silhouette shows tarantinos artistic style and one feels almost as if he is watching bruce lee in action another amazing scene is the sword fight between kiddo and oren ishii the setting is beautiful with a snowcovered landscape this battle is a direct recreation of the classic martial arts films also has some memorable standoff scenes similar to the classic standoff scene in the good the bad and the ugly and the remarkable standoff scene in another of tarantinos films reservoir dogsalthough the film is an ultra violent gore fest using gallons of blood it is more of tarantinos warning to humanity if we allow the sadistic vengeful side of ourselves to be released our life will be consumed with hate and a never ending need for revenge against those we feel have wronged us it is a reminder to all of us that w have the ability to become like any one of his characters if we are not careful with our thoughts and behaviors,cruel
is one of the most clever films i have seen and the film is what you would expect from quentin tarantinodraws a lot of inspiration from classic western motion pictures and japanese films as well quentin shows why he is considered one of the greatest directors ever and writers as welland the film just shows how you are suppose to make a hit film in the new generation everything about this film is worth your time the plot of the film centers on the bride played by uma thurman as she awakes from a four year coma thanks a team of assassins lead by bill played by david carradine she begins her quest for revenge for her unborn child and herself as she hunts down each one of the assassins who destroy her life oren ishii played by lucy liu vernita green played by vivica afox elle driver played by daryl hannah and budd played by michael madsenthe film shows how revenge is a dish best served cold and how the old saying is true that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned because the bride is armed with a samurai sword that she gain from hattori hanzo played by shinichi chibathe film just does a super job with telling a great story with top notch taunts and awesome action scenes quentin tarantino is one of those directors he could touch stones and make them gold and thats exactly what is a golden masterpiece for martial arts motion picturesthe acting is very well done as the cast perform to the best of their talents with quentin tarantino giving them great direction on how to bring their characters to lifethe music is what you should have in any movie as each music piece helps tell the story of and original songs for the film like battle without honor or humanity is the clear theme of the filmeverything is just very well done in the settings are very good and the fight scenes are well thought out and well timeif you want a classic film that has superb action stunts and well match story then vol1 is for youi give vol1 an 8 out of 10,cruel
this movie is the story of the bride played by uma thurman and her quest for revenge against the deadly viper assassination squad dvas the dvas consists of bill played by david carradine oren ishii played by lucy liu elle driver played by daryl hannah bud played by michael madsen and vernita green played by vivica a fox the reason that the bride is seeking revenge plays out in the opening scene of the movie when during her wedding rehearsal the bride and the entire wedding party are gunned down in cold blood even though she is left for dead we quickly find out that the bride has survived but she is now in a coma the main theme of this movie is the quest for vengeance the bride as well as every other member of the dvas seeks vengeance for some wrong done to them at one point or another throughout the movie as the main character the brides quest for vengeance is well established throughout the film in addition to her revenge there are many scenes which help to enforce that belief in the brides ability to exact that revenge to help reinforce both the necessity of the brides quest as well as her ability to complete it tarantino uses many different techniques throughout the film tarantino uses his tried and true nonlinear storytelling method which helps to establish both motive and ability the flashback scenes most often done in black and white give a great sense of past events that have shaped where the movie is heading in addition to black and white tarantino uses animation to help establish other characters motives tarantino is also masterful with his use of music the music through this film helps to set the mood of each scene perfectly from intense ominous music when action scenes are impending to more reserved revelatory music when milestones in the brides quest have been achieved the music that was used in the movie was spot on for anyone that is a fan of crime fiction as well as action movies this is a movie i would highly recommend this movie is a great example of a persons quest for revenge and the lengths that they will go to in order to achieve it obviously in order to get to the end of the story i would highly recommend watching volume 2 after volume 1 in order to get the entire story as tarantino intended it to be,cruel
for those of you who have not yet seen this film i must say that id recommend quentins other films over it pulp fiction and reservoir dogs i feel are superior pictures but thats not to say theres nothing in to see if youve already seen quentins other films and love every second of it is very much in the same ballpark its even the same league its even the same sport for those of you who dont like his other films dont bother with because its unlikely to tip you into favouring itnow that the shortest part of the review is over we can move onto the meat of the review i could give you a brief summary of the plot but i feel like writing any single bit of it down would almost spoil the movie because its not really in chronological order instead ill talk about a few aspects of it i like first and foremost the lead character yes the yellow suit and sword have become quite iconic over the years and for good reason shes oddly believable in a world full of unbelievable things this is perhaps the biggest joy of its full of all these sort of real characters who do unbelievable things and somehow marries the two things into a seamless whole that somehow crushes ones suspension of disbelief though quentin does seem to jump and try to snap that cord in half as he tight walks his way across it it took me until vol 2 to think about how silly some of the things happening were but i let it slide because at that point i knew that i wasnt supposed to be bogged down by realism this film is meant to be full of ridiculous gore thats one thing you simply have to understand if you watch whether you can detect it or not in the film is crucial to your reception normally i leave people to make their own interpretation of why something is in a film but in its so pivotal that i cant emphasize it strongly enough there are too many reviews and opinions about that all hinge on the insanity of the violencetheres a reason for this kind of blood spurting out in five feet high geysers this entire film is very much a mocking of how we glorify violence but its also about honour codes and to get both of these across it draws in references to all kinds of older films particularly kungfu and samurai films as well as that with the samurai sword that the bride makes so much use of theres a clear indication of the honour code as the japanese lords were famous for their zealous following of this code furthermore vol 2 draws in chinese honour beliefs also very strict and wellknown theres even undercurrents of more western honours with of course the brides heritage as american but also the soundtracks prominent use of trumpets bringing to my mind fond memories of the infamous shootouts so often captured in sergio leones films who i very much adore as a filmmaker now the glorification of violence comes in with the hugely fascinating usage of blood and gore in the film its so ridiculously over the top that it becomes almost funny and yet its still death and that is perhaps the idea death is death and no matter how you look at it its not going to be funny in the end as demonstrated by the second film but i wont spoil that just yet however its very close because theres not a lot more i can talk about with spoiling the film in some regard or at least in my opinion so if you want to jump to the end to read my usual closing statements feel free to do so now alternatively if youve already seen the film or dont care about plot though i think one should endeavour to have surprises in films then read onis about revenge specifically the revenge of beatrix beatrix is the aforementioned bride shes a former member of an exceptionally well trained group of female assassins lead by a mysterious bill however we learn that she has tried to leave this behind to marry another man and raise her child conceived with bill outside of the world of murder and violence this is perhaps what redeems beatrix for us shes a considerate mother and yet a deadly killer if it hadnt been for quentin tarantinos brilliant structuring of the film it would have been very difficult for us to like beatrix all of this stuff is learned piece by piece as the film goes on never enough for our appetites for answers to be sated fully but neither too little so that we lose interest in the film and track other prey instead he hits the perfect balance in that respect very much like he does in many of his other filmsthere is one small issue i have with quentin tarantinos pacing of the film the crazy 88s fight which is about as fantastic of a finale as you could possibly get with blood absolutely everywhere nearly a hundred amateur samurai up against lone beatrix and crazy moves galore this is how the second film should have ended but after this fight the second film never reaches that same peak this somewhat spoils my opinion of the second film but i stand by the belief that they both have to be watched even though the first film is definitely superior,cruel
the movie is essentially a story of revenge of a bride referred to as the black mambaplayed by uma thurman a church full of wedding guests is turned into a slaughterhouse by a gang of international assassins a bullet is put through the mambas head but unfortunately for them that only puts her into coma four years later the bride wakes up and realizes that her fianc her friends and the child in her womb have been killed she then embarks on a journey to seek revenge against the people who betrayed her she first goes to hatori hanzo and convinces him to make the famous sword depicted in the movie posters having armed herself she goes on about killing the gang members one by one and saves bill for the last her journey is full of action and not easy but one enjoys the adamant attitude of the lead character as she fights her way through various challenges quentin tarantino is a genius director and need no certification the monochrome shots are perfectly placed and give a classic look to the film the closeup shots and direct narration used in the movie lend an altogether different feel to the movie one sequence which stands out from the rest is the depiction of oren ishiis revenge the whole sequence is an anime flashback and depicts gory details of ishiis revenge in a beautiful way the style of the movie is way different from anything you wouldve seen in a long time and thats for the best the movie catches your attention really well and just when you are about to drift away pulls you back many a times you would doubt whether the bride is really going to achieve her objective or not the movie speaks volume about style and movie watchers looking for some different style and great direction should definitely consider this for a weekend watch,cruel
volume 1 is awesome in every sense of the word its lady snowblood 1973 mixed with other famous exploitation movies such as they call her one eye 1973 all blended into quentin tarantinos talent of taking 1970s or 1980s cheese and making something unique with his camera skills the fact that he also continues to execute non chronological storytelling so well whilst also using both the quincy joness theme from tv series ironside 19671975 and bernard herrmanns twisted nerve 1968 further solidifies my love for this pictureone thing that really frustrates me to no end is that this film came under heavy fire from feminists i understand what the commotion is to some degree considering the picture is a dark gritty rape and revenge movie however thats kind of what really invested us in the brides quest and somewhat fuels our desire to see her succeed as throughout both volumes the character slowly became regarded as a cinema icon through the early 2000s for her strengths and independence regardless if it was a man chopping up hundreds of woman im sure wed hear complaints about that as well i guess theres no way to win them all and for those people it remains their loss as they miss out on some really good genre mash upsfor everything good i have to say i feel that some scenes intend to drag on but then again thats personal preference theres something for everyone whos a fan of yakuza samurai blaxploitation spaghetti westerns and hey even anime in the end im more than willing to watch through them all just to see how well done those action scenes are choreographedthe casting is also done extremely well david carradine most notably from the 1970s cult tv series kung fu is bill and its super pleasant to see both sony chiba whose renowned for his martial art talent and chiaki kuriyama again straight after the success of battle royale 2000 tarantinos favourite movie since he became a director in 1992 some of tarantinos regulars show up yet hands down the performance from uma thurman is what keeps you watching recently i looked up a list of female action heroes and no doubt tarantino and her input have created a character that would be well within the likes of sigourney weaver in alien 1979 or anne parillaud in nikita 1990final verdict tarintinos story of a womans quest for vengeance is told and shot beautifully it just gets better with every viewing 910,cruel
even if youve never seen a tarantino movie before the only thing you need to enjoy this film and its second part obviously is a sense of funvol 1 centres on the mysterious bride who is one fifth of a team of assassins only the other four plus mentor bill doublecross her and leave her for dead not a good idea so four years later she begins to get her own back on themlike i say this film is never meant to be taken truly seriously yes it is strongly adult in its content but everything is beautifully and knowingly over the top creating a comicbook style adventure for those adults with strong stomachsobviously uma thurman as the central character carries the film on her own but you wont find a dull or disappointing performance from anyone hereif you like tarantinos other work or just martial arts adventure or action films in general you should love this the only people i can see not liking the bill saga are those who want a hyper realistic film with its roots based firmly in reality this is not real this is fun and fun is sooo much better than real perhaps its only real downer was that it was split by the studio into two parts this makes both halves just slightly longer than you feel they ought to be yes it certainly forces the cinemagoing public to pay twice to watch the story but there are places where scenes feel they could have been left out in favour of making just the single story,cruel
when it comes to film making and cinematography this film is a masterpiece however i cannot give high rating to this movie as the biggest flaw in this movie is casting uma thurman this is suppose to be a martial arts cheesy flick and no matter how you see this movie it is a fact that casting someone with out any martial arts experience will not look authentic in the end if you look at her movements through out the movie in action scenes she was soft many of the scenes in which she moving really well is actually her stunt double zoey bell who is a black bell in martial arts and also does tae kwon do its like casting justin beiber to do a van damme movie simply he looks pretty i am not able to understand quentin tarantinos fascination with uma thurman and also his festishes with feet and other things which are quite evident in all of his movies if you want to enjoy a cheesy movie with no common sense or continuity then this is the movie for you to watch if you want to see a genuine martial arts flick this is not the real thing,cruel
when the serious and the nonserious rub shoulders with each other in a close borderline fashion we get to see a certain rare quirkiness the film as a finished work  simply put is eccentric now the serious is not as serious in actuality even within the context of the plot while the action is unfolding as we seem to assume at first then drop it and then again pick it up only to drop it again both alternate in so rapid a manner for us to miss seeing the borderline between the two so it brings a sort of relief in us from a fiercely farcical tension now this is obviously a film without any substance without a soul so to speak or at least the aesthetic is too much on the face for us to see even a semblance of substance in near vicinity it is for the most part our senses that revel in viewing the action while we are allowed rather forced to put our finely cultivated sensibilities to rest thankfully for the stretch of the movie to be sure the deeper chord it touches upon by being referential to cinematic violence as portrayed in western flicks martial arts or kung fu films b grade cinema does bring a nostalgic feeling of yesteryear cinemaviewing when we were in our schools and were not too serious about matters concerning soul and substance but instead believed innocently in all seriousness with our friends about myths legends and stories but then thats a kind of nostalgia we smile away and not hold it for long as what the film portrays or refers back to is such a nonserious unreal and superficial aspect of our juvenile stage of lives which is cinema itself such aesthetic works presents itself as light as a bird it flees away with a mocking smile the moment we stare at it with our serious adult killer looks the technique to achieve this effect is quite clear which is to go a little over the top but only this much and no more the ultrastylized barbaric scenes of violence portrayed in the film sheds the grossness inherent in any form of real violence instead transforms it to a pulpy something for us to consume and savor the action moves just about exactly over the top to make it appear stylish and appealing to our senses not just that it also manages not to fall in the pit of appearing all too ridiculous and comical or overtly cartoonish so we neither could possibly take offence of the kind of violence portrayed nor dismiss it as ridiculously cartoonish it hovers in the middle somewhere between the two for us not to grasp it firmlythe stylish killer woman warrior and the compassionate creator mother  the sophisticated don of a violent squad and the father on the floor toddling with his kid all in a single instance and that is something eccentric about the film and as if all that is not enough we also get to hear lines and dialogues delivered in a manner churned and treated out of a theorized and pseudoscholarly sort of text a sublimatedsomething in contrast to the pulpysomething we find in the action scenes this is not the controversial  heavy profane  the sacred or even the ridiculous and the sublime but the fair and light stylized barbarism  the sublimated prose the deadly don treats the childish concept of superheroes with a personal metaphysics so much for originality the film escapes from the eye of both the adult and the child instead it appeals to the infant inside every adult the long forgotten boy or girl inside us which likes to hear mythologies glee happily to distantworld stories and legends so we learn that the adult needs to be mature enough to bring the child over to the surface and glee  chuckle childishly while viewing the film,cruel
finally spent the time to watch this from beginning to end i thought the first half of vol 1 was great especially the scenes at vernita greens house and at the hospital so far so good everything was believable and within the confines of reality however vol 1 really took a turn for the worse once the scene shifted to japan it began with the animation sequence which lasted for several minutes it was several minutes too long shouldve just used some real actors but what was really disappointing was the whole battle against the 50 to 100 stooges of oren ishii thats when the movie became no longer believable are we really supposed to believe that one person can take out 50100 guys im pretty sure even bruce lee wouldnt stand a chance against those odds and all the gravitydefying martial arts stuff was ridiculous too therefore i give this a 7 out of 10 solid movie thats entertaining enough to make me want to watch vol 2 but the animation and the unrealistic fights were a turnoff,cruel
begins light and simple unique style of filming as its from point of view katie and micah get on with their normal lives with minimal problems but when the lights go out and the camera comes on thats when the activity begins the increasing paranormal activity in their suburban home has you on edge as bangs and screams will be unlike any other horror film out there real life reactions and realistic acting help the suspense in each and every scene grow creepier and bone chilling being a hardcore horror fan i thought nothing could get to me but this is something else entirely the finale will have you hiding behind your sofa or anything you can find i think this will and always will be recognized as the freakiest and suspenseful film ever made,cruel
you would be hard pressed to make the case that qt doesnt give bang for your buck this one is like an all you can eat smorgasbord for those seeking cuisine dine elsewhere this is for the really hungry and the financially challenged in short the masses in long the hipster pop culture and lovers of stuff and trash from the eggheads on campus to the lawn chairs of the trailer park it is so universally appealingdoes it matter that you may not get most of the movie comic book tv and music references no does it enhance the tarantino experience of course but it is not some sort of prerequisite this film club is open to nerds and jocks unabashedlythis is his wildest movie yet what it lacks in the trademark clever dialog it makes up for with an absolute unending display of mindbending liveaction cartooning just in case you missed the point that this is not to be taken as real there is an anime cartoon montage thrown in submitted for your approval this is the twilight zone so dont expect any of this to be taken literally if you do and you are outside the usa you are likely to label this rubbish if you are an american trash or crap or porn thats ok with the director he would most likely be flattered and say you get it,cruel
quentin tarantinos bloodsoaked revenge thriller volume 1 differs from anything the pulp fiction director has ever attempted unlike his previous crime movies volume 1 doesnt flaunt his distinctive way with dialogue and the characters are nothing like those in reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown tarantino still uses titles to establish locations and he divides this narrative up into several chapters although he plots the gritty action out of chronological order this movie isnt as fractured as his earlier films furthermore volume 1 isnt as referential as his earlier work indeed the characters dont mention other movies nevertheless contains other kinds of reference spaghetti western aficionados will recognize his use of musical selections from two lee van cleef horse operas luis bacalovs grand duel and ennio morricones death rides a horse one character whistles the twisted nerve tune that alfred hitchcock composer bernard herrman wrote as well as quincy jones ironside theme the closest that tarantino comes to visual cinematic allusions is the yellow outfit the uma thurman wears this is a reference to bruce lee celebrated asian stars sonny chiba and gordon liu have cameos michael parks one of the most underrated of all hollywood actors reprises his role as texas lawman earl mcgraw that he originated in from dusk till dawnthe first half of this two volume film set features tall slender uma thurman looking for the evil dastards that crashed her el paso wedding ceremony and butchered nine people including her husband our pregnant heroine was left for dead on the floor at the scene of this blood splattered massacre miraculously the bride survived this slaughter spent four years in a coma and only through the intervention of the man who very nearly killed her the eponymous bill wasnt killed as she lay in her bed when oneeyed assassin elle driver daryl hannah of splash visits her the recovery scene in coma ward rm 402 of the hospital is similar to but not as suspenseful as a similar scene in the steven seagal thriller hard to kill the first volume follows the bride uma thurman of batman  robin as she searches for those homicidal maniacs who changed her life forever she confronts the first in california and has it out with her vernita green vivica a fox of independence day until vernitas daughter arrives home from school the two women call a truce just long enough for vernita to try and shoot her through a cereal box with kaboom on it afterward the bride flies to okinawa where she meets hattori hanzo sonny chiba of the streetfighter and persuades him to forge her samurai sword like no other to take on oren ishii lucy lui and her army of swordsmen reluctantly hattori fashions a sword for her the first sword that he has made since he took a vow 28 years earlier to stop making swords part of the reason is that the bride tells him that he is responsible in part for what has happened to her silently hattori uses his finger as a pen and scrawls the name bill on a window pane he takes a month to create an entirely new sword from scratchbasically is a duel between the bride and oren tarantino stages some impressive battle sequences specifically the nonstop fight in a restaurant between the bride and orens army of yakuza killers youve got to have a strong stomach to handle the gory action as well as some of the unsavory characters principally a hospital nurse named buck who allows his friends to have their way with the unconscious bride until a mosquito awakens her from her coma tarantino doesnt something else that he has never done he has our heroine narrate the rise of oren in the japanese underworld and depicts her emergence as one of the top tokyo criminals in anime volume 1 concludes on a surprising note,cruel
plot summarythe entirety of the plot in is simplistic i think it lies within the title itself bill david carradine is obviously a main character uma thurman black mamba is another main character in the movie that desires nothing more than to because he shot her in the head the plot involves numerous acts of violence and murder inflicted by uma thurman on all her betrayers some of these betrayers are michael mattson vivica a fox and lucy liu she has a sequential list of all the people to take revenge on and bill is the last one themei am of the belief that the theme in is plot driven the actions of the characters are maliciously violent the violence between these characters is being committed for the simple reason of revenge,cruel
the part of the film i have chosen is chapter 5 show down at the house of blue leaves after the bride uma thurman wearing a yellow motorcycle jump suit has tracked down oren lucy liu after killing dozens of the crazy 88 the two have a spectacular sword fight in a snowy garden after crossing swords numerous times oren is scalped by the bride with her hanzo swordi would say the method of montage used in this scene was metric as the shot keeps being cut no matter what is happening within the image by doing this it elicits the most basal and emotional of reactions from the audience it does also have rhythmic montage in it as well though as when they are fighting the cutting is based on time using the visual composition of the shot the pace of the scene is really fast going as each shot is not normally more then a seconds this makes it feel like a more of a fight like you are there as in when you are in a real live fight it all happens so fast so this is what i think they were trying to active heremy opinion of the use of montage and the overall affect and styles is that it works really well from the start of building up the tension to the fast flowing action of the fight that gets your blood moving i think if it did not of have as many shots in it the effect they were trying to portray would not have workedi would describe the links from one shot to another focusing on composition viewpoint colouring and narrative as a job well done it s nicely flowing and it keeps you there you always know what is going on but at the same time it keeps it interesting and unpredictablei have selected this particular montage scenes as i think it is the best one of its kind and more importantly it keeps this up al the way throw out the film so you never loss interest and it keeps you wanting more so you are upset that it has ended as it keeps you griped so well,cruel
theres something not quite right with this film and its hard to put a finger on what it is the dialogue is sometimes clunky and seems copy and pasted like in the kitchen when the two girls are talking then there is the music towards the end of the film when she has the boot open its clunky it seems amateurish and its deliberate but it detracts greatly from the scene and the dialogue uma speaks is no better its supposed to be tongue in cheek but after repeated viewings its annoying that its not taken seriously aside from that the story is just non existent it plays out like a series of set pieces which is fine which is infact great because many of them are spectacular funny and very well done what it loses is real depth tension and a sense of progression such that when you watch this film again youll be waiting for your favourite scenes to come up and be annoyed with some of the less stellar ones like the totally ridiculous and boring hack and slash extravaganza with the 86 gang having said all that its well worth watching because a lot of works gone into it its original its different its entertaining and it has a quality to it that is rarely found in most films but still its a little patchy uncoordinated and flawed,cruel
before even beginning this review i think its important to note that you cant review both volumes of in the same document the films are just too different so instead just like the films themselves this review will come in a twopart series for volume one individualist director quentin tarantino reunites with his pulp fiction muse in uma thurman for a film that seeks to tell its own story as much as it acts as a selfreflexive work drawing influence from the kungfu exploitation genres popularised in 1970s cinemathe plot is nothing more and nothing less than a straightout revenge story as admitted to by the director himself a former assassin known only as the bride decides shes had enough of the life changing her name and getting married in a desert town with intent to begin again under a new identity naturally this dosent sit well with bill the head of the deadly viper assassination squad and the brides former lover and so surviving bills deadly ambush at the wedding chapel our heroine swears revenge against bill and his minions who cant stand the thought of her retiringthe film is definitely a case of style over substance in contrast to volume two where the sequel offers the majority of the backstory and character development volume one documents the brides efforts to cross two of the five names off her death list and is relentless in its depiction of violence and reference to the eastern genres it imitates on that front tarantino has done his homework basic character models visually indulgent cinematography wait for the epic fight scene between the bride and the crazy 88 and the very casting of david carradine who made a name for himself in television series kung fu shows a genuine adherence to the conventions that are almost exclusive to that genre positively qt does retain many of the filmmaking techniques that have defined his films as well including expertly executed tracking shots and a partly nonlinear flow to the story for a film with tarantinos influence stamped all over it one area where it is noticeably lacking is the dialogue usually very creative in giving his characters cool interplay to work with there dosent seem to be as much urgency in this film to give meaning to trough scenes instead putting all its focus into pure cinematic grandeur of course the unique nature of this film in just about every other category sets it apart from other actiondriven blockbusters but keeps it from being truly greatis first and foremost an exploitation film occasionally you do get the impression that in an effort to showcase his abundance of film knowledge qt is limited by the need to adhere to the conventions of the respective genres he is reimaging to suit a contemporary western audience and sometimes you cant help but sit back and wonder how much more imaginative his films could be if he played more towards the raw lessoperatic qualities featured in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction that being said this remains a solid film for its duration succeeding in its goal of both entertaining the audience and generating interest in volume two,cruel
the bride was the deadliest assassin of the deadly viper assassination squad until the day she decided to leave the business assume a new identity and get married but it was on the day of her marriage that her old friends  oren ishii vernita green budd and elle driver not to mention her boss bill  find her and assassinate the entire ceremony while bill shoots her in the head putting her in a coma well bill and his people should have tried a little harder because after four years the bride has awakened from her coma and hell hath no fury like a woman scornedafter the relatively disappointing jackie brown tarantino brings us back to the seventies with this slice of brilliant martial arts cheese probably his first real foray into the grindhouse territorythe film isnt meant to make much sense isnt meant to be realistic in the slightest this is just a film about a woman after revenge and a beautiful homage to the chop socky movies we loved from the seventiesthe best thing about the first volume is that we have no idea why she was killed by the viper squad and we no nothing about the brides background apart from the fact that she was holding the titular characters babythis is what makes the film so intriguing because not much is explainedso what we have is the usual tarantino dialogue stunning music which fits to every connotation and a great performance from thurmanthe rest of the cast are great too but we are left in the dark about the majority of them apart from the background of oren which is bought to us in wonderful animethe set pieces are wonderful and very imaginative and prove that tarasntino can do more than just write cool dialogueits not a gimmick that this film was released in two parts the first part is obviously a nod to eastern martial arts movies see sonny chiba in a glorious rolevolume 2 is a homage to the western genrethis is the most satisfying part though in my opinion it never loses momentum and the final line is a killer,cruel
as far back as i can remember quentin tarantinos movies have always failed to impress me he is a formalist film maker with action moves that seem to defy the laws of physics probability and the us constitution however i was really surprised when i saw vol 1 because it was the first time that i began to gain some respect for tarantino never before have i ever enjoyed uma thurman in a role where she kicked so much ass before lucy liu was good too but to me it didnt make sense that she would be speaking english to a room full of people who speak japanese from beginning to end the film was action packed serious and at the same time very funny and well photographeddont get me wrong i still have trouble watching quentin tarantinos movies and even this one still defied the laws of physics probability and us constitution but that last one doesnt really apply because the film primarily takes place in japan and also the film is so well done that even i as a film critic found it very hard not to enjoy myself but what gets me is why doesnt quentin tarantino make more films like this,cruel
is another prime example of tarantinos creative writing sure parts are a little contrivedlooking and farfetched but with that aside this is one action thriller the plot is straightforward but the action delivery and the vintage tarantinos writing with things out of place makes up for the basic plotif you like kungfu movies with a spice of creative action scenes this movie is certainly for you in addition to that the movie also sets up the next and it does not give you everything at once in result you can see this  and want to watch the next one and you wont get repetitive stuff in the 2nd one since the first one have purposely missing holes in the story great writing great acting and great action,cruel
after being gunned down on her wedding day by her former colleagues assassin black mamba uma thurman rouses from a four year coma with only one thing on her mind revenge striking up a death list of five she sets off for bloody retributionquentin tarrantino writes and directs what is in all truth a homage to all the cinema conventions close to his heart think an amalgamation of chopsocky sexploitation samurai spaghetti westerns anime and cop shows of years past and you get the heart of a film that was so epic in scope it had to be cut into two films what it lacks in tarrantino dialogue dynamite it more than makes up for with action and astute visual flair and its bloody very bloody thurman is great as the avenging mambathe bride while the inclusion of sonny chiba  lucy liu adds a touch of class as qt revels in his east meets west berserker narrative it could have been trimmed down particularly in the middle section where tarrantino deals in a calm before the storm ideal but volume 1 was one of the most exciting movies of 2003 and most notably it shows tarrantino to be adept at action directing his action skills perhaps explains why the script doesnt crackle with the wit and panache of his previous offerings you sense he wants more than the words fine writer engraved on his granite mined curriculum vitaehugely enjoyable with a neat end of film cliffhanger roll on part 2 810,cruel
i have read quite a lot about where there are references to other films in this film and i have got say i wasnt really looking for them and considering i am not that knowledgeable about film styles generally i never would see them i just know what i like and this ticks all the boxes i was captivated by this creation from second one and thoroughly enjoyed the two hours this is one of those films that in my opinion just oozes class yes there is a lot of violence in it and i suppose it is a matter of opinion whether it is gratuitous or not but the lady in question is not happy and with the skill and determination to carry out her plan she merely regards the next challenger as minutiae like everybody else on the planet she must have her limitations but thankfully other than being tired she doesnt seem to show any i dont look for hidden meanings or messages i am not that bright or indeed interested i have seen various films with less violence in them which i have not liked for all sorts of reasons mostly they are simply not very well made therefore i can simply say that for me the violence is in context with the storyline and because it is clear that the cast and crew have given a high level of care and attention to its content i consider it to be a very good film i would say that this film will not be to everybodys taste but i do recommend any adult watch it because in my opinion it is classy production,cruel
i have seen every tarantino film and loved them i loved reservoir dogs i loved pulp fiction i loved inglorious etc etc so my expectations were high for this film and let me just say it i was not disappointed the style of the film is outstanding and the action is wonderful its true this is probably tarantinos least dialogue driven film but dont forget this film was going to be released along with vol2 but then split up but when he does get the opportunity for some great dialogue he uses itthe soundtrack for this film suits it so well the scene where the bride visits hatori hanzo in okinawa to get some japenese steel and goes into the loft and all the swords are on racks on the walls its indescribablei had never seen any anime filmstv shows before i saw this the closest i had seen was linkin parks video for breaking the habit but after seeing orens anime i am tempted to go buy some all out anime films yes i enjoyed it that muchso to cap it all off this is a mountain of a film which i cannot recommend enough so sit back and relax to a very different style of film making that you are probably not used to seeing,cruel
if pulp fiction and fight club are referred to as the glorious wet dream of the 14 year old community then is certainly the 15 year old equivalent for the record i have enjoyed all aforementioned movies though to certain extents was released in two volumes but is essentially one movie so it should be judged in that way it is an action movie that pays homage to lets just use wikipedia here  the movie is an epiclength revenge drama with homages to earlier film genres such as hong kong martial arts movies japanese chanbara films exploitation films and italian spaghetti westernsnow apparently the more of the films pays homage to the more you enjoy this movie i am not a fan of this particular theory for example i had seen all the films in which the 2007 feature be kind rewind had made short rip offs of however despite understanding where the entertainment was meant to be coming from that did alter the fact that it was not enjoyable to watchi have viewed a total of two times now first when it was originally released and i was not such a big fan of movies and again after i had a much more extensive list of movies under my belt what had changed well i appreciated the editing cinematography and music more but my overall feeling was good movie never did the movie have the effect on me where i immediately wanted to rave about it to everyone in a one mile radius never was it intended to be the next citizen kane with performances that caused oscar buzz what was actually scripted to occur was the viewer going on a roller coaster ride though the nearest fun land this feature just does not stir me in that direction all you really do is catch reference upon reference and bare witness to a notable amount of violence and if that is the best that can offer on its menu then i severely doubt ill be staying for dessert,cruel
i found it hard to write a review for this film due to the fact i write them as i am going along whilst watching the film this is so i can get everything down that is in my head onto paper however i couldnt take my eyes off this film to be able to do that it hooks you in from the very beginning and doesnt let you go until the end of vol 2it opens up with the attempted murder of a pregnant bride uma thurman the audience only know at this point that the killer is a man called bill who apparently is the father of her unborn child though he still tries to kill her after finding out this information after being in a coma for four years she decides to begin her revenge on those who were involved her attempted murder this begins with vernita green vivian fox but not much is told about her other than she regrets what she did and she is now a changed person because she has a daughter it then goes to tell the story of what happened to umas character from the time she was in a coma introducing the other characters of the film and a bit about their back storyone back story which is presented beautifully is that of oren ishii lucy liu it is a dark disturbing tale that is shown through the means of anime the images are amazing but yet so wrong to watch the story then progresses to find the bride wanting a specific samurai sword to kill one oren ishii and her infamous crazy 88 whether she succeeds well you will just have to watch the film and find outthe cinematography throughout the film is spectacular every shot looks like it is something out of a painting this is particularly shown in the scene which contains the house of blue leaves the type of image changes in different scenes whether it is colour anime or black and white but each as amazing as the next there is a huge exaggeration on the image of blood it is bright red and the amount is huge however this does not make it seem comical or weird it fits in with the story perfectly and gives it that special unique quality the whole film endeavoursthe acting is also something incredible uma thurman creates a power within her character that lets the audience capture the true emotion she is going through she is the definition of girl power lucy lius performance shocked me a little she has an innocent look about her but manages to create an absolutely terrifying character i havent seen her in a role like this before her character in charlies angels does not count and her acting abilities shine through i think the best performance though came from chiaki kuriyama who plays the character gogo yubari her character is a sadistic teenager who sends a chill down your spine each time she smiles though she also creates a feeling that you should be slightly sorry for her even if she is crazy the character is portrayed perfectly by chiaki kuriyamaanother thing that gives this movie that something special is the music it sets the whole tone and setting of the scenes credit also goes to the choreographers of the film who trained the actors to perform the amazing fighting scenesthe final compliment i have for the film is that of the director and writer of the film quentin tarantino his imagination and skills have created something truly magnificent it is a classic film that will be remembered in many years to comewith all these compliments there has to be some complaints and right now i can only think of one and it is a pretty pathetic one at that the true identity of the bride is kept hidden from the audience they are not to learn her name until the second instalment when the audience learns the reasons on why she deserves the revenge she is giving out only then does she deserve to have the right to a name until then though it will be beeped out every time it is said in the most annoying way possible if it was done in a slightly more subtle way it would have been fine but it wasnt so it is the only flaw in the movie that i have to write aboutoverall fantastic movie,cruel
excellence is the only word suitable for this movie and story it is tellingwhen i first saw this movie to me it was the bloodiest movie i have ever seen until then tarantino was under strong influence of sergio leone and his spaghetti westerns and japanese violent cartoons which is obvious throughout all of the film one master of cinematography used the best from another one and combined that to create such an excellent artistic masterpiece there is some combination of action music from 1960s and 1970s movies mixed in unique style which is addition to almost perfect tale story about black mamba uma thurman who decided to quit with her profession of assassin after she discovered that she is pregnant she left the gang of assassins led by her former husband bill david carradine and tried to live ordinary life in some small place in american southwestbut bill did not forgive her that and when she was marrying another guy he came to wedding with his gang and killed everyone present in that massacre she was so injured that she spent next four years in coma she could be killed by elle driver deryl hannah while she was in coma but bill changed his mind and ordered elle not to kill her because his regret of what he and his gang did to her he understood that he made such a terrible mistake and decided to give her a fair chance to have her revenge if she can if he ordered her murder while she was in coma that would be against their warrior code and honor when she wake up from coma and escaped from hospital her revenge began during both parts vol1 and vol2 we see personnel stories of all members of the gango ren ishii lucy liu vernita green vivica afoxsofie fatale julie dreyfusbudd michael madsen and other people we see what led to events that eventually became conflict between black mamba and rest of them we see bloody revenge as one by one all gang members get killed except sofie left alive with hands cutoff and elleblinded when manba chopped out her second eye first was chopped out by chinese master who was their instructorelle later killed him by poisoning him which is the most shocking scene in both volumes  i had to turn my head off when i saw that we see bloody fight in japanese restaurant with lots of people killed also shocking and clash between o ren ishii and mamba by the end there is a final clash between mamba and bill what a scene excellence in simplicity before that she discovered that her daughter is alive and with bill they both tell her a story for good night before their final clash after bill is killed she leaves with her daughter story about one thing called revenge and it is served cold,cruel
tarantino was always a huge movie buff people complain that his pieces are unoriginal which if you fail to take into account what he does with the material i suppose is a legitimate observation but as a point of criticism the man has not claimed that he sets out to create something in no way seen before when he directs anyone who claims that their own work is in no way inspired by someone elses is a liar or in denial this one makes no secret about where he gets his ideas show me a single film of his that does nothing more than remake anything recent andor mainstream and i shall consider changing my opinion he makes homages tips of the hat to the genres and the flicks he loves the most this one is another and yet again we are in for a treat hes got us in such an effective grip that for a lot of this we viewers are at his mercy and he delivers fantastic shocks and surprises youll never know exactly what will happen or when or for that matter how this is undoubtedly the bloodiest and the one with the strongest brutal visuals of what hes done it has absurdity and has definite funny moments the choreography is excellent all in the name of doing wuxia or chinese martial arts on the big screen of the 1970s not having seen one myself i cant comment on how he does nonetheless i can imagine he nailed it he fit some western influence into it as well without it ever feeling out of place the dialog is marvelous and the delivery spoton all of the writing is masterful as a story about getting back at those who have done the greatest evil against the protagonist this is incredible the acting is perfect editing and cinematography are tight and sharp as a hattori hanzo the storytelling is smooth with the usual nonlinear timeline working impeccably well this and vol 2 are quite different and both are fantastic in their own way in this one the action is plentiful and awesome the music is beyond reproach on the dvd is a halfhour or so featurette that i will review on its specific page five minutes of uninterrupted performance by the 5678s and finally a trailer for each of the following reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown this and its other half i recommend this for any fan of his thurmans or of the craft 1010,cruel
after watching it i was stunned my jaw hadnt left the floor since the company intro its a vile and discussing should have beenx rated mess with all the subtly of a 70s exploitation flick its just too gritty very few of the scenes are free of blood fowl imagery or vocals said vocals also tend to be wildly offensive the use of dirty racist and sexist language is done without any restraint and rape scene while showing almost nothing still manages to leave a bad taste in your mouth one of the most screwed up lines is particularly stupefying luckily boss musumoto was a pedophile how is being a pedophile lucky sad yes scary absolutely but luck at points i honestly felt i was watching a cheap shock porn minus the nudity over all the writing is lazy making the actors such as they are spout aggressively stupid clichd lines youd expect to see in an early crime drama one major problem is how one dimensional and archetypal the characters are the bride had some spat with her boy friend bill bill gets his assassins to kill her they mess up so she hunts them down and kills them all bill last of course all the depth of a wafer unfortunately the radical shifts in plot and tone are bound to leave any viewer very confused at what is a very simplistic plot the music and sound effects are horribly outdated not to mention out of place said music seems to be more at home in a bad western then a terrible marshal arts movie possibly a black  white one as in places plus the sound quality was so bad an eight track would blush still these points are not enough to call it one of the worst things ever made by man i reserve that blame for the near constant ultra violence the fighting isnt as stylized as it is brutal and bloody chunks of human beings fly through the air detailed makeup shows grotesque wounds and red gets on everything there are so many shots where you can just feel the pain especial the ones with broken glass or anything else not directly intend to be a weapon one truly horrifying shot has a bit of wood with nails sticking out of it in a sixteen year old girls head with blood poring from her eyes the camera angles actually seem bent and hesitate to show maximum gore and near endless blood fountains despite the focus of the visceral nature of battle the actual fights are imposable one woman vs 88or so yakuza killers in a sword fight forget how unlikely it is that she would survive the first nanosecond why do none of them have guns the japanese mafia had been using guns since their founding in the forties what kind of terminal shift would cause them to consider sharp metal sticks as their entire weapons array for that matter when did a unisex tuxedo and ballroom mask become the uniform of organized criminals most of this movies action is just a string of physical impossibilities its one of the biggest ham n cheese movies ive ever seen and yet its so disturbing that any one who can be offended will be movie like this should be banned its so bad so insulting so terminally stupid that i loved every second of it its so far removed from anything ive ever seen and yet its a living tribute to everything 70s marshal arts exploitation art house film its terrible and shocking yes but it stands completely alone as a very selfaware action film with the actors delivering both epic and corny lines with chilling skill it combines humor drama action and even a tear or two like no other movie ive ever seen it comes in two parts the first bombastic and action packed and the second dialogue heavy and incredibly dark which one youll prefer is pretty dependent on youre love for wanton violence vs youre love for brilliant writing but theyre both stellar i highly recommend if you have a love of camp and gallows humor and if not it just might convert you the weird side just know that whatever your expectations theyre wrong,cruel
vol 1 is a quentin tarantino movie about a bride on a quest of revenge what she plans to do is kill all of the members of the deadly viper assassination club all the way down to the leader billoverall this was very well made there were parts in it that were a little on the edgy side but its all done to pay homage to all of the grindhouse movies which were about exploitation uma thurman does a really good job as the bride as well as actors like david carradine and actresses like lucy liu as the deadly viper assassination club the choreography in the movie was very much like what youre use to seeing in all of those old kung fu movies even though i dont watch a whole lot of themnow whats the catch well this movies not for everybody it contains a lot of blood and some deviancy but that doesnt really overpower the film i overall recommend it to people who are able to watch this all the way through but if you at some point become overstimulated by the violence then this wont be the one for you,cruel
is defiantly my favourite from quentin tarantino behind pulp fiction it certainly is just a fastpaced offyourseat action entertainment that can be watched over and over again mastermind quentin tarantino and uma thurman remeet after their grueling success of pulp fiction to deliver a wellbased movie of revenge belief strength and human spirit i can guarantee all youll never see the awesome sword fights and material arts anywhere else but in once again tarantino comes up with a genius script about a women who suddenly wakes from a coma releasing she has just lost her baby she goes out for revenge using her ridiculously powerful sword and material art skills a mustsee for each and every action fan theres plenty of blood loads of disturbing violence and a terrific ending,cruel
this movie was insane i loved both volume one and two from start to finish awesome effectsawesome fight scenes interesting plot unique in every way for the people who are saying this is garbage everyone who liked this is crazy and has no taste in movies i respect your opinions but i dont know how such a crappy movie can land both volumes one and two in the top 250 with thousands of voters love it or hate im pretty sure the majority loves it and all the actors and actresses played their parts perfectly this movie was worth every penny spent keep the movies coming qt once again 1010 2020 100100,cruel
this film was a relative letdown for me unlike vol ii vol i has little by way of substance its an incomplete chapter of a revenge saga and doesnt fully satisfy indeed after watching vol ii i felt that vol i was overlong and superfluous and could have been dispensed with entirely however the film is very stylish the fight scenes are impressive and uma thurman looks cool as she dispatches hundreds of men to their deaths with a samurai sword david carradines role is severely limited which is a pity there is a long anime sequence which is hyperviolent but works watchableoverall 610,cruel
okayi dont get ithow come that is on imdbs 250 list an dances with wolves or legends of the fall are notit just dont makes any sensei think is a great action movieit has a large amount of fun followed by good directingproductionchoreography and dialog but it just cant be as good as dances with wolves isits far from it actuallyor lets say gandhigandhi is on 165th place on 250 list an is on 136thits just not possiblei mean it obviously is but gandhi is a real masterpiece an it has a lower rating than i cant say that dont deserves this place or this rating in his genre but comparing to gandhi or dances with wolves or legends of the fall its nothing but a piece of crapsome people will say that i dont like tarantino because i wrote this but actually its absolutely oppositei am a big fan of quentin tarantinoi really like his moviesespecially the older ones such as pulp fiction or reservoir dogsthose were the real masterpieces but you can call it a masterpiece if you want but i cant believe that his rating is higher then ratings of the movies i mentioned earlierespecially than the one i didnt mention an thats the deer hunteror for example ben hurgone with the windmanhattanmystic riverbarry lyndondoctor zhivagolife as a housemeet joe blackseven years in tibet and so onand so onis a movie that guarantees youll have fun watching itthere is no doubt about itbut comparing to some other movies it dont deserves rating this bigthats why i think that imdbs 250 list is a bit idioticyou cant put drama and kill everyone you can see kind of movie on the same listyou just cant anyway its a fun movie and you should watch and enjoy but dont expect anything more than fun,cruel
to me is an example for why the medium film is a form of art just like paintings or literature the plot of is quite simple but the way it is staged is unique and i am not talking of bleedingedge special effects i mean the coaction of soundtrack and visuals effects achieved by camera positioning andor moving certain scenes being shown in black and white others in color and finally the quentin tarantino typical stylistic devices a naturalistic painting may be beautiful but still boring the same motive drawn in an expressionistic way can be much more exciting a true artist is capable of making even a boring motive look interesting i think its exactly this point that differs tarantino from other directors to me is a masterpiece of film art nevertheless i give it only an 7 of 10 because of the average plot and the flat characters,cruel
an outstanding movie from the mind of one of the best modern directors ever tarantino had always wanted to do this type of film a mix of film styles from movies that he liked in his youth presented in his own way he even went as far as including sonny chiba in the movie or gordon liu in 2 a few of his favorite actors from his favorite filmsanyway in short imho he succeeded in sharing his vision brilliant  this movie as well as vol 2 is not for everyone just like any other movie anyway and will probably be more easily understood by viewers from tarantinos generation who had enjoyed the same type of movies that he weaved into this masterpiece this is an action film and i rank it among the best of all time together with 2,cruel
this film is the reason why im interested in cinema i was young and with no cinematographic culture i saw the trailer and i was amazed with the development the film could have after i saw the film with my friends i started to inquire more deeply about films etc this film opened a door to me this is what it represents to me compared to the other films of tarantino is the best one it has a high level of photography pure actionit should alway be so and a simple but great story the direction is perfect it conveys a sort of lyrism in some scenes to me the whole package is complete but quentin were still waiting for the case i ve to say that im a fan of tarantino but that hes not the only thing i see ive seen and for example i disliked his last moviedeath proof,cruel
is an action packed adrenalinedriven enthralling violent overthetop bloody merciless exciting stylized funny and an extraordinary movie which seems to show no compassion to any person therefore people are shown bleeding to death though the blood seems to be like water gushing out of the body in an unnatural yet very wonderful way that makes the movie so good uma thurman is perfectly cast as the bride who swears to get revenge against the people of her gang who betrayed her she is tall yeah 6 feet is perfect for an action movie actress beautiful and very stunning as she shows to remorse in killing her former members and their people lucy liu too is very intimidating as cottonmouth her anime sequence was probably one of the best i have ever scene it is so demeaning petrifying when it is shown that her parents were killed right before her eyes and she too like bride gets her revenge the showdown between her and uma was really good especially the end result of itall the fight sequences were great for example bride vs the other lady member in the beginning was really a blast especially the very disheartening consequences uma vs lucys members at the party the latter was one of the bloodiest scenes i have watched till now but the thing that didnt make all these scenes too gory and shocking and fun instead was the apt background music that made the scenes sound as if they were just made to be overthetop and excitingthe story unfolds in a very beautiful manner with instances from the past shown in between to give it the look of a story being told by someone the bride in this case im going to go with a 9 for this one doesnt have much of a message and it isnt meant to have kudos quentin,cruel
this movie is different from other quentin tarantino movies because its more entertaining at least the first part there is much more action and violence and its fun to watch its a mix of black humor comedy martial arts and some elements of crime movie it looks like all the good stuff from different chinese and japanese martial arts movies was put together in one movie like all quentin tarantino movies this one is very stylish and has a great soundtrack there were many colorful characters so this movie looked like based on comic book there was also a lot of blood actually i havent see so much blood in any other movie,cruel
quentin tarntinos kungfusamurai epic is in my opinion his magnum opus the greatest thing about it though is how beautifully everything comes together and how astounding it all looks whether it be the silent snowy garden at the house of blue leaves or the red and yellowleathered back seat of bucks truck the first time i saw it i was just so captivated by everything it held that it was truly the first movie i saw that really made me want to get into film production i know how messed up it sounds to be influenced by such a stylized violent flick but i couldnt imagine it without the everflowing amount of blood to me its like tarntinos painting a picture with the bloodshed and it is so beautiful to look at,cruel
that would be this movie is far from perfect but it is perfect for people like me to an extent the quirky action sequences the primary colors the sosimpleitsgenius script    its unlike any liveaction movie ever made period but dont expect a gorefestevery trick in the book is used to make sure there isnt much blood on screen at one time the blackandwhite sequences literally turning the blood into water are the biggest example i wasnt impressed with the gore but i was impressed with the stylethis is easily one of the best followers of the punk overthetop style if i said any more than that it would ruin the movie for you,cruel
wow what a film yet again quentin tarantinos has challenged the audiences perceptions with an explosive touching imaginative filman instantly relentless intense and captivating film from the very start to finisha very questionable yet challenging and original idea for a plot that really distinguishes this film for me from others for me although slightly bizarre and cheesy at times tarantino cleverly incorporates cartoon humour and unreal fight situations to deliver this absolutely awesome movie to the audience in a clever yet slightly obscure way for me is more of a flourish of pure creativity than a film in the traditional sensetarantino has constructed a witty  and sometimes the interchangeable infusion of styles and influences that shift from scene to scene take time to bed down in the mind and can be slightly overwhelming ostentatious camera work hyperrealistic set design and gripping blood warming music all amalgamate to this thrilling truly captivating filmthe sheer theatricality and in depth subjects of will put some viewers off but i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone,cruel
volume 1 is the first part of a 2 part series of films volume 1 and volume 2 is full to the brim with guns sword play kung fu and litres of blood normally expelled from what remains of someones armleg or head and in an action film thats all i really need to keep me happyhowever its not all blood gore guns and bitchin fight scenes oh no has an amazing storyline straight from the head of the brilliantly twisted quentin tarantino thats another selling point for me as much as i like my mindless action and derive great joy from watching steven segal run up and down a train stopping to kick someones ass everyonce in a while i do love a good storyline and you wont find much better than volume 1the movie is topped off by a sweet soundtrack which can at times be ultimately cheesy and the swishy noises which follow every exaggerated sword movementi really cant praise this movie enough definitely go and see it,cruel
this film by far is excellent the whole plot had me staring at the screen wanting more till the very end the main character uma thurmanwas extremely awesome in the way she willed herself to take revenge on the people that attacked her the ultimate tell of revenge with kung fu action and gorelots of gore every visual in the film was fantastic the fight scenes were impressive and well choreographed the chapters of the film were amazing each and everyone witty dialogue and some funny moments lightened the tone of the film but not losing the context the anime part of the film was very well drawn and animated i love the way it broke the film apart and you had a little break to catch a breather before more action commenced what i thought was one of the best parts of the entire film was the soundtrack every single song was chosen for a purpose and they fulfilled that the opening song set the tone for the scene that followed every bit of music was excellent and made the whole experience much more enjoyable one of my favourite scenes was with the crazy 88s when the bride took on every single one of them i was just in awe of amazing that scene was it shows amazing directing and choreographing the roles must of demanded a lot of training and teaching and it showed with every stunt and fight scene i cannot express how much i love this film both volumes were amazing and i recommend them to anyone who isnt so easily offended by gore this is truly a masterpiece of film making and will always be one of my favourites,cruel
i watched this film with my mother one night and she doesnt exactly take to the genre of martial arts films except where bruce lee was concerned but had to have been the greatest story i have watched for a long time i understand that uma thurman learned to use the katana from the legendary sonny chiba himself who had a role as a sushi bar chef for over six months uma learned the art of wielding the sword like a pro and my own mother was awed by her use of it as well i said after the film that this was the greatest display of swordsmanship i have ever seen in my life to which my mother agreed in reply your not kidding where she gasped for breath at the end of the scene never in my life have i ever sat with my mouth open during a battle like that the carnage was unbelievable in a artistic way as well as historic the katana has always been revered as the most civilized way to solve disputes in warring clans of the shogun and samurai this was no different where the blue leaves caf was concerned warriors fighting to the death with honor and accepting defeat in the long run with no honor lost in the process and the final scene orin and kiddo that was something to behold where two female warriors facing off in the traditional manner until one is left standing unlike any other film i have watched containing martial arts this one held my breath and tarentino captured it perfectly giving us the broadside view of how the shogun lived and died with honor but just to let you all know in the second film where we see kiddo train with paimay using kung fu was excellent but it would have done more profound impact if they used the old world martial art where the shogun were trained with an art which was forbidden to outsiders until about 65 years ago the art is called hwarangdo and with this art the shogun were the most unstoppable force walking the earth which is why even the roman empire never tried to conquer because of the fact the shoguns always won every battle kungfu uses about 800950 moves and techniques white to black belt but hwa rang do when learned is over 4000 moves and techniques making the art the deadliest art on the planet tarentino should have used that as a good plot for the scene not relinquishing a strict and hard teacher in fact using a true hard teacher from korea in the art would have given the excuse to showing why she used the katana because the shogun or samurai was the ultimate masters of the weapon still we both thoroughly enjoyed fantastic display of traditions,cruel
is a hilarious film which makes the time pass fast the nonstop action and lines make them an incredible film i love the fights and they start at the beginning of the movie great fight they are enjoyable and for the people that love watching insane and lots and lots of blood you should watch this and also i think that the director makes the part of anime because it was very violent and bloody as same as the figth in black and white so although is bloody and all the director realize it and put on some boundaries what can i say its a quentin tarantino movie and quentin trantino movies are always black fun well done scripts and characters this movie should become a classic remember my words classic,cruel
i feel like tarantino kinda like takashi miike likes to cast certain actorsactresses as bmovieesquire novelties ie the female roles in this one darryl hannah lucy liu vivica a fox and uma thurman are all laughably terrible actresses particularly in these roles perhaps they do actually accentuate the comical stripes of this movie but i think a lot of people wont get this element i think this is fair enough movies are often exploitative by nature but i thought the female lead should have been a better choice the way these female leads are cast as opposed to the male leads makes this seem kind of chauvinistic my main gripe was the presence of uma thurman i dont think the woman can act or fight her way out of a paper bag  and it shows i know this film is a fantasy im not criticizing this from an academic or professional perspective it just made the whole experience kind of unenjoyable for me it distorted the sense of immersion the experience was trying to fulfilltarantino left out several of the fundamental elements found in classic 70s martial arts and gangster movies that other fans like him really appreciate here i didnt find the characters to be remotely memorable or believable i mean i didnt really notice anyone but the repulsive but attractive character of chiaki kuriyama most of the other characters struck me as kinda uninteresting whats weird is that his stuff is actually a little grimier than the earlier movies he takes inspiration from i did appreciate the camera work during that epic battle scene and the cinematography was pretty decent the sets were impressive and the costumes and aesthetics all very distinct and colorful in the line of yakuza and chambara flicks tarantino likes the choreography was not so much to my liking but a lot of this was because uma thurman is the focal point of the camera and yet she cannot move efficiently enough for the scene to be convincing lets just say its not a display of athletic prowess hee hee of course that kind of swordplay is hard to do its just weird someone so clumsy would be doing iti cant tell if it is cool or annoying that sonny chiba appears here its interesting that he appears not as an action star but as a swordmaker and why the bridebeatrix needs a sword is beyond me honestly i guess its just an excuse to provide a scene with swordmaking i found that whole scene to be a bit much  bmovie camp presented with the budget and lack of experience to make it pretentious its no makai tensho swordmaking scene thats for sure ah i guess the problem i have is that all criticism of this stuff can be written off by tarantino and his advocates as being bmovie fun or an homage to past flicks or ironic or intentionally unserious or just a fantasy universe he cooked up which all proves that this stuff is meanspirited or gratuitous for the sake of gratuity there is not much in the way of plot or likable characters to warrant watching this but just a penchant for mindless violence and suffering but i guess the characters arent supposed to be real since their suffering is not necessarily supposed to be affecting here i didnt see the same level of substance hidden beneath the violence in stuff like cops vs thugs or lone wolf and cub hee hee presuming those had it but i suppose this isnt entirely bad since tarantino has carved out a niche that is entirely his own bmovie camp with an alist production and hollow hip dialog  as well as the freedom to do whatever he wants with his artistic vision,cruel
this movie was really entertaining the fighting scenes werent greatly realistic but they werent really meant to be there is a lot of blood and it isnt for the fainthearted but if you can stand bloody violence then this movie is very very good the actors are surprisingly very good uma thurman fit in the role of the bride perfectly all of the main villains do goodbut some of the minors are funny but they made you kind of like them usually anyways it may not have all been actionpacked but it gave you much anticipation of those parts when the fighting scenes did come around they were very entertaining to watch and made me exclaimwhoah the ending left you wanting more a great bit of a cliffhanger for volume 2 910 great moviethis movie really got me to start watching a lot of tarantino movies and hes become my favorite director now,cruel
well i saw completely and i have to say it is a topnotch action martial arts extravaganza i usually dont see films that are just of action i like films that have something more and arent just for brainless entertainment and was something sort of like a popcorn flick but it was so much more than that the films opening is totally haunting we are able to see a tortured human being the brideplayed by uma thurman the first fight sequence involving thurman and vivicia a fox is amazing i mean that with the most emphasis i can give it ranks up there with the best openings i have ever seen the film grabs you and never lets go all of the martial arts fights are amazing i have never seen a film that has so much entertainment yet it is also because of the way they are donethe reason why the fights and all the other elements of this film work is because of the screenplay by quentin tarantino i have seen tarantino films classics like pulp fiction and while i was watching this film i could totally tell it was his film it has his sort of prints in it his screenplay tells a lot about morality and humanity and the script ha s a lot of gags and socalled cheesy dialogues but knowing tarantino this is a factor that i love in his films he is not afraid to have fun with both occurrences and dialogue in his films and that is why this film also succeeds for example the action sequences all have a bit of emotion to them especially us seeing what kind of character the bride is her way of sparing young people drove us to see her as a hero when in fact she is also a very murderous killer uma thurman gives a lot to this character and that is why we root for her and identify with her and in an action film we have to have this the screenplay only lets us see all these characters and giving each of them a little bit of humanity as for us to actually care who dies and who doesntthe film is also an artistic achievement this film is one of the most musicinfluenced i have ever seen there is a lot of bits of different music and the music is perfectly added in scenes as to give them more excitement and value amazing sound techniques to all the fight scenes and almost every scene the amount of gore and violence in this film is disturbing to some people but it really is done in a sort of comical way all the blood splattering the heads popping up it is all fun and being a tarantino fan i love this factor overall vol 1 is a masterpiece of martial artsaction fight films it is one of the most enjoyable entertaining and in that aspect qualityfilled movies i have ever seen for what it is it does not disappoint and i think it being such an original refreshing comical martial arts action film it will be remembered for a long time hopefully vol 2 is just as great,cruel
volume one and volume two are both great films and i love them both vol two is the better quality film but vol one is the more funis a simple revenge film influenced by material arts and samurai films it tells the story of the brideblack mamba uma thurman who is beatup and left for dead she was pregnant at the time and she wakes up four years later in hospital and she looks for revenge against her attackers oren ishii lucy liu elle driver daryl hannah vernita green vivica a fox budd michael marsden and bill david carradine the film starts with a regular quentin tarantino trait starting the film in the middle and showing getting ready to attack vernita it then tells the history about what happened with the bride and then shows how see went after oren simply because she was the easiest the find this was because she became the head of the yakuza in tokyo this leads to the bride going off to the japanese capital and taking on orens whole private armythis film works on a number of levels it is good on an actionadventurematerial arts level with a great fight against the crazy 88 like all of tarantinos films they is good dialogue he is able to get good actors involved and is deliciously violent there is great music tarantino is one of the best soundtrack directors around a fun violent anime sequence and they are good moments of humour the film also looks at some dark aspects of human life including revenge rape family lost paedophilia the list goes on tarantino is a good filmmarker and is new territory for him is very enjoyable,cruel
it must be said at the start that this film is a triumph of style over substance so if you dont like the style it wont be the film for you that said i really enjoy watching it from start to finish it is pretty grippingas im sure most people will know by know uma thurman plays the bride a former assassin who is left for dead after being shot in the head by bill her former bossthe film is not shown in chronological order so when we see her first fight it is actually the second person on her hitlist we then see in flash back that she has been in a coma for four years and has apparently lost her child once she has awakened we are shown a brief history of her first target the yakuza boss oren ishii this section is animated was made by people who have worked on some of the best known anime films so is understandably quite impressivebefore she can fight oren she must get a new sword from retired swordsmith hattori hanzo initially he refuses to make it as he had sworn never to make another deadly weapon but as soon as he knows who the bride is after he not only makes her a new sword but states that it is the best he has ever madewhen she finally finds oren she uses her new sword to dispatch a vast number of goons before the climactic fight with oren much of the fight sequence is in black and white i believe this was because the censors might not have likes the screen to be awash with bright red blood while the scene is obviously violent it is so over the top that it isnt really disturbingif you want a stylish action film that has plenty of rewatch value then this could be the film for you the acting is solid and the action is all stunningly choreographed,cruel
when i first watched this film i was shocked at how different it was to tarentinos other filmsit is very violent and has little story but is a great film and i recommend this to any human even though i know most people will not like it many fans of tarentino i know have described this as selfindulgent rubbishselfindulgent maybe but rubbish no way i just love this filmthe acting is superb for one thinguma thurman is outstanding as she lets her hair down and seems to be unintimidated by the concept of looking unattractive or un ladylikeshe leaves it all out there and obviously put a lot of effort and time in to this projectthe direction is obviously superb as we are talking about one of the best directors out therethe use of a sort of cartoon violence does not allow you as the viewer to take it completely seriously,cruel
i first saw the opening entry of the series theatrically and under sour circumstances stemming from some personal problems i was also in the midst of my own disillusionment with quentin tarantino but more so his overexposure and overhypea backlash had been in effect ever since the release of pulp fiction and the debacle of jackie brownthough still heavilypraised by criticsdidnt help matters much so by the time came alongwith again the predictable amount of critical praisei was ready to see if tarantino could put his money where his big mouth isthe verbose auteur announces that this is his 4th film and immediately puts a sour tinge of smugness over the proceedings though i feel the same way about the from the visionary director of tag that pops up frequently these dayswho does this guy think he is i dont think directors of any caliber or experience would ever be so pretentious as to draw attention to their work as if its the holy cinematic grail all us anxious spectators have been anticipating for years no matter how bombastic a directors ego may be behindthescenes most have the simple modesty to let their work speak for itselfand factoring in my preexisting attitude i was left less than impressed with vol 1 granted i had never been too keen on the samuraiassassinchopsockey potboilers tarantino was directly quoting but didnt think he did a very good job making the grindhouse aesthetic of the film accessible to the general viewing public as he did with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction a decade earlier in my view his ode to japanesestyle swordplay and literal fountains of blood could only be relevant to the audience members who had already established their fanfare for that genrefor whatever reason i recently decided to give both volumes of another look ive calmed down in regard to tarantinos offcamera persona especially now that qt crony eli roth is an easier whipping boy and am surprised to report that i had a lot of fun with both filmson its own terms vol 1 toys with viewer expectations in a variety of waystarantino lays out his tale in a very literary way dividing the film into chapters that free up the chronological constraints allowing surprise twists from future and past events to manifest at unexpected times there is a sequence that chronicles one characters rise to the highest ranks of the japanese yakuza in hyperviolent anime style the use of different color filters and blackandwhite to emphasize a particularly brutal flashback are utilized to stunning effect there is a fun nod to brian de palma early on in which daryl hannahas oneeyed assassin elle driverdons a nurses outfit to kill our heroine which utilizes a splitscreen and genre buffs will enjoy the use of a key musical theme from lucio fulcis the psychic actors like david carradine and sonny chibawho peaked in such similar fare back in the 1970sare given careerreviving roles hereamid all the homages tarantinorather than just slavishly imitating the works of otherssynthesizes the elements into a vision that is distinctly his own there are passages of dialog that ring familiar of his style clip and rhythmbut unlike pulp fiction where conversation became a plot point unto itself is far more interested in the storytelling aspect and progresses with a masterful authors flair one stunning setpiece that owes much of its effect to sally menkes sharp editing near the end of the first installment begins with a brilliant severalminute tracking shot echoes of de palma and scorsese that lets loose into allout pandemonium that goes on and on with irrepressible flair a spectacle of superb framing and stunt work and its interesting how vol 1 seems to shoot its figurative load in the first installment making viewers rightly wondereven after the lastsecond revelationwhere the latter half could possibly goas it turns out tarantino has more than a few tricks up his sleeve in crafting what could rightly be called his masterpiece75 out of 10,cruel
perhaps one of the greatest films in history blends traditional martial arts action black humor swords uma thurman and quentin tarantinobravo tarantinoi remember a similar story of my own my sensei encountered a similar problem with one of her old boyfriends except there wasnt retribution involvedbut unfortunately theres no cows in it  having cows would make it a 10 out of 10 for me bovinasanctaveritas,cruel
oh boy did i ever hear a lot about this one this is quentin tarantinos much lauded and only the first part of a double feature at thatthe fight scenes are spastic and energetic as hell the homages are as quirky and silly as tarantinos ever were yet perfectly woven into a story that the actors put on with dead serious expressions and the whole thing is as hyperactive as the energizer bunny on a sunday and while it feels incomplete due to ending right in the middle of the twopart story it remains an extremely entertaining and unique thrillride through and through,cruel
the quentin tarantino film unfortunately never appealed to me to be honest i was never a fan of his films and i honestly dont think i ever will be which is why i have given this film a poor review i am not being stereotypical just because tarantinos name is attached to it i just felt the film was to out there and over exaggerated as all of his films i have scene are although i should add i actually loved pulp fictionthe film in my opinion has many flaws which resulted in me giving it a poor review i personally feel the film failed to engage me i felt like i wanted to see the film just as how many others especially on imdb see it as a good and unique film however i was unable to achieve this i wouldnt say the film was boring or too quickly paced if anything the pacing was good but it just felt a little to quirky and weird for me for example there is one scene were a man is decapitated and the blood pours out like water from a fire hose i suppose many people would have laughed at this and see it as black humour but i for one did not i felt it was just weird this is a shame as i was hoping to love the film aside from the film feeling a bit weird and exaggerated at times i also felt the characters were too weird and just unrealistic for example the whole idea of a women seeking vengeance for the loss of her baby among others by hacking them apart with a katana just seemed beyond me as well as having unusual characters the plot was also quite terrible i mean dont you think that whole grrrr i want vengeance plot has been overused it just seems to be in way too many films i personally feel the only film in recent years that has pulled it off well is sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street due to the simplistic and clich plot i honestly feel this film does not deserve a spot on imdbs top 250 although i do understand that the film is loved by a lot of people i accept and respect there opinions but unfortunately can not relate to itaside from having many flaws i have to point out the positives as always tarantino films have an amazingly brilliant dialogue and this film is no different he manages to pull of dialogue that seems realistic and well placed and occasionally witty also another positive point to make is the scenes were shot from angles that i would have to say perfectly matched the mood and purpose of the scene unfortunately these positives are not enough to save this film in my opinionsumming up i would recommend this film only for people who enjoy tarantinos unique films and of course fans of anime overall i would give this film 44 out of 10 not good but not awful if you are a fan of tarantino raise my score to 8 out of 10 and sit back for a bloody fun ride as you will not be disappointed,cruel
watching volume 1 of again a few nights ago i remain convinced that this is one of the finest revenge films that have graced the silver screen from the very beginning is gripping and atmospheric amusing and riveting violent and uncompromising its not tarantinos best movie but it demonstrates the talent of this unique directorthe cast are excellent the direction is impeccable and the score is a dream thurman is simply fantastic in this movie and is very believable as the bride as she cuts her way to her ultimate targetthere are so many memorable moments in the film that its difficult knowing where to begin but its the action scenes that really stand out9 out of 10 unmissable,cruel
i am not a quentin tarantino junkie in all truth i find his fan club quite annoying but i must say this movie and note this review applies to both volumes is a good one the story chronicles a murderous uma thurmond name of character withheld as she seeks to eliminate the deadly vipers assassination squad or divas headed by the titular character bill cue a rollercoaster of blood betrayal bullets and samurai swordsquentin tarantino is despite any opinions i or you may have on the man is a good director and a good script writer the problem in judging one of his films stems from the nature of the writing the plot for this film is ignoring what was done with it clich beyond mercy and while comically unrealistic elements can be welcome every here and again the basic clich of the film cannot be ignored where this becomes a problem in passing judgment is in that all clichs are fully intentional and done to extreme levels thus the conundrum that would later be presented by the film grindhouse presents itself here if an overtly bad plot element is intentionally overt is the element still bad the answer is yes but a gray pool is likewise created where the movie itself can still be good this gray pool is what allows to succeed as a filmhow campy is it ridiculously whether it be uma thurman and lucy liu quoting the trix cereal marketing line or a fictional kungfu move that causes the victims heart to explode this movie contains many elements that are really stupid the fact that the movie again i speak for both can suspend your reality to the point where such camp is accepted common place in the world created marks that this film is an original accomplishment to clarify this movie takes what is lame and makes it clever and that is precisely why the movie is goodanother problem with that allows it to keep its brilliance is that the film doesnt know what genre it wants to be it is the frankenstein of kungfu western generic action anime dramatic comedy blood fest the basic story is the clich revenge story that one can see in far too many kungfu stories the music while holding a more asian flair during the more blatantly kungfu moment is carried by a spaghetti western through a lot and many showdowns will carry more than a subtle similarity to films like fist full of dollars or the good the bad and the ugly youll excuse me if i ignore their proper italian names at other moments the camera angles and shots seems strait out of an anime you have shoot outs that youve seen a million times over with a little bit of overtly comedic dialog in between over all these stylistic flairs is an ultraviolent drama of a homicidal woman out to create suffering in her former droogs around the sixth chapter the film being separated in ten chapters a factor that only finds need to be mentioned now we are introduced to a bizarre love story between the protagonist killer and her primary target the movie jumps from genre to genre so much that it becomes accepted should the shifts from stylistic themes be any less frequent the film would collapse on itselfone little element of the movie further adds to its success tarantinos trademark of showing events out of sequence pokes its head out in this film after a prolog with a beat up bride getting shot in the head we just to the first chapter of the film where in uma thurmond assaults the second name on her hit list chapter six takes us to a time before the prolog and later still in a chapter whos specific number escapes me at this time takes us back to uma thurmonds martial arts training by the end of the story you will know the all the rationale behind all the characters actions as for plot wholes a problem any film like this has to work harder than most to prevent i couldnt find anywhile this film succeeds on pretty much every level it strives for it is not a perfect ten the story does its best to keep the action moving and the story interesting but the second part does move a little slow near the end likewise while the story is a quirky bizarre thrill ride that one wont soon forget it grabs from so many other films that it cannot be rated as its own original work so much as the ultimate showcase of underappreciated film techniques that one doesnt see too often in modern cinema while not film perfection or even an all that original story is a solid film that will entertain most who see it and will show a new twist on archetypes that have been done to death,cruel
quentin tarantino returns after six years with his fourth film an homage to the kungfurevenge flicks of the 70s uma thurman plays the bride an assassin who abandons her murderous lifestyle and tries to settle down into a normal life unfortunately her former boss bill has other plans and turns the wedding into a bloodbath four years later she awakens from a coma and begins the path of vengeance tarantino split the movie into two volumes so this movie doesnt present her full questtarantinos film is a bloody throwback to the kungfu flicks he grew up with the story is simple but the films style more than makes up for its simplicity the choreography of the fight scenes is phenomenal uma thurman kicks some serious butt obviously having trained long and hard for her role id have to say my favorite is the brides duel with oren ishii lucy liu between the grace of the combatants and the latin sound of dont let me be misunderstood by santa esmeralda it feels almost like a violent tango during the epic fights blood erupts like a volcano from nearly every wound it looks ridiculous but cool and still people freak out about the amount of bloody violenceof course with the fantastic fight sequences we get a good dose of tarantinos writing with its sharp dialogue you can tell everyone starring in this movie is having a blast and enjoys playing their roles one of my favorite highlights of the movie is sonny chiba in his role as hattori hanzo a reference to one of his most popular kungfu roles liu and vivica fox are fantastic as the brides first targets on her death list five there really is a lot to enjoy in this movie if youre looking for a good hyperviolent time tarantinos throwback to the 70s grindhouse kungfu style is a great followup to his previous work and one of the most entertaining films hes put out yetthere are a lot of complaints about this movie but viewers have to realize this is what tarantino wanted he stayed true to the style of the old martial arts flicks and modernized with his own flair yes there is a lot of blood but its almost cartoonish in quantity for me this is one of those simple guilty pleasures check your logic at the door and settle in for some great entertainment,cruel
quentin keep surprises me ive noticed that all his movies got the kickas soundtracks in them and i thought the one in were quite catchy as wellive heard rumors that this movie was supposed to be awfully violent hehe no failure there but i think violent belongs better in movies than on the streetsmost of quentins movies has a very unique style in some way tarantino manages to make you feel that youre watching and old classic like pulp fiction well about now it is and old classic it takes place in a sort of 50s town and it looks like the movie was made in the early 70s unfortunately i didnt feel the same for this movie well in some scenes but not very strong if you compare to other moviesanyway i think this movie was entertaining and im not referring to all the violence it actually was an ok movie since you only can vote with straight numbers on imdb i will give it an 8 its a rather weak 8 i have to admit it would be 75 or so810 it will give every karate fan satisfaction,cruel
this film shows tarantino at his best the film immediately gets the ball rolling when you see the bride all beaten within an inch of her life only to hear a mysterious voice bill emphasising that he is not sadistic with his actions then before the bride has a moment to speak boom she gets shot in the head the moment has you jumping right out of your cinema seat and has to be one of the most gripping sequences tarantino has opened a film with to datefrom then on the film is provides an excellent storyline that consists of themes from all types of film genre the film starts with a bit of western which is more the theme in volume 2 but has its good moments the plot of revenge begins to spark with the bride fighting veneta green vivica fox which has a bit of martial arts tarantino also was able to throw in a bit of blaxsploitation you get a bit of thriller thrown in while the bride remains in a coma and when she wakes up the theme in this scenes are so dark and it is backed up by an eerie soundtrack that as you on the edge of your seat the film builds to a climax when you learn of oren ishiis background and origin which puts an anime sequence into great use the climatic part of the film is the whole sequence at the house of blue leaves it is a film sequence that will be remembered throughout cinematic history forever the whole atmosphere the music the characters and the buildup to some of the best fight choreography i have ever seen this has to be uma thurmans best film i do not think any other actress could have pulled it off overall a great film many complained of the extent of violence i disagree it is most definitely needed it would not fulfils itself as a revenge movie otherwise,cruel
you are never bored watching this film and you are never confused this film is surreal fast paced darkly humorous dynamic artfully aesthetic and and violent i did not find the violence in to be stark and cold like the kind you find in a bloodandgore horror flick and at times the violence was purposefully humorous in that tarantino sort of waythere are at least four scenes that i can think of in this movie which are unforgettable and make this movie a genuine classic visually the movie has just about everything the cinematography in this movie is absolutely unsurpassable quentin tarentino is a true master and this film may well be his masterpiece there is some hard violence in this movie while at the same time allowing for fight sequences which almost have a superhuman quality it should be said that the violence is darkly humorous at times as is the case in many quentin tarantino filmsthis film has two volumes but you can enjoy volume 1 without watching volume 2 on the same dayincidentally lucy liu and uma therman deliver two of the most memorable and provocative action movie performances i have ever seenthe think the thing i like most about tarantino films is that you get all the intelligence humor and postmodern mayhem without all those boring good guys,cruel
look this is an action film and should not be taken seriously i mean at least not where uma thurman has a sword with her on a plane to japan i cant remember exactly where the point is that you should enjoy it for the action cursing and special effects not so that you could point out the weird stuff ok lets move onuma thurman is really cool like ultra cool she is the perfect one for this role and she plays it good too not that its that hard to play she wakes up after a coma her babys dead and all she wants is revenge the flashbacks and her way of getting to where she wants to be with bill is awesome the special effects where like some of the best and coolest ive ever seen besides its tarantino can he ever do something wrong lucy lieu daryl hannah and vivica j fox were all great as members of the assassination team that thurman wants revenge on the part where thurman and lieu begin fighting is really cool beautiful too with all the snowdavid carradine is good as bill the man thurman wants to kill more than anyone he keeps that kind of mysterious crazy man all through the filmits kinda hard for me to picture michael madsen in any kind of different role after watching reservoir dogs one of my favorite movies a hundred times except for mr blonde but here he shows once again that he was born to play tough guy roles but for me hell always be the coptorturing earslashing off  man weirdgood job quentin tarantino for once again giving us one of the super coolest most violent movies ever and for picking out the perfect cast to go with this film its a good film and shouldnt be taken seriously at least not more than it shouldthanks for reading my comment,cruel
uma karuna thurman is hardly sexy womanshe is 6 feet tall183 and her appearance is very cute and of course she is sandy blondlove herbut the movie was good too some scenes was lame for surebut effects was gooduma thurman role was brilliant because she is good actresslucy liu she is too good actressbut these ninjas was damn lame just pointless it was the worst part of the movie this sword that the bride used was beautiful swordand to to the haters of this movie go asand believe it or notbut taratino is one of the greatest of our timei personally recommend it to watch this movie7010some people say this is a overrated film maybe its truly a little bit overrated but still pretty good and uma thurman is sexy badass,cruel
i loved this film and volume 2 to bits its just brilliant im reviewing both movies herethe action is done to perfection all of the actors are great in my view this is uma thurmans best film as she is brilliant and clever at the same time  david carradine is brilliant as bill daryl hannah as elle driver excellent her rivalry with kiddo is excellent witty and funny michael madsen as always really good quentin really knows how to use him lucy liu as oren is great as she plays someone you have sympathy for considering her childhood and finally gordon liu as pai mei was brilliant as he is so well skilled and treats be like a dog the bit where he puts his fist though the plank of wood makes me jump every time i see it overall its a excellent film with some of the finest action and dialogue i have ever seen in a film,cruel
firstly reseviour dogs secondly pulp fiction thirdly jackie brown fourthly volume 1 this is the forth landmark film written and directed by quentin tarantino who does not slip up negativity on 95 of his films this is a true vengeance movie serving up lots and lots of blood and gore and fine acting from urma thurman and lucy liu director quentin tarantino has produced yet another masterful epic and the story couldnt have been betterurma thurman plays the bride who was gunned down at her wedding by the notorious deadly viper assassination squad taking a bullet to the head by her ex lover bill the bride wakes from a coma realising her pregnant baby had gone when awoken she seeks revenge upon the five members of the assassination squad who destroyed her life and her babyone of the very finest tarantino films i have ever seen along with pulp fiction i have not yet seen volume 2 but i certainly intend to without a doubt enjoy the fresh decapitated heads arms and legs flying across the room be intrigued by the story and characters that are all given fine detail to,cruel
vol 1 2003quentin tarantino has to be the most unorthodox and unconventional director of our time that is what makes him great and his films always a surprising treat always filled with violence and humour is no different perhaps with the slight exception of tarantinos jackie brown all his films focus on style over story so does a film that doesnt focus on storyline  well let me try and sum up the film the bride thurman is savagely attacked by the former group of assassins that she worked with she recovers after 4 years and wants her vengeance naturally top of the list is bill the boss hence the title no more no lesstarantino focuses on his obscure pop culture references the music which is superbly picked the style and above all the frequent bloody violence splashed across the whole film this is a film based on style not subjectstory that is where many people tend to give the film 10 or 1 i myself stand in the middle with a fair 7 avoiding a 1 or 10i cannot recommend this film because it doesnt apply to everyone what i can do to help you understand if you would love or hate the film is list a few elementswhy you might love vol 1outrageous frequent intense bloody violence fabulous cinematographyundisputable styledry humour obscure pop culture references sprinkled across the whole film beautiful music its a tarantino film you have to like ita sensational martial arts extravaganzawhy you might hate vol 1outrageous frequent intense bloody violencestyle over storylinetheres a five minute anime cartoon in the middle of the film my review your choice710,cruel
in 2003 uma thurman will thats what the tagline was to this critically acclaimed film from cheesyviolence loving director quentin tarantino which sums up the dry attitude of the movie perfectly nothing can prepare you for a movie like none otherthe story follows the bride thurman a woman who has been backstabbed and nearly murdered by a group of assailants to whom she once associated herself with there is a lot of background information given out throughout with most of it told in a very imaginative and mesmerizing way courtesy of thurman with dialogue this interesting and gripping its hard to be bored at all through the entire duration of the movie back to the story when the bride was planning on getting married hence her moniker the entire church was bulldozed with artillery fire from the assailants everyone is murderedexcept for the bride that is she was near death but her family members her future husband and her unborn child are all gone the bride is a woman with nothing on her mind now except for sweet and very bloody revengeas it should be noted is a very bloody and violent film however most of the violence is presented in a humorouscheesy fashion such as gazers of what appears to be a hose shooting out red kookaid or the like in telling the background on oren ishii liu thurman narrarates through a roughly 10 minute anime scene showing how ishii became a serial killer this is really dumb with pointless lines and some unnecessary violence that misses the boat completely plus its anime which means it is just dreadful in my opinion i know some people like that art style and the unique storytelling but i dontoverall is to be missed by no one the soundtrack varies to nearly every genre of music with nearperfect results on all tarantino has shown that he is a master at his unique craft the very intelligent yet simple movie,cruel
was a brilliant movie perfect for adults i wouldnt recommend it for children under 12 or 11 depends on there attitude it is really violent and yucky but it is cleverly done thrilling and exciting cool music and good acting although the blood spurts are a bit fake cause it wouldnt happen but still looks pretty wrong the costumes in it are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool and so are the swords uma thurman is the part for this job special effects are pretty believable just try to close your eyes in the gruesome bits because it is pretty fowl i really recommend watching it because you cant go wrong and then there is the sequel,cruel
amongst the seven films quentin tarantino has directed to date vol 1 has got to be the most pretentious of the lot a revenge tale cut into two feature films due to its overlong running time part one brings us the color and style whilst part 2 that was released to theaters half an year later is a much lesser film in my opinion that contains more plot and substance but lacks the fresh and surprisingly stylish cool breath the first installment had to offertalking about style vol 1 is all over the place tarantino quotes klingon catch phrases gives out an outstanding homage to 1970s kung fu features mixes it up with anime and an outrageous nonlinear story as an intriguing plot device  and covers it all up with one of the best soundtracks ever heard to date do you find me sadistic bill asks our protagonist a catatonic bride beaten to a deadly pulp on the day of her wedding what tarantino really wants to know is do we think hes a sadistic fellow himself teasing us with all these genres jumping from one end of the plot to another and probably hailing to himself all the while ive done it im a geniusso yes mr tarantino you are a genius taking a semi been theredone that story of a vengeful bride out on a murderous rampage to avenge her near death experience after spending four years in a coma and turning it into solid gold is not an easy task to live up to there were some tarantino films where i really couldnt understand where he was going with the story in this case the plot is very clear even with all the continuity issues and each of the actors shine in their respective roles tarantino created a whole new world of organized crime on screen carefully crafting the deadly viper assassination squad from colorful characters with fine actresses like lucy liu and darryl hanna giving out gorgeous performances but all these superlatives cant be enough to describe the extravagant nature of uma thurmans portrayal of the aching humane vengeful bridewatch out for the training scenes with sony chibas hattori hanzo the brides final battle against the crazy 88 ive never scene so many limbs chopped off in such an artistic manner even the horrific sprays of blood seems choreographed right down to the very last one and the dramatic opening scene which shows us the bride taking the bullet that put her into the coma seconds after confessing to bill whos the father of her unborn child once the credits started to roll and nancy sinatras bang bang my baby shot me down started playing in the background i was hooked thank you mr tarantino,cruel
i am a fan of quentin tarantino and i must say that this film really impressed me much more than expected i didnt expect it to be as fantastic as it is like all of the tarantino flicks it does not go in chronological order so it did throw me off at first glance but it was full of action and it really was about redemption and justice over betrayal it was like a greek drama where the emotions and action was pure and exaggerated rather than realistic which made it even better also uma thurman fit the role of the bride like a glove there really isnt anybody else who could have played the bride as well as she did uma absolutely rocks in this film and in the second one as well and if you didnt notice sonny chiba who played hattori hanzo was from several samurai shows from the 70s the cast was excellent the dialogue was awesome and the cinematography was gorgeous this is quentins best yet shame on anybody who calls this film overrated or terrible,cruel
first off im going to tell you that is the most violent movie i have ever seen it crosses all boundaries actually it beheads dismembers and slaughters all boundaries it is superviolent gory funuma thurman in my opinion should have been nominated for an academy award for her stellar performance as the bride a woman whose entire bridal party was massacred by bill david carradine her former lover and his team of assassins the bride wakes up after four years in a coma and finds the baby she once had is gone so she sets out on a quest for vengeance against all those who wronged her by killing all she cared about she does so in bloody exciting action sequences with a nice big samurai sword obtained from a master swordmaker sonny chibathis is a great ridiculously violent movie filled with the signature hilarious tarantino dialogue and action,cruel

okay i watched this movie i admit just because a good friend of mine told me to watch it or i would have never done it why because from the advert i felt it was somehow a silly movie well i guess i was wrong it is a truly insaaaane movie yes you know i am right eh ehi started watching it rented it on night didnt know what to do and i wasnt that bothered to watch it but i was curious to see how it was so i started the movie in the player and there comes this lady in black and white and im like what the did i just pick the wrong movie or something then i stick ahead to the chapter after and i enjoy the stuff with vivica j fox im like oo whatta hell and after that incredible stuff congrats to the crew and to tarantino i was what the hell man so i stepped back into the video shop and rented the other one the volume 2 and got back home ready to watch them bothwell no lies i was truly amazed at the end of the first not because of the end itself but because of the film all over it has got this chapter thing which is insanely enjoyable in the way the movie is laid out then the cast wow what cast uma is simply terrific in her part the battles are extreme and the other actors know what they are doing there are basically no bugs i have to point it was all over perfect normally in a movie like this action i would criticize the realism but not in this one is so insane that it has got a realism of its own a reality of this movie which doesnt want to be realistic it just pretends to be a shocking movie and it succeedseven if its violent and direct lots of blood and stuff i suggest it to everyone who likes action movie its really a diamond pick something those action lovers will adore but i guess at this point everybody would have seen this movie and thinks the same,cruel
is perfectit achieves everything it set out to do from start to finish  and thats all there is to it moreover it is the rarest of flicks as far as i know it was entirely original something i thought was impossible in this day and age from a highbudget hollywood film the piece transcends the criteria of movie into arttarantino does not attempt to tackle any morally ambitious subjects critique society or explore human nature all traits normally associated with great films instead he delivers a spectacular fourhour bouquet of martial arts borrowing from dozens of sources yet copying none,cruel
tarintino really has one hell of a crazy brain but luckily knows how to use it to his advantage in cinema for those who saw pulp fiction and resoivoir dogs this brings back some of his charm in a more violent wayi thought the plot is pretty thin but it is strong enough to stand on its own as a story uma thurman is out for revenge after being beat up to almost near death by her exgang members next she is out to kill her enemies one by one until she can reach the final guy billits a crazy film that sometimes doesnt take itself too seriously but thats what makes it fun the violence is usually laughable so you forget that its all violent the music is absolutely amazing that track that plays when lucy liu walks down the restarant aisle is bloody cool what makes this a good action flick is that the gender is equal both girls and guys kick ass but with the japenese anything goes in this filmthe only letdown is that the substance of the film is a bit lacking you dont really know much about this character of umas entitled the bride or black mamba  you dont know her name in the film yet you cant help but feel sympathy for her having lost her baby in a coma and everything it takes guts to take on a hundred or so japanese swordsmenan enjoyable film nevertheless,cruel
at first i wasnt sure if i would like vol 1 because i dont watch that many bloody movies im more in to comedies dramedies any thing by charlie kaufman etc but i watched it and it was bloody in a funny kind of way i mean in the movie oren the first person the bride tries to kill slices off a mans head and i thought this is going to be nasty then the mans neck was like a red sprinkler squirting in the sky some parts you cant help laughing at how silly the violence is by the way the story is about a woman who wants revenge sounds simple right wrong the film sounds simple but you know something is weird when you see chapter 1 2 you may think it would be hard to follow but the way it is made is that its in the wrong order but in an order that is made to make some sense the movie is violent awesome brilliant dramatic funny at times awesome awesome and more awesome i really recommend this movie to japanese film lovers action lovers revenge movie lovers and well everybody watch it i give it a 10 out of 10,cruel
its hard for me to pick which of the two volumes i like more mainly because theyre so different in style i think i like this one a bit more just because the action is topnotch and its very fast paced theres not a whole lot of story here which works fine but it does feel like a bit of a letdown at the end possibly because its so much shorter than the other volume i liked a lot of the artistic touches the massive blood spurts the anime backstory the stylized fighting but i felt it became too much at times i dont know if pretentious is the right word but thats what i felt at times still its a pretty good action flick if a bit too overthetop,cruel
grew up in new zealand and have missed kung fu since then then i saw here in denmark and i felt davad carradine had made up for being gone so long in such a good role had seen him a bit round and about but i dunno just had that cool zen thing going on like life cut up into manageable pieces im not a major film buff but i did like pulp fiction too although ive forgotten already remember uma zarantino must be cool the thing which got me most was the talk at the end of cool action story human relationships like believable did he die or did uma go out and take pity or give up too interesting philosophy capturing of peoples ways actually felt i could see these people the actors and their relationship to these aspects from some form of therapy i do reckon the old master what did he say you traitor that was still the point and her darryls lesson or downfall and major points for uma and hanna together and for age and for philosophy zarantino just got the right connections no one can normally be bothered making great stuff i think the market is way too limited,cruel
ive been told by some that they thought was just a ridiculous unrealistic movie i usually peply with something like if a movie was realistic do you really think anyone would watch or like it may not have the best acting or story ever created but guess what it wasnt meant to tarantino purposefully wanted it to be sort of a throwback to the cheezy actionkung fu movies of the 70s the action in this movie is obviously the biggest draw with its highoctane noholdsbarred style it sometimes transcends entertaining and and passes into aweinspiring however an overlooked facet of this gem of a movie is the music it is a perfect combination of western and japanese style with one particular song the one playing on the main menu of the dvd that is very catchy overall id give it a 910 not exactly perfect but as close to perfection as ive ever in an action kung fu film,cruel
when i first watched this movie i was hoping for the best i got what i asked for first of all the plot is great the bride uma thurman gets gunned down at a wedding and looks for revenge in the bloodiest way possible quentin tarantino did some great job doing this movie i knew that they were originally going to do both in 1 whole movie but both by themselves are great the end well it made me definitely want to watch vol 2 oh and the fight scene in japanese restaurant that was filled with blood action and i really liked it it was actually kind of funny with the fake blood and all you didnt think it was going to be that easy now did you you know for a second there yeah i kind of did silly rabbit trix are for kids i liked that quote that is what started the fight between uma and the yakuzas i think they were called the 87s but i dont remember anyway great movie great action quentin tarantino thumbs up man,cruel
the saga will go down in history as two of the bloodiest films ever made vol 1 takes about 90 of the violence for both films the film holds nothing back in story telling or action sequences all filmed with masterful sword play the film is full of fun and quite impressive for an action filmuma thurman is the bride a seemingly nameless woman put into a coma for 4 years after her exboss who happens to be the leader of a group of assassins has her shot for desertion the bride awakes to seek revenge on the 5 people who caused her life to become a living hell the first film is more of a flash back to the bride chasing the first person she is after oren and her second person vernitathe actors do a wonderful job with the story line and the characters they portray uma thuman is slowly becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch she is smart she is cool and she is hot she has that air of power on the screen when watching her with the sword and the dialogue she speaks she has proved herself to be more than just a notalent actress in it for the lookslucy lui delivers a strong supporting role as the japanese gang leader oren she is silent and powerful lucy lui was able to show the audience real quickly that oren is not someone to mess around with in the film lucy lui isnt well known to me she was in the failure that was charlies angels so i never knew she could actually act she changed my mind in this her casual demeanor and quick sword play makes her one of the best characters of the two volumesthe movie makes many homages to past film genres such as the kungfu genre of the late 70s the film is filled with the fighting music from those kind of films and i actually like the little homage made by tarantine to the late genre tarantino is a master of making things work on screen and one of his best achievements is the combination of the corny music with the incredible fight sequencesnow the film is not entirely believable that is evidence by some of the things the bride and a few of the other characters are able to believe however the film is not meant to be believable but instead a story being told the fight sequences are elegantly crafted and filled with spectacular stunts the last sequence in the film has gone down as one of my favorite pieces of action in film history right up there with dday from saving private ryan and the battle of sterling from braveheart tarantino is a master of dialogue and there is not one dull moment of speech te conversations make sense theyre well crafted and they are easy to follow unlike some films what tarantino does is that he does not fill the conversations with big words few understand but instead makes the sentences short and easy to understand for anyone the film is very violent one of the bloodiest ive seen no one under 16 should see this 45 stars,cruel
if you havent watched the film yetit will be better for your sake not to read this commentis about revenge of the bridewho was betrayed by the squad once she was inive watched vol 1 and vol 2 on the same dayin this comment im going to explain what makes vol 1 perfect one by onevol 2 is as perfect as vol 11music qts choices are perfectwe first hear nancy sinatras bang bang when the movie startsthis is the perfect proof of the films excellencethis song absolutely fits the movieas the movie continues we hear the fitting song for each scenethe music had a big effect on me while i was watching itfor example after the harsh battle between the bride and oren ishiithe song of meiko kajis touched me a lot that i felt sorry about the way things had happened2actingi love uma thurmanshes was the only one who could have portrayed the bride perfectlyshes the best thing about the movieim not a fan of lucy liu but i must admit she was absolutely goodshe performed oren ishii flawlesslyshe was coolcalm in every situation as oren ishii was meant to be and her rarely seen reactions were convincingi cant say much about vivica a foxwe see her only at the beginning but she fits the movieand daryl hannahthe actress which made elle driver my second favourite charactershe doesnt appear in this volume much but the whole hospital scene was hilarious3quentin tarantinos touchof course this movie wouldnt be this good if it wasnt done by qthe connected all the events in an excellent wayill really count how many times ive used the words such as excellent and perfectin conclusionthis movie is one of the best films ive ever seenim sure i wouldnt get bored if i watched it a hundred times,cruel
had not seen any comments about this movie except that it was violent saw it on the small screenfirst impressionslovely music to start it off shocking violence the setting out of the movie into chapter headings with narration  thats coolthen some surprisingly amusing pauses inserted into violent scenes little girl comes home from school very funny visual gags sunglasses hand luggage on a plane sniggering nowthese humorous touches and the cartoony nature of some scenes help the viewer to take a different view of the violence somehow very clever still watching at home i could fast forward through some of the fighting scenes not because the violence is too violent  bloody but because it goes on so long it gets boring maybe this is clever too maybe im supposed to become bored by the violence and maybe this says something about me or maybe its simply boringthe black and white sequence probably helped in averting the tedium in fact helped avoid toomuchred fatigue perhapsand then i was disappointed that the story had no ending or that the film ended before the story ended but duh its volume 1but i disagree with some commentators who said it was emotion free there is some desperate emotion portrayed very powerfully by the lead part and moments of respect and even tenderness between combatantsconclusion surprisingly enjoyable even for someone who doesnt like violence funny cool entertaining fight scenes which become tedious after a while not emotion free has a clear storyline which doesnt conclude what its finished left me wanting more,cruel
i think a lot of people misunderstood for a actiondrama but what it really is is a black comedy that uses elements of action drama  martial arts tarantino has built in several great references to 70s martial arts films as well as some spaghetti western  a brilliant brain depalma scene as a note this film has some of the most inventive  brilliant cinematography ever seen on film as far as the mechanics of the film goes it even beets pulp fiction  now for the the acting this is an excellent role for uma it seems that trantino always brings out the best in her though her role as mia in pulp is far better lucy liu shows some great talent as the exceedingly evil orenishiivivia a fox is average in role as vernita green madsen  carradine are both equally good in small roles in the first part but the role that stood out more than the others is that of dyrrel hannah a elle driver in this pat she only has a brief cameo but she should have got an oscar for the part 2sonny chiba is excellent in his small but crucial role as hattori hanzothe sound track is great especially the bangbang song in the opening credits people are often outraged at pulp only winning one oscar kb should have won 5 best actress in a leading roleuma thurmanbest actress in a supporting roleeither lucy or dyrell best director best song  best cinematographya solid 810 from me,cruel
quentin tarantino is a legend in film making the first time i saw i was shocked i didnt expect this movie to be as good as his previous efforts but personally i think he perfected his film making he pushed himself to his limits and it paid off after watching it several times it doesnt get any more dull it is simply the most entertaining movie ive ever seen the action the comedy the thrills the action  the action they all add up to one of the best movies ever created some of the scenes in never seize to amaze me how tarantino came up with the ideas for some camera angles  movements is beyond me all throughout the movie are little ideas probably created on set which make the film even more enjoyable  the dialogue includedthe acting was great uma thurman holds the movie on her shoulders along with tarantino she did a fabulous job playing the bride  it was defiantly a challenging role for her but you could tell she had studied every angle possible for the character and aced it great performance by her the rest of the actors do a great job i loved every performancetheres so much to write about this film i could give a detailed description of every scene but instead of doing that ill summarise what i think of this film in one quick sentenceabsolutely ing amazing see it now 1010,cruel
vol 1  2 is at first sight a great action movie i like it very very much from the first to the last frame i like everything from the score to the actors from the story to the way it is deconstructed from its humor to its worse explosions of violence from its beautiful bw sequences to the cartoons  la manga with its own way to mix different flavors cultures and origins is one of my favorites ever definitely a great film a milestone in cinema history there is no need for another reason to love theres another one though  is a beautiful wonderful almost perfect touching sincere desperate love letter from quentin tarantino to uma thurman just try to find a single frame that doesnt depict my actress as he calls her since 1994 as beautiful desirable strong indestructible sexy attractive smart childlovingwho would resist ,cruel
though bloody and violent on an unimaginable scale there is nothing serious or realistic about this film but who says a movie has to be serious or realistic or funny proves that sometimes all you need is an imaginative idea lots of beautifullychoreographed stunts and martial arts action and an impressive dose of cinematography and visual effects to make a brilliant entertaining piece of art a twisting and twisted plot and constant action will take you on a wild ride that you wouldnt think possible from a moving image on a movie screen my recommendation have an open mind pick up the dvds volume 1 and 2 set aside an evening and see them together and do yourself a favor dont shortchange the experience if you dont have a bigscreen tv or a home theater watch it at a friends house who does watching it on an ordinary little tv just doesnt allow you to experience the movie for what it is turn on the bigscreen and the surround sound turn down the lights microwave some popcorn clear your mind and enjoy it really is a wild ride,cruel
after the enormous critical and commercial success earned by reservoir dogs and pulp fiction director quentin tarantino found himself in the desired position of being able to do literally anything he wanted so after the commercial failure of the underrated gem jackie brown back in 1997 he spent 6 years preparing what would be his ultimate tribute to the 70s and the films he loves so much is the name of the movie where tarantino shows off everything he admires of cinema while telling the story of a nameless character created by uma thurman in a simple story of revenge spiced up by a retro 70s imagery and countless of references to classic movies at its core its a very stylized action film but is also an ode to those films westerns crime and martial arts films mainly that gave fun to mr tarantino when he was a young ladas written above the plot is actually very simple four years after being attacked during her wedding by her former teammates a former professional assassin codenamed black mamba uma thurman awakes from a coma discovering that everyone at the chapel that day including her unborn baby have been murdered decided to take revenge on those who ruined her life the black mamba now the bride makes a list of the ones that attacked her that day and starts her quest hunting for the members of the deadly viper assassination squad until she fins the leader her former boss and ex lover bill david carradinemany critics have called negatively a prime example of style over substance filmmaking but i think that those critics are missing the point in the end is not about if the bride succeeds or not but about how and what she does to achieve her goal and instead of being another exercise in storytelling this film is actually a very graphic love letter to 70s cinema complete with all its clichs and imagery from the kato masks to the samurai duels and from the hattori hanzo character played by sonny chiba to bruce lees yellow jumper is a gorgeous tribute to all those classic action films of olddespite being an overtly visual and stylish action film tarantinos strength has always being the dialogs and so he manages to make the simple story interesting by focusing on the details of the plot mainly the backstory of the characters developing the characters has always been an essential for tarantino and is not an exception its really this focus what gives the film heart making it to stand out among other films about violence as violence seems to be the theme of at least vol 1 while keeping the 70s tribute angle of the film crafted with a fastpacked style that looks like a stylized mixture of western and martial arts movie genres that flows smoothly never becoming boring or tiresomeuma thurman is really the force that drives the film and on her shoulders is the responsibility of the films success fortunately she manages to create a complex character that while very aggressive its still very feminine and really likable despite the fact that she is a cold blooded killing machine lucy liu delivers a lowkey performance as oren ishii former teammate of the bride and the main enemy in this chapter basically an antithesis of the bride oren is also quite complex in the sense that is a character that has made a lot of sacrifices to become a top assassin and head of the japanese mafia the final confrontation between the two is certainly the highlight of the film the rest of the cast is very effective although we dont see too much of them tarantino makes the wise move of focusing on the development of the two main characters only its nice to see sonny chiba gordon liu and kenji oba in cameos across the filmvol 1 is just the first part of the brides saga covering her awakening and the beginning of her revenge as well as the more actionoriented part of the saga it could also be said that this is the 70s martial arts tribute part of the story as vol 2 is situated in a slightly different context i even believe they were conceived as two films from the start although still a 70s tribute film that concludes the story overall the film is quite exiting although it probably wont be too attractive to people expecting a more complex and detailed story while the characters are very welldeveloped and the plot is rich in details the films focus is highly visual rather than plotdriven so people expecting an insightful film in this aspect or even people expecting similar film to reservoir dogs or jackie brown will be highly disappointedwhile personally i consider vol 2 a vastly superior movie vol 1 is an excellent action film that can stand on its own delivering great entertainment and fastpacked action in high doses as a beautifully done tribute to 70s cinema this movie excels 810,cruel
this evening i viewed this film for the first time and i must say i was quite engaged this film has much indepth irony where the bride uma thurman seeks revenge by making it her prerogative to murder bill david carradine her former boss because he murdered her and her unborn child allegedly her daughtertobe before she is able to avenge bill she must murder his subordinates oren ishii lucy liu vernita green vivica a fox and elle driver daryl hannah along the way towards achieving her goal the bride has yet to face many obstacles but as she endeavours through her journey we become educated of the other assassins personal histories tarantino also appeals to the academic where he places much emphasis on freuds theories of both the superego and of the id similar to the monster in shelleys frankenstien and to mr hyde in stevensons dr jekyll and mr hyde hegemonies based on various beliefs such as those of buddhists and those of samurais are also quite prevalent this film was well directed and is a mustsee for those who wish to broaden their understandings in sociology psychology international relations and various liberal arts related fields as well as for those who wish to enjoy an actionpacked movie night,cruel
if you didnt like this movie you are not the market it was shooting for this is a movie made to invoke a history of the grind house movies that guys in their late forties managed to spend most of their time in as kidsa story tied together with homage clips to different types of action movies some of the references were so small you have to ask yourself did he really intend to do thati thought the second movie was not as good but still an sevendont let anyone scare you away from this movie it was designed for a audience that gets it you will be surprised that you get it to,cruel
ok the version im giving a review of is the uncut japanese version which is better than the original theatrical cut the anime sequence is slightly longer  a bit more violent but the main difference is that when the bride takes on the crazy 88 at the house of the blue leaves its all left in colour with more limbs chopped off the whole sequence is pure movie heaven just like the film itself its certainly tarantinos best looking film thanks to director of photography robert richardson vol1 has a unique fantasy feel while vol2 looks like a western in the tradition of sergio leones once apon a time in the west comes to mind no doubt tarantino pays homage to that amongst many other films when you watch both vols back to back the way it should be seen it is a beautiful ultraviolent revenge epic you are truly transported into tarantinos movie world a special mention must go to uma thurman she holds the screen magnificently no matter how many films she does in the future will remain her best performance,cruel
well reading some other viewers comments and their dislike of this movie i have to say for its defense if you arent into shaw brother movieslonewolf and cubthe bride wore black etc dont watch this movie if you are you will have the fun of your life watching tarantino mixing up popular heroes sonny chiba as hattori hanzo from asian movies together with a dramaaction movie from the sixties the film starts not with warner bros but with shaw brothers which makes clear where this film is going to take you many quotes from different movies figures are placed into the movie for lovers to recognize same as the music using kinji fukasakus battles without honor and humanity or the title theme of lady snowblood  love song of carnage the violence is typically japanese style overdone for the comic factor you cant really take it serious anymore anybody who feels offended took it way to serious brilliant moviei loved itall actors had pure fun,cruel
a movie about revenge thats not something new but the way that quentin tarantino put a story around this oldest theme known to mankind is just amazing you see the first scene and think oh my god this cannot get any bloodier and then bam it can tarantino shows once again his genius as a director he has lots of fantastic and unique ideas about how a fight should look or how you can show a persons whole life without using three different actors and bringing at the same time the characters cultural backgroundand then there is uma thurman again she shows that she can play any role no matter if it is a professional killer or a maybe a character you would fall in love with she can do everything and you she makes you believe it a great movie you shouldnt miss but if you dont feel to well watching some people die and suffer and see millions of liters of blood then you should maybe rethink the decision of watching this very movie,cruel
we all know about quentin tarantino as a renowned director and writer for violent films including reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and again he uses his talents to create an engaging violent thrillernot as interesting as pulp fiction or jackie brown is more violent more fast flowing and contains more emotion than his previous filmsuma thurman pulp fiction stars as the central character who knows what she wants out of life and after awaking from a long coma goes in search of those who have betrayed herits a beautiful idea and creates excitement and anticipation at every corner however a lot of ideas used are blown out of complete proportion eg the opening scene and the crazy 88nevertheless i found the 88 scene was a remarkable piece of directing shot in black and white it is fast paced and creates an unbelievable amount of tensionthe use of flashbacks is a fantastic technique but might have been slightly overdone as many people i think may be slightly confusedthe japanese animation is the best part of the whole film  emotional brilliantly created and tense it creates passion that unfortunately lacks for the rest of the filmtarantino uses his violent knowledge to create some of the most graphic violent scenes in motion picture history and therefore allows audiences to see how dangerous the games the characters are playing how serious they arehad it none been for a few action scenes then this film would have been perfectit is definitely worth watching if you think you have the stomach for a film which is extremely violent exciting emotional and loyal710,cruel
this is the first quentin tarantinomovie i have seen and i love itthe story is basically about this woman who wakes up 4 years after she was supposed to be married of her coma back then she was pregnant but have lost everything and now she wants revenge on those people who betrayed her back thenand boy she does it good uma thurman does a great job and keeps you entertained the whole movie long who would have guessed that a movie about killing people could be so good i sure didnt and was vary skeptical when i first heard about this movie then they showed it on danish tv and then i have to see it when the movie stopped i felt it all was going to fast and was missing a lot how many movies is sow good that you forget about the time at the moment im just waiting to see vol 2 and just wanna see this one againif you can take vary violent scenes with a lot of blood you shouldnt miss this others dont see it you will probably not like it,cruel
this movie appears to be a backhanded slap at kung fu movies dating back to the 70s certainly a movie with a title like is not meant to be taken seriously but then the flick turns around and has large supplies of blood gore and mangled corpsesits the old story of a woman scorned but this woman happens to be a rambogovernatorbruce leejackie chanetc type of invincible killing machine she even dresses in one scene exactly like bruce lee did in one his movies uma thurman is appropriately vicious then emotional in her jekylhyde style role she exudes blind hatred and destructive fury one moment tearful sentimentality the next some of these characterizations are played too straight for the bride others are over the top this clumsy lack of consistency disorients the viewer are you supposed to fear her sympathize with her laugh at her campy and overstated persona theres a lot of oneliner banter between the bride and her adversaries and some are quite funny having two people who are in a lifeanddeath struggle mocking each other is an old clich ripe for satire but its done way too much it gets old after a whileas the title implies shes trying to exact revenge on the twisted sicko bill david carradine doing the evil psycho well her former lover who is a trained assassin like herself what he had done to her is one of the many contrivances of the film but its easy to overlook these and give the film whatever suspension of disbelief it asks of you the action is uncompromisingly violent antagonists are portrayed as mindless cold hearted killersheads are chopped off innocents are blasted mercilessly body parts get cut off sometimes pulled off and mangled this movie is not for everyone especially if you dislike dark humor or relentless violence many fight scenes although magnificently choreographed drag on way too long the reason this movie needed two volumes there are many scenes where the director stretches out twominutesworth of information into a 15minute scene the two volumes are usually shown backtoback so if youve got 4 hours plus commercial time with nothing better to do this wild mayhem isnt a bad way to spend the time,cruel

let me start of by saying this is one of my top five favorite movies in the worldthings it did wellthis movie had plenty of action to satisfy any hardcore watch a guy be split in half type guys it had very fluent fight scenes and even though this was the more bloody of the two volumes it still provided enough plot to give you an okay glance at what is actually happeningit had a flowing plot and because of how little information you get you are more apt to watch carefully which gives a better feel through the movie than just watching through a 30 minute dialog waiting for the next sword scenethe angle work in the cameras was different and closeups felt very retrothings this movie did poorly onthis movie is my favorite but if there were anything to say it could have done better would have been to make the plot more clear the the average viewer because of this most people either like it or hate it its that simple many of my friends left the theater not even knowing who bill was it didnt seem to appeal to a very large audienceall in all it is a great movie and differently worth buying,cruel
there should be a list of things quentin tarantino knows how to do and a list of things he clearly does not perhaps if he examined this list he wouldnt make any mistakes in the future the one thing tarantino should definitely not be doing is getting involved with any horror films hostel while not awful was talked up way too much and his endorsement for wolf creek i have no idea what he was on to make him think it was a stellar flickbut the list of things he can do well is much longer and we see most of those things in this is the story of a retired assassin who is attacked on her wedding day and the entire wedding party is killed when she wakes up from her coma she decides to take revenge on the man who did this to her bill yes she will or at least die tryingthings tarantino does very well 1 puts scenes in the wrong order in they dont even show her killing her enemies in the correct order he mastered this in pulp fiction after testing it in reservoir dogs but really drives home how effective a film can be if you put things in a more climatic order2 incidental dialog some people like richard linklater or kevin smith can make an entire film of incidental dialog thus making the dialog essential and not really incidental tarantino only puts a pinch here or there to flavor the film with offhand cultural references remember the royale with cheese from pulp fiction youll find more of that here3 senseless violence if you liked the killings in the other films youll love this the killing is gorier the body count higher and the influence of old kung fu films is a nice touch personally im a big fan of the blood geysers4 music selection music played a central role in reservoir dogs kbillys sounds of the 70s again the music is crucial giving the film an oldtimey feel with green hornet music among others this is very well done mixing the classic sword fighting with the modern guns5 putting people in suits i cant explain why but the suits worn in tarantino films are the best6 understanding your traditions this film references so many more old kung fu films tan i will ever see tarantino knows his stuff and sprinkles references all over that most people will never understand a prominent character hattori hanzo is actually a real character from other sources and even some of the dialog is a throwback this homage is touching and well donewhat im saying is that if you liked tarantino before i suspect youll be a big fan of this movie its dirtier gorier and more violent some scenes are much more crude than in his other films but quentin tarantino and uma thurman are a winning combination not to mention the flawless michael madsen and a wellcasted david carradine,cruel
postmodern is a daft concept used by pseudo intellectuals when describing dull films by other pseudo intellectuals is not post modern its few filmic jokes are there because they work not because they reference something its obvious hyper reality is coupled with some intensely emotional moments that work because of the brilliance of the actress tarantino has employed to star in this violent opera and because of whichever brilliant anime artist he got to direct the superb animated sequence of the film it is clear that irrespective of hong kong  anime  karate film subject and action this film owes its greatest debt to sergio leone and it is high praise indeed when i say that this film not only captures the stylish extremes and beauties of once upon a time in the west it may even surpass them as with previous films tarantino subverts linearity this is once again in order to fabricate a hollywood narrative not to be arty or postmodern or pseudo intellectual its done cos we dumb audiences like an emotional beginning middle and end so reviewers for gods sake take note tarantino chapters his film cos its cool not cos its arty he moves backwards and forwards in time cos its cool and he needs to not cos its arty he references other films cos its cool and it works not cos its arty this film works its cool and its an intense exciting moving operatic finely crafted masterpiece,cruel
just like tarantinos previous few movies has been divided into chapters that relay a small portion of the overall movie to the greatest detail but for volume1 it all ends there and theres little more in common with other of tarantino movies a lot of people may question his style of movie making but im glad that tarantino has decided to try something new and prove that he knows what hes doing for sure if you want a more traditional tarantino flick then watch volume2 if you want style action gore and an out of control fun fest that has been brilliantly implemented then watch volume1 every scene or every chapter of this movie irrespective of it having the advertised action or not is extremely memorable what you cannot expect from this experiment in movie making is the actual story and connected explanation of events which are done only in the second volume,cruel
another top 10 movie another quentin tarantino movie another movie with samurai swordstarantino was said to have created this story with uma thurman in mind and she fit perfectly she did a great job as the femme fatal in search of revenge this movie certainly has more fight scenes than dialog and they are very well donethis movie pays homage to great samurai sagas 70s kung fu movies and one of my favorite scenes which was a wonderful example of japanese action animeand again good guy  bad guy movies are only great when the bad guys are well done and all the bad guys in this movie are so good it is almost a shame to see them demise in fact michael madsen is afraid he will only keep getting bad guy parts this movie also brought david carradine back from obscuritythis is one of my top 10 movies and should be higher on the all time list 2 is also very good but not as good as 1,cruel
plot outline the bride who was once the deadliest assassin of the deadly viper assassination squad until the day she decided to leave the business assume a new identity and get married but it was on the day of her marriage that her old friends  oren ishii lucy liu vernita green vivica a fox budd michael madsen and elle driver daryl hannah and her boss bill decided to crash the wedding killing everyone thereand putting a gun to the brides head however she did not die she is just in a coma and is about to wake up and travel to tokyo japan and begin her revenge on the five people apart of the team that the bride herself was once apart of vol 1 is about a young woman bent on revenge but its also about the screen return of quentin tarentino the most outrageous american filmmakers working today and one of my favorites working today may be a stretch because bill is his first film in over five years since 1997s jackie brown and it certainly looks like qt has been hard at work filling every scene of bill with meticulous detail and overdirecting in his manic style the writerdirector again shows a lack of cinematic originality while maintaining his genius for actionpacked 1970s japanese style violence and entertainmentis a lot of fun hardly a dull moment goes by but that underlines the obvious fact that the film is all surface full of gunfights boffo martial arts sequences and with virtually nothing to think about its the proverbial assault on the senses as youre given a queasy stomach to get you going before tarentino graduates to repulsion through sight sound smell and even tastethe performance by uma thurman is fierce she is a beautiful and an extremely talented actress lucy liu and the rest of the supporting cast also give in sharp performancesoverall vol 1 is easily one of my favorite films of 2003 and its also responsible for making me a devoted tarentino fan no i hadnt seen pulp fiction before this the film is a grind house of sharp dialouge set design and over the top gore which is done so magically and put together perfectly a true classic1010see it if you like pulp fiction jackie brown and fight clubluke rowe,cruel

one of these days im going to cut you into little pieces pink floyd one of these days meddle 1971i have often written in some reviews on this site that i wasnt a big fan of quentin tarantino a cinemagoing filmmaker with a mindboggling culture its true that i have never been very taken with pulp fiction 1994 as for vol 1 i had deemed it as violent and hollow i maintain the first epithet but i jettison the second one now i watched it again last saturday night with its other brother vol 2 that i hadnt seen before and i changed my mind about it i realized that i had overlooked it and i would go as far as saying that i found it much better than tarantino 1994 filmthe staple story doesnt carry much weight a wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the bride who spends four years in a coma when she wakes up shes got one sole word in her mind revenge on a scrap of paper she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all she also keeps the best for the end bill this story is for tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons comic strip spaghetti western samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences and animated by a cinema passion the filmmaker couldnt resist to the desire to include filmloving details throughout the brides adventures thus the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well the bride wore blood its of course a hint at franois truffauts film la marie etait en noir 1968 a film on which truffaut himself didnt have a warm spot i have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and tarantino isnt afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous effortsthe technical command of vol 1 leaves speechless first i would like to congratulate tarantino for the cinematography he tapped it enhances bright colors especially the red and one thing i noticed in the first sequence of the film uma thurman drives a vehicle with red seats in jeanluc godards pierrot le fou 1965 the red is also a dominating color in one scene jean paul belmondo and anna karina are in a car with red seats if i dont understand at all the symbolical function of the red in godards highbrow work in tarantinos work his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the brides motivations red is revenge violence deaththis revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance its tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but its necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona and throughout these chapters tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions to pay homage to the samurai film among others and the contents thus one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments the scene when the brie kills some 80 masked enemies tarantino borrowed a device from hitchcock he used in his mindboggling psycho 1960 to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood besides and while im on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate even outclass the ones of the matrix saga and as many film buffs know it one of tarantinos recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence for vol 1 he didnt shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun thrillseekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the bride before facing lucy liu declares to them dont try to get back your missing partstarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the japanese man who sells to the bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window the one whom the bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list you guessed who it is of course or when the bride tries to move her big toe after her comaits exciting cinema as one could wish and for tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up he delivered the goods to spend a truly great cinema moment the different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity what about my judgment of the volume 2 the answer in my review about itnb theres perhaps this unlikeliness in tarantinos scenario when the bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again but during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure why dont they find her again after such a long time its a minor detail,cruel
while i wouldnt really want to go and try flaws in this movie any attempt to do so would be really difficult besides the complaints that tarantino ripped off somebody else the formula has been perfect to separate the story from the movie completely and set it aside for the sequel but even after having done so and having delivered nonstop bloody action this movie really does not seem so commercial even when it comes to scenes with no action at all the dialog is excellent and the sequences are gripping even if one imagines that tarantino payed too much homage to others by using their ideas the movie as an overall effort comes out as highly original,cruel
stars uma thurman david carradine lucy lui vivica a fox darryl hannah michael bowen julie dreyfus michael madsen and michael parksquentin tarantino is one of the most talented writers and directors out there with this he showed off his directing talents however the writing was almost nothing this has less than half classic tarantino dialogue and its mostly consisting of strong bloody violence this was a well done film and many like it better than the much superior in my opinion 2 it was nice though to see tarantino regular actors uma thurman michael bowen from jackie brown michael madsen and michael parks i recommend this but its just a bit too flashy and not enough substance to keep it fully afloatmy rating  out of  113 mins rated r for violence language and some sexual dialogue,cruel
vol1 is another great movie directed by tarantinoim a tarantinos fan and my favorite movies directed by him are pulp fiction and jackie brownvol1 is a very fun movie with great scenes and momentsbut i didnt find this movie excellentone of the reasons of that is thatthe film was cut and the following things are seen on volume 2miramax didnt want to release a 4 hour movie so the movie is cutthe ending isnt good because its cutthe real ending is on vol2the movie hasnt got an original storybut the execution is originalvol1 is a good and very fun movie that i recommend,cruel
it is one of the few movies that one can see repeatedly and still enjoy unfortunately 1 only lasted for less than a week in cinemas in my area while they never gave a reason it will likely that the violence was too much for them finally ended up seeing it on tv much later after that it was an extremely big regret that i did not see this masterpiece in the cinema theatre quentin tarantino veers from his traditional formulae and proves that his a great director and writer through delivering a movie that everyone could like as long as they dont find it too violent or offensive this has to be the most stylish movie ever made completely stripped of the underlying story and using only subplots is an out of control rampage that will leave you dizzy and begging for more dont expect the same thing from the sequel though also dont confuse obvious and open homages with ripping off,cruel
script might not be fantastic what with people calling each other squares i little reference to pulp fictionbut the action is pretty beautiful uma starts rolling around and cutting up ankles and theres sum crazy japanese girl with a mace and she stabs sum paedophile cunt in the chest and says looks like youve been penetratedit was also nice 2 see martial arts legend sonny chiba get a part not quite so sure about daryl hannah she has disgusting hands shame volume two doesnt live up to this masterpiece i have a lot of time for quentin tarantino and some say he is violent for the sake of it all i have to say to them is grow up you pussy,cruel
very cool  very chic  very watchable u can like others go on about storyline  plot  blood  watch 70s hong kongchinese cinema and two films called lady snowblood  blizzard from the netherworld and love song of venegeance  which quentin mentions in the dvd extras and you will find if anything it is toned down and the black and white sequence and the silhouetted worked well at giving it that period feel and got some scenes through the censorthis was a cool film to be watched and enjoyed at an adult cartoon level and works perfectlyi have come to this film late and am about to watch the sequel and i have watched the dvd version  and it is worth buyingwatching for the making of film too  if only to get the enthusiasm of both uma and quentin,cruel
it took about six years for us to hear anything from the brilliant directorwriter quentin tarantino then in the year 2003 we finally got him back with the amazing vol 1 the movie is a combination of yakuzasamuraitriad movies what the good old tarantino so much adoresvol 1 is a story of bride uma thurman who is attacked by his former boss bill david carradine on her wedding day after being in coma for four years the bride wakes up and she has a vengeance on her mind bride works trough highly trained employees for example daryl hannah michael madsen etc to finally the film would have been over three hours long if tarantino had decided to cut it in two pieces in result the two parts work as they are tarantino has planned to make also one whole movie about the film was very fun to make uma thurman has said that kicking ass is ridiculously satisfying i have heard that the old violence lover tarantino had a fantasy about thurman killing people for real maybe that would had gone too far the realistic action and killing is enough in the embodiment of fantasy and imaginationas usually tarantinos dialog is rich and intriguing he is a hell of a story teller whos mind is pure genius you can tell that he has had certain actors on his mind while writing the script uma thurman fits in the part of the bride excellently once again a couple of tarantinos favorites michael madsen and samuel l jackson have got a little parts in the film the result is very satisfying indeedmay seem to be cruel and crude but inside burns the various flames of feelings once again love is a powerful thing you can see it burning while watching the filmif you see vol1 you must see also vol2 because the first part isnt anything without the ending even if the part one is a bit better than its sequel,cruel
what a movie what a director tarantino is the best in my opinion this is without a doubt the best quentin tarantinos movieonly a genius would be capable of mixing in the same movie genres so different and distant as the westerns and the martial arts movies now ill give valuable informations for those who havent seen the movie yet you shouldnt be only waiting for excellent shots and amazing breath taking fight scenes as a tarantino movie voli and volii has a great plot and brilliant interpretations by uma thurman david carradine and the rest of the cast a huge movie its one must see,cruel
i was just at the local video club renting some movies and as i was looking around my eye caught vol1 i took it and went home to watch and i cant stress enough how much i enjoyed it in fact after it ended i called some friends to watch it with metarantino does an excellent job as the director giving the film an excellent tone the lead uma therman does a wonderful job portraying the bride both on acting and fighting and of course i couldnt just forget about the music it is used skillfully and i knew it was going to be a great movie from the first songthe reason i give it a 9 out of 10 is because the use of blood is way off hand at some points especially during the anime part,cruel
to start the main point of this is to say wow what a fantastic film its entertainment at its best no doubt to be honest before this movie i had never heard of quentin tarantino but i was young so i hope that you forgive me this wonderfully looking film got me hooked on the drug i like to call qt the action is great and is a fantastic homage to japanese films of the past the dialogue at least the way it is put together is original the acting is very good especially for a film like this and the action is well you guessed it awesome this is one of those movies that you watch over and over and over again and it truly never dulls down from the first time you saw it as usual with tarantino the soundtrack is great and the reason i like it so much is because it strays far away from the first three tarantino movies hell even the second volume of tarantino proves that he can make any type of film this has great comedy great cinematography and a spectacular anime sequence that by itself would make an awesome short movie so many spinoffs of this movie could be made in the future but i sadly believe that it will not happen oh well i guess ill just have to enjoy this to the fullest next time i watch it and the next time and the next time and you get the point,cruel
what i liked about vol 1 was that it was really modern movie that paid homage to many of the great tv and movies of the past 4 decades the color was fantastic and beautiful and actors and their characters played out superbly yeah i have to give it to tarantino no one can make a movie like this good or bad other than him id say that good far out weighed the bad in this case and i hope hed make more movies like this one that defy hollywood stereotypes hes not narrow in the way many american film makers are in that they can only play up a drama in a cook book sort of a fashion his taste in cinematography is also very different from other hollywood directors i would hazard to guess that if a student made a movie like this in art schools they would be berated very badly if i like tarantino its for these reasons the stuffs thats good and fun that are getting forgotten these days is abundant in his movie making tastenow for the ridiculous antics first of all you can never use a japanese sword the way uma thurman did samurais sword is made of steel core and iron blade for this reason the blade part chips very badly when it hits a hard object like human bones this is the reason why the samurai always carries a shorter spare with the main katana no way you can kill 100 people without devastating the sword way uma did made by hattori hanzo or not secondly japanese yakuzas carry guns these days no one carries a samurai sword so this is the purely fiction part of the movie uma would have been gunned down in five seconds in a real situation thirdly theres no tea house like the house of blue leaves in japan the architecture simply isnt japanese its clear that the set was in chinathats my take on this movie dont get me wrong i thought this was a great movie and i wish more movies made were fun to watch as this one was,cruel
movies cant get any better than this this movie has it all good action blood great story and good actingyes the blood is not that realistic i mean how can someone have a fountain of blood coming out of their hand and remain alive but of course unrealistic movies can still be great for example take lord of the rings star wars or the matrix those movies were much more unrealistic than this is and still theyre in the top 250 of imdbacting was incredible uma thurman vivica a fox and lucy lui couldnt have been more perfect the supporting actors like julie dreyfus chiaki kuriyama and sonny chiba were awesome as wellwithout the music this movie wouldnt have been in the top 250 trust me the music supervisor or whatever they call him did an awesome job they fit every part exactly and the beat keeps going on in your head for example when beatrix was talking to sofie in her trunk telling her the second reason why she kept her alive that music was awesome and it made me shiveri firmly believe that everyone who watched it liked something it had everything if you like action it was full of it if you like blood theres a lot if you like cartoons theres like 10 minutes of it its still great trust me if you like thrillers there will be a couple of surprises if you like dramatic movies youll like the story if you like comedy it contains a bit of humor every now and then so you must have liked somethingfor me this is much better than the second one this sets the mythology of the story while the second answers everything this one had more action and blood than the other the only real action part in the second one was the fight against daryl hannah in my opinion this is the best movie ever made and you just have to watch it,cruel
short and to the point like a hanzo swordpros great actors great acting directed by q tarrantino full of action nice story and different in a good waycons umwhat were we talking about action flick inspired from martial arts movies watah adventure lets get out of here suspense get down more of the suspense get down again a good movie to watch so watch ityou wont regret itwell only if you dont like action martial arts and a heroinea female hero not the drug,cruel
vol 1 is a hyperviolent hypergory kongfur grindhouse flick and theres nothing at all wrong with thatcenters on an assassin named only as the bride uma thurman who was shot in the head on her wedding day by the mysterious bill four years later the bride wakes from a coma to find out shes not only lost four years of her life but also her child she was pregnant at the time of the shooting so she sets off in her quest for revenge her quest to but before she can get to bill the bride must first get through bills deadly viper assassination squad lucy lui vivica a fox daryl hannah and michael madsen let the body count beginso as the bride exacts her revenge on anyone that gets in her way we quickly realize that vol 1 is a movie made by tarantino for tarantino you get the feeling that what hes saying with this film is if you dont like the huberviolence and megablood than fudge you because i do body parts fly across the screen with glee buckets of blood spurt out of body stumps and heads roll literally all over the film my rule of thumb lots of blood something to watch and enjoy or laugh too ya watch this,cruel

vol1 is a film that contains many emotions all of which play an important role at some point in the movie it is an action film at its core but it has some very tender momentswe see a woman whom we know nothing about but in the next hour and 50 minutes we will connect with her we will become entangled in her story of brutal vengeance and we will root for her when the bride wakes up from her 4yearlong coma right off the bat we know that she has lost something very valuable a child we know this because she grabs her stomach the moment she wakes up and begins to weep because what was inside of her when she was shot is now gone the scene truly captures the feeling of loss and moves the film right along storywisethe bride is in a situation she discovers that she is pregnant and runs off when i say runs off i mean that she is running away from both a life and a man of murder she is an assassin employed by a dangerous killer by the name of bill and part of the deadly viper assassination squad she runs to el paso meets a nice guy and they plan to marry but on her wedding day she is visited by the squad everyone is slain except for herself and now that shes awake shes going to get her revenge on all 5 of themshe knocks 2 of them right off in the first film vernita green and oren ishii in the first of the two films many questions are asked who is bill what are to become of the remaining 3 what is the brides real name and when she finally makes her way to bill what will happenbut in the meantime there are many things to marvel about the great swordplay one of the biggest and bloodiest brawls in movie history and the sheer level of fun and depth and thats only the first halfvol1 is pure excitement,cruel
when i started telling my friends how much i fell in love with the hills have eyes remakes blood and gore they turned me toward this movie which is now one of my favorites uma thurman perfectly plays the bride and i guess had a lot of fitness training since i just saw them back to back i would have to say the 1st movie is better then the second only because there is 1000x more blood and it seemed a little more entertaining there is a lot of koolaid like blood because this movie wasnt meant to be gruesome but still bloody i definetnly have to applause quentin tarantino for doing an excellent original story with the funky soundtrack and bizzar directing and camera angles if you go to see blood see the 1st one because it definitely tops the first and to me seems a lot more interestingfor a 1010 interesting blood fest go see the 2003 thriller ,cruel
this movie is flippin awesome uma thurman is like the best actress on the planet and it shows quentin tarantino is the best director on earth by far he directed pulp fiction for goodness sake the fight sequences are so incredibly worked out and the way he uses the black and white to make it less gory is so cool beatrix goes and tries to kill all the members of the divas of which she was a former member and most of all their leader bill because he impregnated her and tried to kill her the script is so well written and the story of the second one is even better check out my review of vol 2 i read that they had to break it up into two movies because the film company couldnt put a 3hr 15min flick on the market but volume one has so much action and incredible acting i dont know why it wasnt up for more awards,cruel

i just watched 1  2 backtoback first viewing gotta tell ya folks i found it a little boring i think its too long and could easily have been one film i dont think the films can be considered separately 2 is not a sequel it is simply a continuation of the film much like matrix reloaded and matrix revolutions cannot be considered separately nor any part of the lord of the rings neither part stands alone is obviously an homage to hong kong lungfu films in which realism does not necessarily play a part eg gravity take for example the cruel tutelage of pai mei there was also a bit too much monty pythonesque spraying blood for me but okay if those sorts of things dont bother you then its no problem the movies are certainly beautiful and the cinematography is excellent certainly up to the standards we have come to expect from tarantino there are many excellent scenes and overall the plot is pretty good there are however several scenes that are just too long too overblown and frankly to dull there are also a few scenes that could have been completely cut out as they add nothing to the film eg the scene where michael madsen goes to work at the topless bar what was that all about there were other scenes that were included that i found not important and not all that interesting like the scene in 2 with esteban i almost found the animation segment substandard it couldshould have been much better while watching these films i got the impression that maybe tarantino has been reading too much of his own press i found reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown all to be better films the arent bad but i would disagree with anyone who says that they are quentins best work just my opinion,cruel
quentin tarantino has arrived to a point in his career where he can simply do anything he wants and gets away with it too and by all means he has earned that right he went from a modest videoclerk with a love for comic books to one of the most versatile filmmakers ever to walk the face of this earth i simply wont be told otherwise he knows movies the classics and the junk and he knows how to make one i wont even go into the story or the visuals nor wont i go into the things i really liked or point out where he got his ideas and which films he pays homage to or makes fun of i wont list the different genres this movie blends in the mix but there are a lot and ill only tell that he also uses japanese anime for one chapter which can compete with the best manga out there in terms of drawings and motion and i will not talk about the flaws the saga has yes there are flaws and i will see to them in my vol 2 commenti will just say vol 1 is a mustsee thrill ride which perfectly portrays exaggerates and perfects tarantinos style of filmmaking that ive come to love over the years this is tarantinos ultimate take on the revengeflicktheme and he makes sure this subgenre rises to new solitary heights as to the complaint of some viewers who state that a lot of events in are illogical and unrealistic i can only say one thing this is a movie created in an environment free from limitations and as a cinematographic experience it pushes the boundaries of modernday filmmaking therefore it is by definition granted the defiance of logic for being bound by logic restrains oneself from pushing boundaries and you can quote me on that ill leave it at that or maybe one more important thing i recommend seeing the two volumes the whole experience in one take perhaps with one cigarettebreak in between like it was intended why ill explain in my comment for kb vol 2,cruel
uma thurman plays the bride a girl that was shot by bill and wants revenge vol 1 is one of those movies that are just fun to watch its got action violence more action more violence and maybe some other stuff toothe scene where the bride kills all the crazy 88 is a great scene bloods flying everywhere while shes cutting off arms legs heads and hands then the bride battles oren ishi the first on her list to die you have to watch this movie only a guy that doesnt like good movies would dislike this masterpiece i give volume 1 a 910 i love this movie,cruel
one night i was in a dorm room of my friends i was there to do something quick but since he wasnt in the room i decided to try out his entertainment system deciding on which dvd to put in i chose this one and when the movie startsbam you are off in a totally alternate world with one of taratinos finest everything about this movie is a lot different from all the other movies  everything about this film just seems so postmodern i can tell not only from when this movie was made but when i was a junior in high school my final project of the year in my english class of the time was to make a postmodern novel using various objects like a scrapbook you see this is what this movie is likei think if you are a huge fan of action movies and dvds and if you understand the whole postmodern thing very well then the movies are right for you i have yet to watch volume 2,cruel
this bloody action packed movie is by far the best action movie ever made not only does this movie have people with samurai swords hacking through everything its storyline is so in depth and perfect that is makes it the best the plot follows a women who worked as an assassin for a man she also fell in love with when she was pregnant with her child she left him and tried to start a normal life bill didnt accept that and killed all her friends and shot her in the head desperate for revenge on her dead daughter she wants to kill all the cunts and dicks who did this to her making her final decision she created a death list making sure she crossed out every name uma thurman is an amazing actress the look on her face when she sees her enemies is insane i finish this off as the best movie ever by the best director ever quentin tarantino,cruel
the mistake that i found is when she introducesnarrates oren into the story she says the woman to her right is her assistant well in fact oren is facing the camera so if u were to be in her shoes she would be to her left watch it and see for urself she actually says shes on her right side in fact shes on her left comment please i dont know why we have to write 10 lines what if you dont have all that much to say its ludicrous im just taking up time so i can post my comment im 15 and very into action movies i enjoy walks on the beach lol jk maximum of 1000 words minimum of 10 lines see guidelines for detailsyour comment is not yet ready for submission,cruel
when i saw this movie in the theater and it opened with the cheesy 70s style intros i knew this was gonna be an extraordinary movie this is a movie i watch over and over again because it is so incredibly entertaining for me this is a movie for those who love kung fu movies its not required but i think that a lot of the nuances would be missed if dont dig kung fu classics like enter the dragon or master of the flying guillotine quinten and uma deserve high praise for this film this movie i felt truly harnessed umas tremendous talent because for once she wasnt cast a a piece of window dressing she was undoubtedly a bmf in this movie and i believe is right up there with jules and dirty harry as all time great bmfs also not to diminish her but i think uma was never more beautiful than in this movie because she was allowed to show off her natural beauty as for quinteni felt that this movie was in part a middle finger to the hollywood giant and that is a very good thing you can tell the amount of love that went into this movie because its oozing off of every single frame of film,cruel
quentin terintinos newest installment to his collection is vol 1 of 2 the story of a pregnant bride uma thurman shot during her wedding by the viper assassination squad sent by a man named bill it only happens that the victim of this assassination was a former memberthe current story current is used loosely seeing as how the movie jumps from past to present simultaneously picks up when we see the bride laying in a hospital bed in a coma she wakes up and vows to kill all four of the four of the members who helped kill her then to the man who put a bullet to her headthe four viper members are played by lucy liu oren ishii vivica a fox vernita green daryl hannah elle driver and michael madsen budd now dont come to the theater expecting something different from terintino you will be sadly mistaken but for those who werent congratulations you came to see the right movie has that same vibe from pulp fiction with more action and lots more blood seriously a lot more bloodthe movie has plenty of drama and slow moments as well to balance out the film which is nice but after every action scene you find yourself laughing and screaming more and thank god terintino threw in that awesome soundtrack because even the greatest script needs musicif a retro yet modern action packed movie with good acting and sweet music is what you need then most might say you to see 8 great stars out of 10,cruel
volume 1 is a film thats all about style style violence and pure entertainment some call it gratuitously violent some call it disgusting some call it styleoversubstancei call it magnificentthe film follows a woman known simply as the bride thurman her real name is never revealed an expert assassin who while pregnant was left for dead at her wedding by her criminal employer bill carradine after her former um coworkers massacred her entire wedding party well four years later she wakes up from a coma as a situation that is as amusing as it is disgusting and brutal arises i wont spoil it for you and upon discovering that she has lost her baby becomes enraged and embarks on an epic odyssey of bloody revengein classic tarantino form the film is presented out of order but as always for him it works wonderfully volume 1 also exhibits another trait that is signature tarantino its packed to the brim with homages while many may complain about this and say that tarantino is nothing but a flamboyant plagiarist it is what he does and he does it well very wellanother gripe many people seem to have with the film is that it is overly violent repulsively so this seems to have been a popular complaint also with tarantinos first two films reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and while i believe those two films have more of a violent reputation than actual violence volume 1 really is extremely violent however it is not gritty or realistic violence meant to be taken seriously but comically overthetop violence in the style of the kung fu and samurai films of 70s replete with gallons of squirting blood and plenty of flying limbsanother pervasive complaint is that the film suffers from a severe case of styleoversubstance but as i stated in the first sentence of this review volume 1 is all about style its what makes the film such a joy to watch quentin tarantino works the camera and breezes through scenes so expertly and effortlessly that one cant help but keep their eyes glued to the screen also this complaint is rendered obsolete once one has viewed the second volume of this epic saga which really fleshes out the characters and adds meat to the bone but im not reviewing that filmanother talent tarantino has is extracting a spectacular performance from his actors and volume 1 is no exception uma thurman is simply outstanding especially in volume 2 but again im reviewing volume 1 david carradine delivers such a menacing and exuberant performance as the elusive bill and we never even see his faceand of course how could i forget quentins marvelous dialogue it has always been his strongest point and volume 1 finds him in top pop culture form allow me to quote one of my favorite exchanges from the film oren ishii you didnt really think it was going to be that easy did you the bride you know for a second there yeah i kinda did oren ishii silly rabbit the bride trix are for the bride and oren ishii kids its just so selfconsciously tongueincheek and joyous that its damn near impossible not to fall in love with itall this being said volume 1 is not a film for everyone if youre a fan of such films as sin city ichi the killer or any kind of classic kung fu movie then youll most likely love this modern masterpiece but if such films rape kill and then shoot your value system in the head just for good measure than you should probably avoid this one910,cruel
volume 1 directed by the epitome of cool quentin tarantino is a fantastic actionpacked movie the soundtrack is awesome the fight scenes stunning and the acting is superb from the entire castfollows the brides uma thurman story of revenge gunned down at her wedding by her former workmates she has now created a death list five this movie focuses on the first two cottonmouth lucy liu and copperhead vivica a fox in typical qt style we flash back and forth gathering information about the bride and her former workmates in particular cottonmouthis just a freakin outstanding movie not as good as qts pulp fiction but still a damn good movie uma thurman delivers an outstanding performance although we dont know a lot about her she is still manages to make us feel for her the soundtrack is probably one of the best i have ever heard however tthe dialogue isnt as witty and memorable as his dialogue from pulp fiction or reservoir dogs which is a little disappointing but the action scenes are exceptional a great throwback to old kungfu flicks which we would expect from qt55,cruel
i admit i was very determined to not like i am not a quentin tarantino fan by any means his film making is egotistical and annoying and he works far too hard to make the film unique original and usually confusing but the general public seems to like his films for his gratuitous violence and pointless everything else that is taboo nonetheless he manages to mainstream his film enough to make a decent action movie that the film goers loved so i went into this film expecting very little and it was awesome first of all someone else i am not a fan of uma thurman but she turns in a brilliant performance and likely a lasting classic film character in the bride the film is all about simple horrible blood thirsty revenge the simplistic plot makes the film easy to watch despite tarantinos directing style which still shows through the entire main cast really creates lasting characters for film history not only does thurman turn in a blood thirsty disturbing role as the bride but we have her main adversary oren ishii played by lucy liu who up until now has also never turned in an impressive role so its fair to say that if anything tarantino brings out the best in sub par actors the opening battle between the bride and vernita green set the tone for what is about although not a lot of plot has been given about their backgrounds or the circumstances of the brides attempted murder enough is given to keep it interesting we are also introduced to some of the future battles and characters that will be covered in volume two and they were interesting enough to make you want to know whats going to happenstrangely enough the worst and best part of this film is tarantinos direction his positive unique style comes through in the incredible choreography of the battles the intense over the top violence and the less than credible bloody scenes that seem so unrealistic that its meant to be that way at the same time you are bombarded with tarantinos forced uniqueness the scenes made from japanimation the annoyingly jumpy plot line and the oddball small little admissions which may or may not be explained away in the second volume i have yet to see no matter what anyone who wants a simple hack fest with loads of blood and over exaggerating violent scenes this one is worth seeing plus it will be a cinema classic no matter what looking forward to volume 2 8510,cruel
tarantinos brutally violent homage to kungfu and samurai films is a bit overrated in my eyes when i told my friend who is in love with this film that i enjoyed it but not to the point of worship like him he got mad well i thought this film was powerful sure was entertaining and had very good writing and acting now to the bad parts thought it was too violent a bit redundant with battle scenes got bored actually at times i thought uma thurman did a hell of a job very good acting as did madsen in his small role im not a big fan of lucy liu but i thought vivica a fox was decent the main reason i probably didnt like this film is because i dont like kungfu movies for the msot part or most karate fighting films with jet lijackie chan etc however i thought zwicks the last samurai was much more engaging than this maybe thats just my style anyhow it was entertaining and had some good acting and tarantinos writing was evident 810,cruel
i borrowed vol 1 from a friend because i actually wanted to see how good the movie really was before i saw it i really had no interest in the movie because im really not a big fan of samurai movies but since it was directed by quentin tarantino who directed and wrote one of my two favorite movies pulp fiction reservoir dogs i still had hopes for it good movie indeed and uma thurman played a kick ass role the movie was extremely brutal and blood lashed out everywhere from beginning to end but its a tarantino movie what do you expect i wasnt really bothered by that point despite it was a little unrealistic but i guess thats how it was suppose to be made overall tarantinos vol 1 is very stylish nevertheless and it also to add it had great music not as great as everyone says it was but it was still a good movie i recommend ithedeens outlook 7510  b,cruel
quentin has done it again and with no hesitation he pays tribute to the most interesting film genre of all time has got to be the most well put together homage to classic samurai movies of our time the great thing about this movie is that unlike the imported zatoichi movies this movie has no lame voice over actors and is far from wacky with the character mannerisms what makes this movie so enjoyable is that quentin although staying as true as he can to the pop culture was able to americanize it in his own way im a big fan of martial arts films and also of the wutang clan so then again for me this movie was heaven with rza on the tracks and the experience of sonny chibathe reason for the 70s martial arts film boom this film is great success not for everyone though adults cannot enjoy a movie where its impossible to count the limbs severed however the story can inspire any age,cruel
who are the greatest directors of all time the perfect movie i love tarantino audiovisual unsynchronized when winston wolf departs in his acura he takes a hard corner but the sound indicates continuous acceleration in a straight line while the acceleration is possible it would sound different going around a corner i think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film the godawful clones of tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not however detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie it works simply because those moments of brilliance i have to admit i know the whole jules redemptionspeech by heart that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effectlike all great films or even novels,cruel
volumes 1  2 quentin tarantino has now sucked all the milk from his earlier teat career wunderkind qt is no longer inventing hes caricaturizing everything he and other film makers did he has learned nothing positive or negative from warhol or devo 1  2 could easily be one film of standard length it wouldnt make it a better film but it would reduce the dragging dull scenes of repetitive slashing yes i said dull  there only so many limbs that can be removed in so many ways and endless pseudostoryladen philosophizing  my dinner with the squad i was obviously disappointed there were occasional witty moments some fun choreographing pretty animation and i often liked the atmosphere created by cover songs used in scenesbut even they were overused tarantino overuses everything including himself the centuries old and still valid challenge to all artists is to know when to stop on a workand it is before you run out of breath see reservoir dogs see pulp fiction and then stop wasting your time,cruel
i love this movietarentino is a genius this movie has many twists and turns and theres something about the way its shot that you cant tear your eyes from one thing i noticed was the color usage  quite a bit of hue for such a macabre film but for some reason this blended with it perfectlywhich brings me to my next point this movie pulled off some tricks that any other flick probably couldnt for instance when the bride was comatose in the hospital bed they split the screen to show elle driver disguising herself as a nurse that in its own right was risky because most flicks who try that tend to butcher the scene not the case with and despite the fact that elle driver was preparing to commit murder the music was oddly a cheerful and uplifting ditty fantasticthat actually happens a lot in this movie you hear music that you wouldnt normally find fitting for such a scene but for some reason when its thrown into the mix it turns out beautifully in addition i am a militant anime hater  and even i enjoyed the segment explaininglous life i found it morbidly artisticjust as a warning though this movie has a lot of gore if youre squeamish to bloody sword fights and decapitation you probably shouldnt watch this one of a big screen otherwise enjoy this flick i know i did,cruel

is a film of blood violence quentin tarrantino and thats about it the basic plot outline is extremely farfetched if not a little crazy but would be expect anything less from tarrantino we start out with a bit of murder and chaos take a trip back in time to learn why then we hurtle back to the present with more murder and chaos simple really the films main point of interest that makes it almost stand out from the crowd are the cleverly directed and choreographed samurai fight scenes between the bride uma thurman and what appears to be the rest of the world the main fight scene with the crazy 88 is very bloody graphic and realistic if not for a few wire stunts from thurman and some of the other scenes are rather disgusting to watch there is a now infamous head slamming in a metal hospital door scene disgusting as they are they are worked into the plot line very well by tarrantino and as with all his films it is extremely difficult to predict what will happen next i really did love the fact the films name was and bill did not die in this first outing a perfect set up for a sequel and now talks of a third clever money spinning tactics i think overall this film is pretty much a riot if you like your films gritty real and packed with more violence than a state prison is definitely worth a watch if your squeamish about the sight of blood guts or revenge doesnt appeal to you then go and rent something else and dont say i didnt warn you,cruel
tarantinos fourth and fifth film as director sees him blatantly working through his cinematic obsessions in a whirlwind of bloodletting and wirefu tarantinos movie mixes japanese yakuza samurai and hong kong martial arts genres together and even throws in a little anime segment by tokyos production ig studio and somehow it just about holds together there are some nice cameos too from tarantino hero sonny chiba and battle royale minx kuriyama chiaki miike takeshi favourite kunimura jun also has a small role too winding up on the wrong end of uma thurmans japanese steel the film is full of cool nerdy injokes for fans of this kind of stuff it even opens with the old made in shawscope logo that adorned hong kongs shaw brothers productions in the 70s somehow though despite the fact the movie is terrific fun for fans of eastern exploitation cinema and newbies alike it leaves you feeling slightly unsatisfied if youre a tarantino fan you might find yourself wondering where all the witty dialogue is that a good proportion of the movie is in japanese wont help either with only the occasional trademark witty oneliner thurmans to young gangster wannabe while smacking his ass with sword this is what you get for fking around with yakuzas now go home to your mommyalthough were assured theres lots of it in volume two which brings us on to the other real problem its no secret that was originally a three hour movie that miramax has sliced in half with their marketing katana unfortunately this is exactly how it feels too the movie just stops albeit on a plot revelation and up come the credits not quite the damp squib of matrix reloaded but perilously close and whereas that film had far too much plot and not enough action this seems to be the exact reverse even the dodgiest shaw bros vehicle revealed more motivation for its characters actions that does ultimately its a film that cannot be judged until weve seen the complete thing unlike the matrix or lord of the rings trilogies was never meant to be sliced up this way and despite its being divided into chapters anyway it doesnt seem to do the movie any favours personally i was always destined to enjoy this it panders to some of the things i like most about cinema and tarantino clearly grew up possibly the wrong words come to think about it on the same eastern grindhouse cinema i did myself my advice then rent out a couple of fukusuku kinji yakuza movies or miike takashis dead or alive films or shurayuki hime aka lady snowblood which this film borrows from most of all and have a marathon screening session with them and then see part one youll enjoy it so much more once you know which films its referencing and youll get to see some wonderful movies along the way,cruel

billed as tarantinos fourth film vol 1 is both a departure from what he has done before and a mix of all previous films it is primarily a kung fu revenge movie with many nods to past martial arts classics uma thurman plays the bride a pregnant woman shot and left for dead at her wedding by bill and his gang the people she used to work for after lying in a coma for four years she wakes and immediately begins her quest for revenge she is a killer and all of her abilities remain so she travels to japan to get herself the greatest sword ever made and pick off her old gang one by one by oneall the trademarks of the auteur are here the dialogue the nonlinear storytelling the clever camera angles and the violence but while his past films appealed to smartass critics this is one for the fans for himself for all the kids like me who grew up watching martial arts movies there is a great amount of bloodshed although it is all brilliantly and stylishly filmed and of course it is all done in a humorous way as usual tarantino gets the best out of his cast and they all seem to feel that it is an honour to work with him thurman is back to her best old favourites like sonny chiba and kenji ohba are excellent lucy liu is very good and all the smaller parts are filled admirably julie dreyfuss is also good and chiaki kuriyama of battle royale gonin and shikoku fame tarantino is clearly having fun making this experimenting with a variety of styles from manga and anime to filtering between black and white and colour the soundtrack is as effective as all his previous films the instrumental mixing well with the songs and noisesvol1 works mainly through all the impressive violence fun and games because of the bride and her quest we want to see her get revenge we want to see her destroy all the murdering mahfahs who get in her way and we want to see her for that though you may have to wait for part two unless youve wisely purchased that as well there are a few twists saving the biggest till last but overall this is a fun movie particularly for fans of fight films setting us up well for the more emotive vol 2 the chinese western part a good return for the best new american director of the nineties8 out of 10,cruel
this movie is simply one of the best movies in its genres ever the switching from color to black and white the characters the costumes the instant classic dialogues simply brilliant some of my friends think the movie is too difficult but it really isnt theyre just not used to gradea movies such as this one uma and her co actors put down a fantastic performance and the fight scenes are remarkable the enemies fierce and ruthless the opening scene makes you already feel sorry for our leading lady this is a vengeance movie unlike you have ever seen one enough babbling see this movie if you havent fast trust me you doare gonna love this flick,cruel
this movie has been criticized for having no substance no meat as it were now im no great fan of tarrantino in fact i hadnt liked a single of his productions before this one so there are no feelings to be hurt on his behalf there is no other reason for me to defend this film than the very real fact that i loved itthe second issue is the violence against women issue its been said that this movie is like a clockwork orange in its demonstration of everything that is wrong with our society okay as true as that may be this film covers many societies not just american it also shows that the woman does not have to be the victim she can and should stand on her own two feet and do something about her problems rather then waiting for some prince charming to come do it for herthis plot and story has been detailed so many times on imdb that i wont even bother laying out the plot except to say that this plot was so wellconceived and executed as to win it 10 awards and gross nearly 4 times its original budgetevery single artist involved in this attempt has surrendered a very compelling finished product in that it is a dark and lovely story yes it has a great story that is embedded with some of the most synergistically graphic brutality ive ever witnessed on film the action is unbelievable the narrative is instrumental in moving the story along from scene to scene and the score is as inspired as the screenplaythe choreography bysonny chiba who also portrayed hattori hanzo was excellent and when viewing the final work looked natural and brilliant and i must say that the soundtrack of this work was inspired and more than competently highlighted each scene in which the chosen music was featuredif you havent seen this i highly recommend it its action not horror or even drama its not for the squeamishit rates an 8810 fromthe fiend ,cruel
although it is somewhat different from the previous tarrantino movies it does have his specific signaturethe action scenes are quite violent and are portrayed with the sense of humor and irony that one expects of tarrantino blood sprays abundantly from chopped of limbs and heads and the fountainlike sound that makes only adds to the sense of unrealism that makes this type of movie easier to cope withthe story is told in the typical asynchronous style jumping back and forth in time and there is of course the camerashot from a trunk of a car but rather than shooting their way all around this time the hero and the villains go at each other with fists feet knives and swords the martial arts scenes are very impressive and despite the speed of these scenes there are still some very funny shots i particularly enjoyed the scene of a villain screaming while holding his chopped off foot in his handsinnovative and funny were the japaneseanimationstyle scenes about the youth and career of oren ishiiall in all i very much enjoyed this movie it was good but not as good as pulp fiction but perhaps thats just because im getting used to tarrantinomovies,cruel
the main thing i heard about this movie before i saw it was that it was the most violent movie ever made not surprising for a tarantino movie but once i saw it the violence turned out to be rather cartoonish which was i suppose the point evidently the movie was inspired by pays homage to or spoofs japanese anime cartoons i really dont care about the connection other than to say that i intensely dislike anime martial arts movies and the people who go ape over either its all very childish and quite emblematic of the ritalin generation nevertheless it is a tarantino film and it does have oodles of that sophisticated yet disgusting humor that make us tarantino watchers keep coming back for more tarantino could have cut out two hours of tiresome kung fu fight scenes and just made one movie but which would make everyone more money hmm well we know the answer currently this movie is at 58 in the top 250a distinction it doesnt deserve but it does deserve it more than some others on the list,cruel
vol 1 might be an amazing movie for someone whos never seen another movie like it unfortunately for me i have and quentin tarantinos latest is basically yet another tiresome rehash of worn out clichs from 70s grindhouse action flicks this has served him well in previous projects such as pulp fiction and jackie brown but vol 1 is wildly uneven missing at least as often as it hits the marki wont bother with the plot as just about everyone knows it by now if you havent seen it think high plains drifter times a hundred thats not necessarily a compliment  bigger is not necessarily better  and thats proved here repeatedly in the wake of such astonishing martial arts movies as the matrix and crouching tiger hidden dragon is old hatthere are some good scenes such as uma thurmans initial battle with former partner vivica a fox the derivativebutstillcool battle between thurman and dozens of japanese mafia warriors and especially thurmans showdown with a schoolgirl assassin wielding a razor embedded flail another fight between thurman and lucy liu is the movies highlightother than these points however theres just not much here it movies along at a good pace but has more than its share of beentheredonethat sequences that probably should have been left on the cutting room floorthe biggest problem with vol 1 and vol 2 for that matter is uma thurman herself her performance is jawdroppingly awful more often than not emulating a poststar trek william shatner with her contrived dramatic pauses bugging eyes and stilted delivery lucy liu plays the same character shes played in everything shes ever done so one cant really complain nor condemn her presence here the standout performance is darryl hannah as thurmans wouldbe assassin her role here is little more than a cameo but she is given much more to do in vol 2overall vol 1 is tarantinos weakest directorial effort its a bit better than natural born killers or true romance both of which it resembles stylistically but well beneath what tarantino fans have come to expect from the man himselfi must nitpick a bit here and say that the opening credits kind of ped me off with all the 4th film by quentin tarantino and 1 2 3 4 and 5 as the viper squad crap its selfindulgent film geek pseudo quirkiness at its worst at least he was kind enough to spare us the torture of watching him act,cruel
plot synopsis the bride uma thurman has just suffered the indignation of everyone at her wedding being brutally slaughtered now she wants revenge tarantino style this is tarantinos first film since 1997s jackie brown and this chopsocky asianinfluenced blooddrenched fanboys wetdream is the epitome of style over substance  entertaining actionpacked and fast paced yet lacking the depth of his previous films thus not holding up well in retrospectaction wise the film is brilliant tarantinos direction and wooping yuens fight choreography are set to induce many action reply moments on the dvd player with the thumping jpop soundtrack providing a great foil to the carnage however one of the most disappointing aspects of this film is the absence of tarantinos customary sparkling dialogue so evident in his previous outings a hackjob at its most blatant it is nonetheless a feast for the senses a true homage to pop culture,cruel
hello film fans and fanettesgeorge topouria herethe biggest reviewer from russia and i got the low down the juice the gist and the nub of the crux of the best of phew please dont make me repeat that phrase again ok lets go to the point is a very violent movie too violent in fact and thats its only problem for achieving high standards and naming itself the action film of the year 2004 i just feel that tarantino could use his talent to polish this movie a little more and maybe then we would witness a great actionpacked movie until then lets all believe the mistakes performed here will be disposed from the second part 810,cruel
this is an amazing film every time i see it it gets better the story the characters the soundtrack it is all a perfect mix to make one great film and the end result vol 1 and vol 2there were no let downs in this movie at all i love how it changes from format to format it just adds to greatness of this film there is also a great cliffhanger which will make sure you see the second filmbest parteither the fight between the crazy eighty eight or the fight between gogoworst partthere is none its all so good dyou will be a fool not to see this movie or the second one enjoyd,cruel
first off i generally enjoyed kb1 its got some very entertaining fight sequences and strong visual style and while the blood was excessive i found it more comical than gross even though i normally have a low threshold for gorebut im left with the same feeling i get from any tarantino film so what tarentino could be described as a pop artist like andy warhol who made his fame making replicas of campbell soup labels and putting them in art galleries tarantino made a very stylish slick high budget homagepastiche of shlocky action films it is convincingly like those movies but it doesnt bring anything new to the formula tarantinos films seem to exist entirely on the surface lacking any subtext beyond gee werent these movies really cool isnt lots of blood funny tarantinos consciousness seems to have gelled when he was about 17 and not gone anywhere since and his style serves only itself he has nothing to say about revenge or violence or the moral code of the warrior he just throws it all up on screen because he thinks its really neatowhich would be fine if he were making a cheap action picture but tarantino imbues his films with the sense that hes doing something really special when hes just recreating formative films from his childhood and the feeling that the movie means to be bigger and better than its inspirations but really isnt makes the experience somehow hollow and unsatisfying like a cake that is so airy you feel you havent eaten this so what feeling has kept me from enjoying previous tarantino films tarantinos scripts would work best with more straightforward direction which is why true romance worked better than any of the scripts he has directed himself still i did enjoy this movie overall i did give it 710 and it is the first tarantinodirected movie i have genuinely enjoyedi just feel its a shame that someone with obvious skill seems to have so little depth,cruel
ive been watching the beginning of your movie volume 1 and i failed to comprehend your motivation for the excessive violence i turned it off i studied film and watched your earlier 90s movies reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in these days in the mind frame i was in it seemed to make sense at least someone making such movies because of the discussion it provoked on the explicitness of violence in film as a subject i wrote a paper on it but already had moral problems of course i am free to watch or not but you are free to make such movies or not too so why do you i regarded your movies as thought provoking and sort of a reaction to be in a way in opposition to violence in the casual way it gets portrayed in cinema or television series in abundance in many ways which one could almost condone it thats why i thought you to be in fact a very moral person who could oversee the moral complexity of his actions while taking things to and over the edge by now i feel you have tripped into a minefield with no way out and dragging me as a spectator in there a little with you isnt there a comparison to the way in which the military fighting for a good cause may become as dark as the supposed evil that they are fighting is it a misconception of my part to place you in this discussion in this way or is it just the thrill of making such violent movies do you actually still have the overview or has the car run of with the driver could you make any more brutal a movie do you want people to see violence for what it is or has it just become a trade i know youre not walt disney by the way and of course donald duck is also quite violent or are youa naive dreamer for a more friendly world,cruel
is one of the truly hottest movies made in recent memory there certainly was some hype associated with its debut we knew for example it was to be made in two parts but had no clue why that might be a good idea well that as well as the structure and tone of the film were all good ideaswhat we immediately conclude is that finest of accolades there is no movie like this or put another way find me a film in which there are great chick fights an opening number as it turns out mean blonde bad girls with eye patches half a dozen edgy moments in which we might want to look away but instead grit our teeth and watch  voyeuristic as it may seem or listen to a score masterfully matched to the actionthis is the revenge film of revenge films the bride uma thurman has been seriously wronged by bill  david carridine  in the best work we have ever seen him do and is out to make it right well have revenge anyway the rightness of her actions questionable but probably what we would like to do ourselves given her situationwe also have recorded here some of the strongest female characters ever shown on film in fact nearly all the women are stronger than any man portrayed and this is fascinating without doubt men troubled by tough women wont like much of what they see here but those men that dont will be treated to some nifty nicetieswitness as uma thurman runs through her list of former associates that shes determined must be eliminated the first great femme  femme fight ever recorded then watch assassin lucy liu as oren ishii deliver a stunning boardroom speech there are no moments less riveting as the bride moves though her listfor sheer style there have not been very many films offered us that convey such tongueincheek mayhem put this one on your list of mustsees rating four stars,cruel
if you want to see a feel good movie or if youre faint of heart this is not the movie for you if you like blood and revenge then vol1 is the movie for you i would highly recommend seeing this movie it is an action thriller was directed by quinton tarantinoit starts out with a young bride who is in the deadly viper assassination squad she wants to leave the team for a normal life the leader bill david carradine has the bride uma thurman watch them kill her wedding party then he shoots her in the head putting her in a coma for four years when she awakes she has vowed revenge this two part series is very gory she hunts down the team starting at the bottom and working her way up to bill first she hunts down vernita green aka copperhead vivica a fox and fights her in her own home then she goes to okinawa to find hattori hanzo a master sword maker for a sword to go after oren ishii lucy liu they have a magnificent battle on a snow covered japanese garden this movie has more action than you can imagine the plot is very intriguing and dramatic i like the way it always has something happening and it is fast paced this is a movie that you can watch many times the first movie defiantly makes us want to see the second one the movie has blood and body parts flying everywhere one critic even says its the goriest movie ever released in the us quinton tarantino has outdone himself on this series like his other classics pulp fiction reservoir dogs and jackie brown tarantino proves he can still make an original idea into a movie,cruel
this really dragged for the first 90 minutes the first 70 of the film is largely rubbish fortunately the last 30 is superb particularly the ensemble slaughter and the lady snowblood tribute at the end vol 2 works much better as a film and this would really have been better as a single 3 hour or even 330 film with the rubbish cut out the fight choreography is great and holds up well against hong kongjapanese movies  not surprising given who was involved for anyone who hasnt seen vol2 yet its worth sitting through vol 1,cruel
on the hospital scene just as the sick male nurse presents the comatosed bride to the trucker dude the script mentioned a closeup of a very beautiful lovely bunch of blonde pubic hair i think the scene is really missing for it would set the tone a few notches up for the violence that comes afterwards and perhaps would have made it even more justifiable what i mean is the audience reacts well to edges of emotion and sex is the edgiest of edges anyone who has seen irreversible will understand my point its greatly more disturbing to see the contrast between sex and violence if there is more graphic display of the sex,cruel
and i really dig it its a tale of revenge this time with a hot sword toting uma thurman who woke up from a 4 year coma she was beat up and shot by her former partners the deadly viper assassination squad on her wedding day and very pregnant as with other tarantino films this one goes back and forth in time and this time it really works and is not confusing plus great music is used as usual and i have to say i really laughed when in the beginning the little girl comes home to find her mom and the bride covered in blood and broken glass and the mom says the dog did it also the pussywagon truck and when the bride wakes up and takes care of buckall the sword fighting was very well done uma did a great job with the training it must have took to do all that i do wish the fight with lucy liu would have been longer and a more dramatic death but the way she dies was funny and it certainly was not too violent because all the blood and limbs flying were so overthetop and unrealistic which is how it was supposed to be i loved the fight with gogo because of her weapon of choicefinal verdict i cant wait to see volume 2 i highly recommend it very entertaining and amusing its a homage to old kungfu films with great visuals and cinematography,cruel
i wasnt really sure i wanted to see this movie at first afraid it might not be as good as any of the other tarantino films ive seen one day however quite recently i was watching one of my premium cable channels and there it was just asking me to watch itso to speak i sat down gave it nearly my full attention and became intrigued within minutes yet again the beautiful and talented uma thurman dazzled the screen of a tarantino film this time not nearly as helpless as she appeared to be in pulp fiction armed at first with only a knife she embarks on a journey with the sole intent to seek revenge on those who destroyed what was to be her life as usual this film didnt go in chronological order causing the viewer to really pay attention to the fine details of the movie thus creating a well captivating thrillerdramacomedy yes i said comedy i know it may not seem that way to some but there some just plain funny parts to this movie in a way i suppose is impossible to explain even the end of this movie while you knew it was going to be a cliffhanger kept you guessing up until the last minute and definitely made me run out and rent vol 2 which perhaps not as good in the fight scene aspect yet still achieved a thumbs up in my opinion good job again quentin my man keep em comin,cruel
some of tarantinos work will stay with me forever   my last thought before i hit off the first tee is we should have shotguns for this   stuck in the middle played as background for the garter ceremony at my daughters wedding   every ml or aa shake is now a 5 shake even work that isnt his visually is trademarked in his writing check out dennis hoppers history of the italian people in true romance some work however may not meant to last that long kb1 and 2 are delightfully enjoyable while the film runs but disappear almost as quickly as the screen goes dark following the credits i waited to watch both in a backtoback but ended up with a 24 hour interruption perfect id suggest this mo to anyone who hasnt seen the movies and hasnt been talked out of seeing them keep the remote handy when the scene shifts to the house of blue leaves kb1   the tracking shot into the ladies room is worth a rewind,cruel
begins as a black and white preview of a beaten beatrix kiddo uma thurman who is talking to someone as the camera stays focused on her face a bullet pierces her skull and the credits immediately start to roll this movie has me eagerly waiting the whats going on question that sits in the back of my head while my eyes are glued to the tv as the movie progresses kiddo starts her angerdriven rampage with vernita green vivica a fox the list includes from least important to most oren ishii lucy liu budd michael madson elle driver daryl hannah and finally bill david carradine kiddo goes about the entire film eliminating the characters one by one when doing this she takes her time to plan out each kill precisely down to the way shes going to fight kiddo only gets to oren ishii before the movie ends and continues the rest of the story in volume2whats great about this movie is that it doesnt come out and bluntly tell us this is why this is happening the film took us through loopholes from the present and then back to the past to explain why each person was on her list during kiddos less important kills it foreshadows a twist in the plot later in the second movie that drove me to go out and rent volume2 i think the reason this movie is so intriguing is that ive never seen a film relate one story from the past to the future story so well without making me want to press the stop button the amount of detail used in this film and the more than unusual storyline had me hooked from the beginning and kept me going through the entire film even enough to spend more money to finish it i was quite surprised that director quentin tarantino didnt bore me to death like his other films where the story went nowhere i was very impressed by the plot setting and the technique used to create this wonderful story this film was interesting and truly one of a kind,cruel
ive lived existed and worked in japan for the last ten years and i am absolutely bowled over by the knowledge mr tarantino shows in this film he knows 70s japanese tv serials earlier 50s 60s yakuza films and so much more even an astute insight to contemporary japanese manga comics is as a good as a long termer could expect this film could be a turn of for those who dont want to or who simply do not know anything about japan but this film is incredible as a mimic of another cultures film genre the guy is either lucky i dont believe in luck or a fkin genius i hate and love him for it in the same breath how dare he be so talenteduma thurmans japanese sucks he should of chosen me,cruel
vol 1 what to say simply awesome uma thurman shows a lot of talent in film that could have just faltered in its seams with the powerful performance of its star uma quentin tarantino know for his crude language and resurrection of actors careers is show how good of a writer and director he really can be showing his love of old japanese martial art films and the change from black and white and color as well the use of modern day set designs colorful contemporary costumes i loved the ensemble cast as well as the flat in your face bloody bodys put in with humor this 12 of a film sure makes you want to put both of them together to make sure the whole film makes plenty of sense,cruel
quentin tarantino is a genius if you are a fan of his or not you must agree that his talent is exquisite vol 1 is an extremely bloody masterpiece about a female assassin who was attacked on her wedding day put into a coma for 4 years awakes from the coma and swears revenge on bill her former leader and lover yes this film is very bloody but its a tarantino film do you expect these characters to kiss and make up tarantino has never made a bad film all of his movies reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown vol 1 and 2 are all in my top 10 films of alltime you cant get any better than this film you just cant1010,cruel
the first half of quentin tarantinos revenge epic is a spectacular exercise in bloody stamina with uma thurman giving a great performance as the bride who seeks revenge against the man who wrong her she goes to great lengths to get her man and in this first half of this epic she goes though everyone and everything to get him expect to be shocked and wowed by what will happen on screen when she pursues her quarry and expect to be dazzled hands down this is tarantinos best film since pulp fiction and he proves once again to be the pinnacle of modern cinema this is the first half of tarantinos bloody soap opera and the second half in my opinion is better than the first,cruel
the movies offered up such a tremendous amount of entertainment its almost beyond quantifying  i originally didnt want to see these movies because the thought of the blood letting and violence put me off for some reason i picked up volume i on a friday night on a whim  i loved it  the bloodletting and violence bordered on being a live cartoon well there it was part cartoon which lessened the effect of the violence and heightened the flat out effect of entertainment  i enjoyed part i so much that i got part ii out of the video store the next evening  part ii was different more characterization and less flatout blood letting  both were extremely enjoyable  this is not the type of violence depicted in reservoir dogs which i found to be so real that it was disturbing  if you have the taste for cartoon violence and eloquently directed fight scenes youve got to see this pair of films,cruel
vol 1 marks the return of acclaimed directorwriter quentin tarantino to the cinema screen after a sixyear hiatus tarantino originally made as a 180minute homage to films that have influenced him he seems to enjoy 70s kung fu movies the most however the movie studios economic concerns over a threehour film meant the director was asked to split the film into two parts hence we have this film vol 1 with vol 2 being released some time after vol 1 tells the story of the bride uma thurman and her quest to david carradine  who we hear but do not see in this film her grudge with bill is the result of bill and his serpent named assassination squad of which she was a member interrupting her wedding by killing everyone the bride manages to survive a bullet to the head that leaves her in a coma her unborn child it seems was not so lucky after she awakens she swears she will have her revenge on bill and the rest of his assassins as this is the first of the two films the bride only encounters two of bills assassins vernita green vivica a fox and oren ishii lucy liuthe story unfolds in chapters that are not necessarily in chronological order much like pulp fiction tarantinos script is always entertaining as it takes the bride along her journey along the way she encounters several colourful characters such as buck who likes to and hattori hanzo sonny chiba it is interesting that some of the best moments in this movie are the scenes with hanzo a legendary japanese sword maker that are quite sombre while the rest of the film is mostly fast paced action the plot also features some nicely thrown in unusual moments such as the brides real name being beeped out whenever another character says it an element of accuracy is also present since the bride battles atrophy after she awakens from her coma the main disappointment though is a lack of proper character development and none of the excellent dialogue that tarantino does so wellin terms of direction tarantino shows that he has learnt a few new tricks these include one scene that is entirely in japanese anime and several others filmed in black and white however one must question whether the choice to do this was an artistic one or an attempt to tone down the violencethe cinematography in this movie is stunning there is no better example of this than a scene filmed in undisturbed snow that becomes covered in blood the contrast created by the red blood on the white snow is something to behold also visually captivating are the wellchoreographed action sequences where uma thurman shines in fact her fight scene with the crazy 88 gang is much better than the hyped neo vs several agent smiths in the matrix reloaded the action seems to fall flat however whenever a limb is severed the blood spews so ridiculously that it looks more like a gag in a monty python film than an action movie tarantino has apparently done this effect purposely as part of his homage to 70s kung fu films but it seems stupid and out of placein terms of acting vol 1 has little arguably sonny chiba as hattori hanzo gives the best performance uma thurman is good as the bride especially her fighting sequences that clearly required extensive physical training however she never truly gets enough time to display her acting talents lucy lius performance is not very good but is still her best one to date the less that can be said about vivica a foxs acting ability the better so it is pleasing to see that she gets little screen time and dialogue the remainder of the cast is unobtrusive and does not hamper the film overall vol 1 is a fine film that highlights a director who is a master of his craft it has a good plot scored with some highquality music and is visually beautiful the only disappointments are a lack of quality dialogue and some sub par acting one cannot help to wonder what might have been if this motion picture had not been cut in half,cruel
as a movie fan i wouldnt like to say i dislike asian cinema i simply havent seen enough to comfortably pass judgment i am certainly not a fan and imagine it to be a genre that would be quite difficult for me to get into the excuse that ive seen thrown around that volume one is almost solely for asian film fanatics is ludicrous i dont believe that this film will necessarily make an asian film fan out of anyone and i should know because i bloody loved it but maybe thats because i was a tarantino fan beforeso the plot at this point isnt particularly deep and the characters arent very well explored but all this can be forgiven due to the equally excellent volume two which fleshes everything out nicely the cast do a good job this time around but it isnt until volume two that the extent of their work can truly be appreciated it isnt even until then that tarantinos smart dialogue really comes into play volume one is solely about style and i hope the wachowskis are watching because there really is much they could learn hereit is so refreshing to watch an action sequence that for once feels so real the overabundance of cgi elements in the matrix films amongst others rose the action to absurdity it was also nice to see the sequences in play out solely in real time none of that slowmotion crap which is a real thrill killer of course all this would mean nothing without the great control tarantino shows during these scenes a fine balance was retained which makes you root for the bride but at the same time not take things too seriously tarantino wants his audience to have a good time theres not nearly enough directors who hold that value to the same extent i find it laughably ironic that this movie is seen as homage to many previous works but delivers some of the freshest action sequences in recent years i must also say it pays to see the house of blue leaves sequence in smashing fullcolour goodness if you can get hold of the japanese versionthe anime sequence really opened my eyes and showed theres more to japanimation than pokmon when i first heard about it i questioned its value but its executed brilliantly and is phased in seamlessly of course there is no reason for it other than to contribute to the films style and as i said thats what volume one is all aboutthe soundtrack is tarantinos most diverse yet this isnt an ordinary film so an ordinary soundtrack wont do the pieces that tarantino has gathered do an admirable job with a few original pieces a first for tarantino from the rza to fill the gapsi wont deny that without the presence of volume two its easy to dismiss this first installment as shallow but it delivers a level of sheer entertainment with eye bleeding visuals that shame most blockbusters 910,cruel
was originally supposed to be one movie but since the movie would have ended up being so lengthy it was decided that two movies should be made  because of this vol 1 got much less of the story and more of the action  vol 1 doesnt play like a regular movie since theres so little story and you feel theres something missing in the movie even though you know its all going to emerge in vol 2  the movie is mostly made up of a few gruesome battles and a couple of scenes which really make the movie fun to watch and one dorky anim sequence which doesnt  vol 1 is pretty good not tarantinos best film but better than jackie brown  the best way to enjoy the film is probably to watch it and vol 2 backtoback so that youre not left hanging at all and so that you dont forget all the stuff from vol 1 that is mentioned in vol 2  nine stars out of ten,cruel
volume 1 is an entertaining look at what tarantino gleaned from his years of indulging in highoctane lowbrow entertainment as we all know by now this movie has elements of anime chopsocky chambara kungfu and the spaghetti western i had hoped that tarantino the most revered of all popculture nuts would be able to combine these elements with the dialogue of pulp fiction or reservoir dogssuch a combo would have been brilliant but the dialogue is not there and the cool characters of tarantinos usual writing are strangely absent in lieu of the likes of the legendary mr blonde and vincent vega we have the bride beatrix kiddo vernita green and oren ishii these characters have meat but leave much to be desired the second installment satisfies more in this departmentwhats more much of the material has been pilfered big surprise here from other films paying homage is not a crime is a fun and violent tribute to these movies that deserves to be enjoyed but not worshiped,cruel
is an onslaught of violence that is not artistic  it has many trappings of artistic violence  but it crosses too often into revelling in its graphicnessa violent film needs to have violence of one of three types1 artistic  like crouching tiger hidden dragon  then fight sequences in that film were like watching a well choreographed dance2 unique  the matrix  such as the opener in the original the battle with the merovingians guards in the 3rd3 heartpounding purposeful  like gladiator  maximus seems to be fighting for his life in there and it seems that he could lose at any point  he beats insurmountable oddsvol 1 does not deliver on any of those three levels  with the exception of the fight scene involving vivica a fox meets the conditions of 2  tarantino has gotten violence right in the past  in pulp fiction when bruce willis character kills zed and his buddy that fit into 3you never get a chance to root for the bride she cant seem to lose  her quest is well positioned in that we understand her want for revenge  but she doesnt seem to be in any danger so it is hard to root for heri give it a b,cruel
when i first saw this movie i was taken aback from all the action a thing that made it interestingthe plot was quite good a mother taking revenge for the death of her child and driving all the way to kill the persons who are responsible for her death i said wtf when i saw uma therman fighting with a woman in the first chapter and the little girl walking in the house seeing those 2 women in blood and those 2 saying that the dog had made all this mess the most stupid thing i have ever heard and it is unexcusable cos since the movie contains small dialogues they should have given detail to them of course 1 was a lot better than the second but it deserved the 710 for all the exaggeration it was made to itall in all i hope that quentin tarantino tries to make more serious films in the future and ditch all these i dont even know how to call them everyone should watch pulp fiction and compare it to ,cruel
as i watched the start of this film i was pained because i thought i was going to be doomed to sit through two and a half hours of painful exploitation rip offs done in a gee whiz look at me style then some where about 45 minutes in this movie started to spark to life and it became a thrill ride to the blood soaked endingfar from a great film this film is certainly a very guilty pleasure quentin tarantino knows his schlock fodder enough to copy it down to its awful technical nature this film gets so many of the grade z movie styles right i became certain that tarantino never went to school in his life we must have been separated at birthif you like action if you like exploitation if you like movies see this movie its kick ass and lots of fun8 out of 10,cruel
i gave this film a 10 star vote because it pushes every limit in the cinematic modern arts  tarantino has a talent for taking brilliant shots at what a movie could be and turning out a miracle movie such as this oneuma thurman is great rza made great music for this movie the action sequences are beautifully done with excellent cinematography especially the silhouetted swordfighting against a bluebacklit wall the animation was amazingly lifelike thanks to animation producers like kazuto nakazawa and altogether the story was just fantastically layered and complex  a great movie and certainly a classic,cruel
all the attendant of a wedding including the pregnant bride uma thurman have been killed by an assassination squad the sheriff and his son think that this has been done by professionals although she was shot in the head the bride is not dead but is in a coma four years later the bride wakes up she realizes that she has lost her child but also the husband she was going to marry since she knows the name of all the murderers they were former assassination squad fellows she decides to seek revenge by killing them one after the other the first is vernita green aka copperhead who lives in a suburban house the second is the terrible oren ishii boss of the japanese mafia who is protected by the 17year old gogo yubari and the crazy 88 bodyguardsin fact vol 1 is not a movie but half of a movie as its title obviously indicates you cant be satisfied watching this one only especially since vol 2 is much better and contains the entire plot in this first part uma thurman is taking her revenge on those who killed her baby her husband and almost killed herself this movie is a tribute to samourai movies it is very violent but very well directed it is probably vol 1 that is to this date the best technical achievement of quentin tarantino as a director the manga sequence is great even if it is hardly watchable for those who dont like to see blood on screen the whole fight sequence in japan is a masterpiece of action movie and a lesson of cinema among the two main components of tarantino movies that is 1 violent fight scenes and 2 funny talkative scenes this volume 1 contains 80 of component 1 and 20 of component 2 its the opposite in volume2 this first part is just an appetizer to the second dont miss volume 2 i give this one 810,cruel
with the twovolume series of films that come to be known as quentin tarantino has achieved a level of creativity lacking in most modern films that will take years to surpass  is in fact an amalgam of all the grindhouse cinema outings that tarantino made during the 70swhen you think real hard about it the plot to is absolutely ludicrous and under the direction of a normal filmmaker wouldnt make it past the 50minute mark  but under tarantinos careful guidance that ludicrous plot remains ludicrous but he injects his requited love of cinema into the material and the plot suddenly takes a life and a whole new spinis by far tarantinos most accomplished work as a director considering that i typically favor his nondirectorial efforts true romance natural born killers from dusk till dawn over his own directorial outings reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie browni certainly look forward to more from quentin tarantino in the future being that with he has created a cinematic epic of one mans love of movies and then seeing it realized on the screen,cruel
has been promoted as if it was the answer to the matrix but it turns out to be a very bad b movie  tarantino tries to copy the matrix but hasnt got it in his fingers to bring to that level for examplethe ridiculous way the blood squirts out of people makes it look like a cheap horror movie its totally unnecessary to make part 2  its a waste of money  time and talent maybe pulp fiction was just a lucky shot  and made it that good because travolta and jackson where in it i hope there will not be a 3 cause then quentin might get the idea that he is on the right track with this kind of movies,cruel
this was probably one of the best movies i have seen in a long time at the cinema  from the moment the movie started i was sucked into tarantinos world  the filming styles which he uses to film the movie is wonderful the action scenes are executed so well and have you on the edge of your seat  its hard to describe this film without revealing any details my partner cant stand these fighting type movies but she absolutely loved this  she was left like myself excited about the wait for volume 2 in my own opinion i would say that this film is tarantinos finest  with volume 2 next to ita truly remarkable movie that will be played over and over again,cruel
i had wanted to see vol 1 since i saw previews for it whenever they started advertising it  my parents are huge tarantino fans and they wanted to see it as well  sadly though we didnt get out to theaters to see it during its original releasemy best friend actually saw it before me something that rarely happens and she said that she just thought it was okay  i was a bit disappointed by it but even though shes my best friend i dont usually go by her movie advice  she doesnt appreciate fine cinema as much as i do  or quite like i do  to say i was underwhelmed to see the movie from her review i wouldnt be lying  luckily enough once it came out to buy my dad bought the dvd no questions asked  although it probably took me another 2 weeks to finally have enough time to watch itbut all the waiting anticipating and hype was completely worth it  this movie is just in a word awesome  uma thurman gives an awesome performance as the bride in the first installment  as a hit woman out to avenge the deadly attack on her on her wedding day she did such a wonderful job  i even enjoyed lucy liu in this flick as divas nasty oren ishii  usually i have a hard time watching her but i actually really liked her  i also liked vivica a foxs spunky portrayal as vernita green  and how heartbreaking was that scene in the kitchen when nikki comes in to find that horrible discoverydirector quentin tarantino crafts a smart sophisticated bloody masterpiece that almost anyone will enjoy  he pays great homage to the saturday morning kungfu shows that many people used to watch in the early 1970s  even his tribute to anime during the chapter the original of oren didnt bug me which is a huge feat to accomplish  to tell the truth i really liked it it was done cleverly and had a good story behind it so it didnt really bug me  i especially  love the scene where the bride kicks the coffee cup across the kitchen at vernita i think just because it looks cool on screeni was psyched to finally be able to see vol 1 and was totally impressed  it was completely worth the wait and i was happy to see that i wasnt disappointed by all the hype that was surrounded around it  it really did live up to iti cannot wait for vol 2 to come out so i can finally see the closing chapter to this amazing work of art,cruel
modernized samurai movies are always the bomb volume 1 definitely puts the s in slasher there was a lot of violence a lot of blood and lots of maiming going round in this movieuma thurman the tall beautiful blondbombshell really made her role extremely dangerous for some stars first left at the alter dead and pregnant when she comes to her baby is gone unknowst to her that her child is still alive and well too bad that they didnt show her child after she was comatose all these years at least she wasnt left a complete amnesiac otherwise she would gone through the stage of moving her toeafter her time of being in a coma the first thing on her mind was revenge on all those who doublecrossed her leaving one daughter orphaned slicing and dicing a slew of enemies in her path taking out the lethal ball and chain girl i mean man shes not going to rest unless shes good luck bride you need it hahahahaha this movie was so action packed its a big big keeper in the video library enough to lose your head over for a big 10 5 stars,cruel
after my first viewing of i was left with a feeling of what the hell was that after the second viewing of the film i loved it the music works with the film perfectly and really complements the pacing of the film the dialogue can be a little hokey but plays out perfectly in a showdown leonelike style overall the movie is very entertaining though there is extreme extreme violence i am not particularly squeamish when it comes to movie violence as i have seen many movies much more brutal that however the violence in the film manages to maintain a slapstick like quality and never takes itself too seriously great movie im really looking forward to seeing vol 2,cruel
i held back my review of 1 and 2 until i saw both movies esp since originally it was one movie which is confirmed by the credits in kb2 i do like quentins work albeit in kb1 i found myself asking why what is so intriguing entertaining pleasing shocking confusing about it well exactly that it is all of that but kb1 fails to deliver in that respect it is technically brilliant and all students of film making will get the most out of it but a movie is plot driven which in turn is carried by its characters and i really fail to see why this simply plot has to be stretched out over 2 movies it is lengthy oversaturated chock full with abhorrent dialogue and uma thurman doesnt convince me in the least she can wield a samurai sword without cutting herself upit seems quentin has a big bonus due to his prior work and rightly so and when it comes to reviews of kb1 i cannot help but feel that he used it all up with kb12so when i left the theatre after seen kb1 i asked my fellow viewers what they thought everyone agreed that this movie is pointless literally it has no point we care not why when if killers kill themselves under whatever circumstances and we certainly care not just because it has coolness written all over it it lacks the certain intelligent and witty touch his prior flicks possessedothers i asked were enraged when i voiced my critique and pointed out that this is a masterpiece a homage to all the trash movies and animes and to that art of film making per se i grant you that but why does this make it a good movie because well thats just not good enough for me and what about the soundtrack you got me there yes it is top notch in kb1 and 2610,cruel
i just finished this movie and i immediately ran to comment on it it is a masterpiece quentin tarantino really pulled it off again i assumed that this movie would be just a wannabe kungfu movie but americanized i was wrong this movie in fact surpasses many kungfu movies i have seenwhen the opening credits came through i saw that the rza had done the music for the movie from that moment i knew it would add an interesting twist on the movie it was very interesting indeed the music to the movie really helps provide emotion and dept to the movie also on many occasions it had me tapping my feet or jamming to music very good idea seeing how rza of wutang is known to be a big fan of kungfu so it must have brought some good motivation on his partthe fight scenes of course were unrealistic beyond belief and in a lot of movies that is a bad thing except this one the unrealistic and gory fight scenes definitely made the movie there was blood all over the place i dont think ive ever seen so much blood in a movie its incredible the fight scenes in this movie were off the charts reminded me of crouching tiger hidden dragon well minus the flying all over the placewhen i heard that the movie was going to be starred by uma thurman i was definitely spectacle of her ability to portray to role but again i was wrong as the movie developed and when the movie ended i couldnt think of anyone else to fill the slot oh man i could pick apart every part of this movie and comment on it and they would all be positive so my final words are it is a great movie watch it if you havent im ready for volume two,cruel
when quentin tarantino was filming the movie pulp fiction he and one of the stars uma thurman were joking around about a bride who went around the world killing people in a fit of revenge in 2003 the movie was released portraying that same joke as a old style samurai movie that brought the world the 4th movie by tarantinothe story starts in el paso tx the bride thurman has been beaten to the floor by the deadly viper assassination squad that consists of oren ishii lucy liu elle driver daryl hannah vernita green vivica fox budd michael madsen and their leader bill david carradine this squad beats the bride so badly that she ends up in a coma for four years but once awoken she begins a road of revenge one by one she plans to kill her attackers and take revenge for the death of her friends fiance and unborn baby little did she know that the baby lived and lived with her father the aforementioned bill due to miramax deciding the movie was going to be too long in whole was split into two volumes the first concentrated on the brides first two killingsoren ishii and vernita green so if you wish to see a good looking blonde killing her way through a band of japanese yakuza warriors with just the help of her samurai sword then volume 1 is for you,cruel
im 28 female your typical middleclass office worker married one child a day doesnt go by that i dont think about this movie for at least 5 minutes my second favorite action movie fightclub and like fightclub this movie created an urge in me to let loose id really love to start up again with some martial arts something i gave up at the age of 11 after only 8 weeks of training i also believe appeals to other generations my 12 year old niece loved it we have watched it together 4 times we both couldnt wait to see volume 2 not to sound negative but anyone who doesnt appreciate this movie should probably stick to their soaps and reruns of friendsat this moment this is me at my most masochistic,cruel
i did though i loved it i am anxious to see the sequeli did not like the scene where the little girls sees her mother die but it set the stage for the rest of it and somehow brought it all together i have to admit that i thought it would be cheesy and silly but it surprised the heck out of me a few of the scenes got a little long and drawn out but funny thing is when it was over i wanted to still be watching it go figure brilliant movie making two thumbs up great entertainment and just watching this girl kick hineys all over the place was good for my frustrations,cruel
the brilliant jackie brown im convinced was an accident of acting talent over direction which dangles a theme albeit a hackneyed take on existential vs final justice should be taglined hey its me quentin look what im doing now is this clever or whatuma thurman is absolutely spellbinding and her performance is almost contrition for the unremitting agony of tarantinos inyourface illiterate filmmakinglucy liu play lucy liu does she have an agent pulp fiction we get it thanks,cruel
sing along to the 70s classic kung fu fightingchorus in volume one everybody was kung fu fighting that chic uma was quick as lighting and the film sometimes was violently frightening and there was even a daryl hannah sightingthere was uma thurman as the bride killing with her knives there was vivica fox as brides first knock there was lucy lucy liu looking badass as you knew but one thing still stays impact uma is on a vengeance attackchorus tarantino does expert writing his storytelling is exciting he shows to much fighting even though is still quite excitinguma thurman is the star and is her best role by far some feel she should have won an oscar for her lead in this nar you might have felt it too but there is always volume twoend of songvolume one has enough chills thrills and spills to recommend for you not to kill volume one from your movies to watch list sayonara  good,cruel
id put off watching for three reasons 1 as i had heard mixed reviews 2 i love pulp fiction and reservoir dogs too much to lose respect for qt and 3 mainly because i didnt think it would be my kind of film yet as i watched it i found myself impressed amused stimulated and generally enjoying it i thought the script was clever and witty the acting was superb the music was fantastic and the colours were vibrant i wouldnt say its a favourite of mine but i am left intrigued and curious and most importantly wanting to see the followup surely this is the desired effect in conclusion i must hold up my hands and admit that my initial preconception of the film was simply wrong yet the fact that i didnt expect much may have been why i enjoyed it,cruel
im not a fan of revenge films most martial arts films have revenge as their central plot and are ultimately predictableis different die hard fans of classic kungfu and samurai films might be offended by this movie because its almost mocking the genre that said tarantino pays homage to a wide range of movies whilst applying his enigmatic stylethe fight choreography is excellent and convincing  and theres lots of it its probably a good idea to forget every martial arts film youve ever seen and watch this film and acknowledge its individual merits uma thurman does a great job of telling the story and youre always on her sidei havent seen vol 2 yet but after watching vol 1 its essential that i do watch vol 2 not only to complete the experience but to see where the twist takes itan impressive masterpiece that deserves respect tarantino does it again,cruel
quentin tarantino may have been off the hollywood radar for six years but the former reservoir dog has shown hes lost none of his bite with a film that is truly a masterpiece of cinema proving that you cant define a film by one genre tarantino has put together a samurai sword fighting spaghetti western part kung fu revenge thriller which is the work of a director at the top of his game the story goes like this uma thurman is the bride a former member of an elite assassination squad she is viciously gunned down along with the rest of the wedding party by her former employers awakening after a coma of 4 years the bride extracts her revenge going after each member with bill the boss at the top of her list thurman as the bride is astonishing her performance maintaining a hardened femininity in the mist of all the violence her costume deliberately reminiscent of bruce lee in game of death is iconic her samurai sword as sharp as her beauty tarantinos use of anime to tell the background story of a character is effective while the black humour that punctuates any grim scene is classic tarantino proving he can bring out two emotions from an audience that was only reaching for one other performances live up to the last with daryl hannah perfect as the seriously short tempered elle driver codename california mountain snake while vivica a fox is a high kicking mean machine whose fight with the bride is interrupted when her daughter comes home from school lucy liu here is no charlies angel more bills devil now a gangland leader who is in the brides sights for her part in the wedding day massacre this is a film that has incredible style with substance to match made by a director who is a film fans filmmaker and not just a cog in the hollywood machine some critics have attacked the film for its violence but this is being blind to its story yes it is gory but it is shown in a cartoon manner and while most films have stories set in the real world is set in the movie world where real time is exchanged for reel time with a cool seventies soundtrack and the promise of a volume two to come is a movie fans dream,cruel
this style in this film could have been good but overall it is a bloody mess without the help of vol 2 too much blood and gore throughout the action scenes the script isnt even nearly as good as true romances the story is basically about a bride who is assaulted on her wedding day and wakes up three years later and seeks revenge on everybody tarantino is not an action or martial arts director he usually does well in crimethriller films reservoir dogs uma thurman is good but the rest just stand out a bit it would have been better if actors like harvey keitel steve buscemi or tim roth has at least a cameo tarantino has done better and i hope he will do better in the future 255 stars,cruel
when i came home after seeing kb i said to myself as if id only just realized that its storytelling had been kind of incredible and it is its great slowness the title cards the way they fade in slow fade out slow the way it has chapters like a great piece of literature the epic fight scenes the epic explanations of prior events that really is hatori hanzo steel it does everything bigbut as soon as i sat down in my home i couldnt look at my pulp fiction screenplay which id been the night before to get autographed by qt as he signs so he can sign as many as possible and felt kind of sick in the stomach i wasnt going to admit it yet but i was like a son who idolises his father only to realize one day that his father wasnt such top st after alli was quite attached to qt id loved pulp for many years but it took a second viewing of volume 1 for me to face the facts was just plain uninteresting it was probably the worst film to stand a second viewing since batman and robin i was having flashbacks to batman and robin actually during the film i guess its a sign of how bored i was reaped absolutely nothing from a second viewing first viewing youve seen absolutely all there is to see because he hands it to you so slowly so much is wrung out of the most insignificant little moments the ten minute sushi scene the twenty minute swordmaking scene the halfhour anime scene the ten minute hospital scene that its overwrought almost to breaking pointwhat tarantino has done in is like putting a bowtie on a turd its like putting frills and pretty lace on a pair of work shorts its like putting a gold frame around a piece of graffiti giving an oscar to uma thurman comparing your own movie to the great films of all time when its empty genrerehashing bubblegum trash he takes something which is so vacuous a simple revenge story and pretends its a great roman epic the result for some has been exhilaration if you could stand a second viewing i dont want to cry at your party dont keep reading for me it was one of great frustration qt loves crappy asian martial arts movies thats fine but what he doesnt realize is that those movies are so lovable because they arent presumptious they dont pretend theyre citizen kane or war  peace kb is the very definition of pretentious it dons fancy disguises pretty colours sound effects camera angles good music animation slow fadeins and outs it gives chapter names to halfhour long unnecessary sequences  all to pretend it is epic cinema but what substance is there a few action scenes exploitation violence and a thinasatampon revenge storyqt talks boy does he talk about fking with the audience  his words not mine imdb  but he can talk his way into a coma and it wont distract me from the fact that never in my life have i heard cornier dialogue and hammier acting and never in my life have i seen a more selfserving movie the audience might as well not even be here  tarantino only cares about amusing himself anyway you should have heard him laughing at his own movie at the premiere,cruel
vol1 is simply one of the best directed and best written movies i have ever seen tarantino as usual brings a lot of new ideas into the movie and the execution is flawless but its just too damn unrealistic too take seriously plot holes are everywhere which makes it hard to relate to a situation if the situation is wildly far fetched many movies have plot holes if not most but the flaws in are so blatant its embarrassing shouldve been one of the best movies of all time but its pitfalls are so obvious and stupid the film just cant cut it with the elite the opening scene got my attention like a plane crash but the opening scene is just the start of plot hole after plot hole couldve been brilliant,cruel
your typical overstylized bloodsoaked tarantino talkfest is sure to wow some but make others fall asleep upon awakening from a fouryear coma induced by a gunshot to the head does thurman rehibilitate no she flies all over the world slicing and dicing about twohundred people including those responsible for her near death i enjoyed the first ten minutes which actually contained a little realism something lacking in any tarantino effort then theres dialogue lulls an endless japanimation sequence sword battles resulting in more dead bodies than any friday the 13th film and those patented asinine kinds of lines only read in a tarantino film when do you want to die btch silly rabbitt trix are for other character finishes kids again the first few minutes seemed grounded in at least a bit of reality unfortunately this is followed by people flying and severed limbs that shoot gallons of blood while the victim rolls and screams and one person killing an army of menenough at least cheesefests like american ninja kept the hero somewhat able to be doing what he was doing here thurman so effortlessly hacks away at people in liveaction video game style that you just roll your eyes it is far far too long after the fact of the matrix and crouching tiger hidden dragon but again tarantinos fans and sadly bandwagon critics will feel this bigbudget studio horror film should take away an arm full of oscars,cruel
 vol 1 is a great work of art  despite the violent theme it is a ballet in cinema  the color is vibrant  the use of black and white photography is very well adapted  this technique helps to subdue the extreme violence toward the end of the movie  uma therman is magnificent in her portrayal of a young woman with revenge on her mind  her ability to perform the marshall arts is remarkable  her eyes are piercingly blue and her emotional presentation is perfect in her role  there are scenes that are totally done in cartoon and this too helps to allay the fears of the violent episodes that frequent this cinema  one must add this to their library of great films  this director is a true genius  if you have not seen it on the big screen the dvd is perfectly well done,cruel
first off i liked this movie visually intresting good if unoriginal story and fun i rented it a couple days before vol 2 came out and i enjoyed it enough to see v2 on opening night heres my problem if anyone but quentin tarantino made this film the critics wouldve killed it but because it was done by him it was innovative inspired and original the violence was cartoonish and fun which made the amount of fake blood spilled on screen easy to take the story was a standard revenge flick filled with interesting over the top tarantinoscenes i just find it funny that there seems to be a double standard for the critics and tarantinos treasure is another directors trash once again if you like revenge flicks styled after 70s kung fu and revenge movies youll love it i do recommend it,cruel
if one did not know going in that this was a tarantino movie one would be able to discern that fact within five minutes from the violence of the opening scene segueing to nancy sinatras haunting bang bang it would be obvious to all who know qts workthen we go right to a fight scene where she dispatches the 2nd person on her death list five what a deliciously funny moment when both characters have to pause their knockdown dragout catfight because a school bus carrying vernitas daughter pulls up right outsidethen we go back in time to the scene where the bride wakes from her coma and she exacts revenge on the orderly who had been pimping the coma patients for a few bucks who but qt would throw something that perverse in just for laughs i remember the first time i saw that scene when buck is explaining the rules to his wouldbe customer i said aloud to the screen boy you picked the wrong girl on the wrong goddamn daythe anime segment detailing orens origins was a very nice touch its been said that this whole film is a liveaction cartoon and having actual animation within it seems apropos from there we go to okinawa where the bride acquires the services of a retired swordmaker getting him to relinquish his vow to never create another instrument of death this scene was a little overly long but a wonderful precursor to the bloody scene that was to followand then at last the final third of the movie the showdown at the house of blue leaves one of the best fight scenes ever filmed some may find it gratuitously violent and rightly so but people offended by such things should have known better than to go see a qt movie in the first place such people may also take note that the most gratuitous part of the fight scene switched to bw so as to tone down the bloodiness of it without detracting from itmy best friend whose name was larry sadly passed away in the year 2000 he was an avid moviegoer  he loved spaghetti westerns he loved asian martialarts movies and he loved qt i look at this film and i know without a doubt that it would have made his list of alltime favorites and it saddens me that he never got to see iti must add that i was a little bit disappointed with kb2 though i didnt expect kb2 to be a carbon copy of kb1 it seemed to be lacking the campy spirit that kb1 had qts movies all have certain themes in common violent action wacky homages to his favorite genres and memorable dialogue in the scenes that are purely for exposition in my opinion kb1 is an outstanding movie because it had all three of these qualities kb2 is just okay because the exposition far outweighed the actionif gratuitous violence offends you or if blood and gore makes you squeamish then you should probably avoid this movie at all costs if on the other hand you like exploring what i like to call the dark underbelly of filmmaking which is the essence of qts work then you will love this movie and want to watch it over and over againmy score an unqualified 10,cruel
from beginning to end vol 1 is a bloody mess quentin tarantinos acclaimed 4th film unleashes all uma thurman as the bride has one of the best performances that ive seen for her career im so glad tarantino got michael madsen back in his movies because he was great in resevoir dogs taratino mixes kungfu with his insanely entertaining dialogue which is always a plus for me just listening to the way everything flows makes it that great of a movie the best part of this epic is the amount of blood shed uma takes down the whole crazy 88 and leaves a bloody mess what she did to oren ishiilucy liuwas pure masterful the music is awesome as well mixing like a techno type kungfu music produced by the rza this is a must see for everyone it shows the funnier side of death using cartoon like kills with a hose type spraying blood from a decapitated individual so see it you wont be disappointed1010,cruel
well what can be said about the best movie of 2003this film is the epitome of storytelling although it seems to be a simple revenge story the way it unfolds to the viewer is simply breathtaking tarantino is using flashbacks clever narration from uma thurman and even anime cartoons to make this story as cool as it can getwell yeah maybe theres not enough character depth and the classicly tarantinesque dialogues are missing but vol2 certainly makes up for itvol1 is certainly thrilling enough to stand as one movieand the semicliffhanger in the end is perfectly placedits a pity that tarantino decided to split the movie in two volumesthe uncut version must be even more godlike but i think i know why he split the film in half and released it in a 6 months space he wanted uma thurman to be nominated for both volumes and win two oscars with one movie lol too bad the academy ignored her cause she certainly deserved itthe moment where she wakes up from the coma and looks for her unborn child would be enough for me to knock on her door and give her the damn awardthe film also gets a 10 out of 10 as well,cruel
vol1 is quentin tarantinos best work since pulp fiction and uma thurmans best work ever  its a classic revenge tale in which thurmans character seeks revenge on the crew of assassins who tried to kill her thurmans character simply known as the bride was a former member of the crew who attempted to kill her  after the bride is attacked she goes into a comma for a few years she wakes up and only has only one thing on her mindrevenge  is the perfect combination of action comedy and japanese anime  uma thurman is excellent as the bride  lucy liu is great as the half chinese half american o ren ishii  quentin tarantino does it again  the entire film was good from beginning to end  i cant wait for volume 2 to come out later on this year  vivica a fox is awesome and lethal as vernita green  however david carradine fans will be disappointed  he is only in a couple scenes throughout the entire film hopefully we will see more of him and michael madsen in volume 2 overall i gave vol 1 an 8 out of 10  the action scenes were spectacular and i loved the japaneseanime sequences in the film  if people liked this movie i would recommend seeing reservoir dogs and pulp fiction,cruel
there are some exquisite shots in this film look out for the shot where the bride urm thurman goes into the washroom and hears sofie fatale julie dreyfus its just one long continuous shot no cuts check it outnow i know some the slash and hack can be a little gruesome but those sound effects are a killer arnt they sorry it could just be me but even throughout the gore it raised a smile soundtracks are a key feature in a tarintino film where merely they are often incidental to the action with tarintino they are often centre stage for example the soundtrack in the showdown between the bride and cottonmouth adds to the occasion especially in those settings with the water feature in and the gentle falling snow and doesnt oren ishii lucy liu show both the vulnerability and strength of the samari sword and by god she makes it look sexyfinally i admire the casual humour of tarinto one of which was seeing all those passengers on the plane with their samari swords holstered in the walkway parked as casually as umbrellas whilst the bride writes her kill list its little features like this that is the trademark of tarantino excellent film,cruel
i first hired this from blockbuster and i must say that this movie took my breath away the gore the acting and the martial arts was so cool and i have to say that i didnt know nothing about this movie until i got it i wont spoil it for you so ill not say no more quentin tarantino did an fantastic job on this movie and the only other time i have ever heard from him was when he costarred with george clooney in from dusk till dawn i do wish that no1 and no2 were put together though which would of made this movie even better the plot was the only problem with me the plot was about revenge but that was a minor flaw with the movie but apart from that this is a movie worth considering rated r18 for aussies for violence and gore,cruel
from the desperate cold inhumanity of a bride awakening to find she has been shot in the head and lost her baby to the bloody carnage that ensues vol 1 reeks of style tribute and intrigue  our heroine black mamba slices her way through the first half of her death list five restoring honor to her lost daughters name in true samurai oldschool fashion  the mere outline of all principle characters in this truly dark tale is 100 pathetic  these ruthless people these scumoftheearth assasins some even sadistic deserve to be hacked apart for what they have done with their lives the sheer brutality and satisfaction which arises from each gruesome battle will actually creep you out  thurman fleshes out the bride as a lethal hardass yet vulnerable international hitwoman a cult classic the day it was first shown in theatresvol 1 will take your breath away,cruel
as an avid fan of qt i was not disappointed with this moviei thought it was fantastic how he could combine many different elements bw colour cartoon in one movie without making it seem sloppy was geniusthe exaggeration of gore was absolutely fantastic it was like a blood fest but without the total seriousness of it all although the faint hearted might disagreefantastic casting as you would expectthe only thing that i would say is that it did not necessarily have to be done in 2 parts obviously it was a money thing but then again maybe it was too blood and gore for one sitting,cruel
what a great movietarantino combines several genres in this masterpiece ofvisceral eyecandy but i wouldnt call it a rip off as so many others have before me  for visual referencethink sergio leone directs crouching tiger hidden dragonuma thurman is fabulous as the near supernatural antihero  much likeeastwoods high plains drifterwe find ourselves cheering for this woman even though shes just as much of a bloodthirsty coldhearted bitch as the people shes vowed to gain her vengeance from  i think all the naysayers are confusing documentary and fiction with pureentertainment  thats what is so classic about tarantino he remembers whypeople go to watch films  a complete escape from reality with a few visually stunning fight scenes and an ending that compels you to rush out and watchvolume 2 as soon as possiblei had but one complaintand that was a scene early in the movie where thebride chews the fat small talk style with a japanese restaurant owner scene played out too long and was the only one that bordered on boring 910,cruel
after surviving an assassination attempt uma thurman decides to seek revenge and what revenge it is killing anybody and anything that stands in the way of this killing machine from the moment she wakes up from her coma we see a controlled evil streak immediately the killing streak begins even if at the start she is only half of her capable self i recommend this film to anybody who has a tendency to like violence it is also a must see for all the tarantino fans out there who just cant wait for his next film this film is full of blood guts and jaw opening twists so go out and rent this as soon as you can now this film will be talked about for years to come an immediate classic,cruel
i wasnt from the bruce lee era so i did not watch much quentin tarantinos movie i stumbled to this movie by accident and im glad i did i watch it purely based from my own instinct with no bias whatsoever boy i just love it i need to rewind to several parts to capture the moment the mix of graphics music words tog is so right and good i realize its a bloody movie and i admit there are parts where i was just shock like the scene where one of the super 88 got his fingers slice off by sword but its a bloody movie that is clean at the same time when i think of the movie i would think of the sword in the movie the sharpness and simplicity yet not really that simple i am not a fan of bloody and violent movie especially those ones that keep chopping cutting shooting people yet this movie is different they show the art the culture at the same time they show the action its not a boring movie although i admit there are some slow part where i want to fast forward the music is awesome again this movie is not for everyone some will love it and there will be some who just dont get it for me i really like this movie would be a shocker to my friends right now some of the scene still plays in my head very nice,cruel
typical quentin tarantino coolness has brought us yet another mainstream cult classic  multidimensional  complex characters all around uma blank mamba vivica copperhead and lucy liu cottonmouth are superbly written and well acted secondary characters are also written and executed well  a little play on words there lolthe plot is beyond good the acting is very good the writing is a indescribable melding of camp and quality  as usual the line between good and evil is blurred but there is a prevailing sense of right and wrong throughout vol 1direction is great  warning  this is an extremely violent movie with adult situations  some people will not be able to enjoy this movieacting 910  direction 910 plot 810 writing 910,cruel
i just saw this movie for the first time on dvd as a whole this movie has amazing cinematography and creativity its a cool homage to old spaghetti westerns japanese samurai anime etc i borrowed it from a friend but i can see myself owning it since i like those kinds of films with over the top violence you cant take it too seriously because its not done realistically and its fake from the getgo thats part of its charmon the other hand quentin tarantino tends to use overly crass subject matter and language just for the sake of being crass fans of tarantino would probably say what do you expect its quentin tarantino but i say why is it needed this movie was already good and stuff like that doesnt enhance the plot i dont mind movies that have some language andor crass subject matter if its done tastefully and at a bare minimum but the way tarantino does it is just jarring it stops the movie and prevents the plot from moving forward when it should theres just too much language at timesand its always the worst words used and that scene with the two guys either raping or wanting to rape black mamba while she was in a coma is just sick granted they didnt show anything thank god but their choice of words during that dialog that went on between them was just unsettling and its something id rather not hear about the subject is crass on its own so it didnt even need that 5 minute bit of dialog with them talking about it i have yet to find a good reason for that scene to even be there it didnt enhance the plot at all im absolutely positive that this scene as well as most of the language couldve been omitted and the film wouldve still be greatprobably better scenes like this and over the top bad language insult my intelligence the movie is perfectly fine without all that sorry if i have morals actually im not sorry but some things are just better left outthankfully most of the crude language and subject matter was gone after that and we got a magnificent blood bath of a movie with excellent choreograpy for the fight scenes wonderful cinematography and fun homages to japanese samurai movies anime spaghetti westerns etc the plot was clever and witty when the movie actually focused on the plotmy rating 810,cruel
uma thurman plays the main character known only as the bride tarantino insists on having her being recognized as the bride because when she introduces herself in the beginning her name was bleeped outanyway her wedding was abruptly crashed by her former gang the deadly viper assassination squad long enough name led by bill david caradine who we dont see but hear the brides gang killed everybody at her wedding but they failed to kill her now shes really pssed off and dedicates her next 250 or so minutes divided in half hence vol 1 to see to it that she kills billuma thurman is a likeable character and the film has a likeable story but this tarantino film is very much different to his previous work the atmosphere is a little too colorful as are the 30000 gallons of blood used throughout what i noticed is a slight lack in snappy dialogue although normally i wouldnt take to noticing this little aspect but being that its from the director who gave us pulp fiction there were dialogue standards that needed to be met i found the little annime sequence annoying it was well drawn and it fit with the mood of the film but the amount of blood was incredibly ridiculous the film excells on the bloody content as well the bride is pssed off i know but a few hundred gallons less of fake blood would have had the same effectin conclusion pulp fiction and reservoir dogs fans will enjoy vol 1 but perhaps not as much as the earlier stories13  out of ,cruel
it was a good movie overall with a great story line but there is too much violence and vulgarity i hated when in the movie uma thurman threw the knife at vivica a fox in front of her own child i hate vivica a fox i am so glad she died it was good also bill should have been her main victim in the movie at first instead of going to the deadly assassins i wished quentin tarintino saved lucy liu to be killed for last she got killed in such a brutal way its so bloody i also hated it when lucy lius hot bodyguard died too she was so innocent i wish daryl hannah died instead of lucy liu i loved it when the assassins walked in to the church and massacred the whole place it was great even though it was really bloody there was too much blood shed though i hated that part,cruel
on the day of her wedding a former assassin uma thurman is shot and left for dead by her colleagues vivica a fox daryl hannah lucy liu michael madsen julie dreyfuss and boss the unseen bill david carradine four years later she wakes up from a coma and seeks revenge on the assassins responsible leaving behind a trail of dead bodiesoriginally released as one fulllength film but split in two by order of miramax quentin tarantinos revenge tale is a salute to spaghetti westerns martial arts films and 70s action films after a sixyear break tarantino has not lost his style he still knows how to make mindless bloody films although its stupid silly trashy and bloody its entertaining more to follow in vol 2 my evaluation  out of ,cruel
leave the limbs youve lost they belong to me now the bridevol 1 is a very good movie one of the best of 2003 however it isnt exactly a masterpiece without vol 2 the plot concerns a bride who is betrayed on her wedding day she is left for dead and four years later she wakes up from her coma she plots to kill the five people who tried to kill her and especially bill vol 1 is one of the bloodiest movies ive ever seen i have seen vol 2 and with the extension of that makes an instant classic both work good on their own but i dont consider vol 2 a sequel quentin tarantino once again writes a great script and selects a great cast uma thurman is great in her role as the bride with the unknown name vol 1 is a smart and brutal revenge tale that will if nothing else entertain you 910 stars,cruel
we used a coupon for a free rental in order to see this just because we have seen art style craftsmanship and entertainment value in some of qts other flix  it turns out that we got exactly what we paidfor with kb except were in the hole for the time we wasted on this fistful of crouching matrix yeah it was good for a few laughs as the sendup some would say ohmaj that im certain must have been intended  start here uma thurman as a samuraitype swordsperson  give me a compound fracturezero out of 10  not recommended and if you even mention 2 to me im gonna retch all over your shoessomeone else said it best to paraphrase and elaborate quentin tarantino shame on you you selfindulgent idiot back on the wagon with you,cruel
i thought id hate this film over the top violence isnt my thing finally decided i should give it a try and liked it so much i rented it twice so my wife could see it too since i am not an afficionado of hong kongstyle or japanesestyle or any other style action movies and havent ever seen a bruce lee movie etc im illiterate in the matter of all the homages tarantino was paying but i know a good story line when i see one and the thing that was so interesting to me was that i found myself really caring about the uma thurman black mambo character and rooting for her in her justifiable quest for revenge considering what a killing machine she was that was quite an accomplishment maybe tarantino is just punk hype and maybe hes only made 6 films to date including vol2 but hes visually arresting and makes you ask why you identify with certain inherently evil characters when others say tony soprano fill you with revulsion as to the mayhem it was just a cartoon and not at all objectionable to anyone over the age of 6,cruel
this movie is without a doubt one of the best revenge flicks ever made even though the story maybe very very simple it is perfectly executed with pure tarintino style the blood the severed limbs the limitless tributes by tarintino kung fu and western genres he is a genius i have to admit when i went to see this movie in the theatres i knew it was quite violet and bloody and i thought ugg am i gonna like this but having liked every movie quentin tarintino has ever made i managed to get there well i wasnt disappointed from the opening scene in black in white with a savagely beaten woman in a wedding dress who we come to call the bride with the very sassy and deep voice of david carradine as bill the scene sets the stage for a hell of a ride that takes us from pasadena california all the way to the house of blue leaves in tokyo japan now i may not be a pro movie critic but i know when i like something and this i definitely liked the music was absolutely amazing even though hardly any of it original it is quentins way of paying homage to the films and genres he loved growing up as a kid the cast was just amazing uma thurman probably her best performence of her career darryl hannah had like 5 mins of screen time and used it too its full potential i loved volume 1 and i loved volume 2 even more 1010 quentin you are a movie genius and i cant thank you enough for your contributions to cinema,cruel
i was reluctant to see this film hearing reports that it is simply an excuse to watch a lot of gore i think it is important to remember that there is a lot of stupid gratuitous violence out there but tarentino rarely fails to raise this standard a notch i dont have a problem with gore as long as its interesting creative filmiclyinteresting gore which most definitely was as hoped for there is suspense humor interesting unexpected twists and even the predictable is brilliantly carried out a lack of realistic assessment of umas probable injuries after her fight with gogo barley bothered me now i can finally see volume 2 which i hear is great,cruel
from the opening scene to the credits at the end this wicked film is so powerful it will pull you into a world of pain uma thurman is sensational as the bride lucy liu is startlingly psychotic as oren ishii daryl hannah is so evil you have to see to believe and vivica a fox is just the average kung fu kicker in this extremely gory extremely fun film uma plays your average bride to be whos whole wedding party are killed by an organisation she used to work for after being shot in the head she still manages to live and wakes up to take out her own personal and brutal revenge from the fight scene between uma and vivica to the half hourish battle between uma and hundreds of japanese ninjas it is great fun to watch and unforgettable i liked the big ninja fight scene were uma cuts of their heads arms and legs its so graphic it will take your breath away i will give this 10 out of 10 because its wicked i havent seen the sequel yet but will get it on dvd the day its released,cruel
if you like death anime blood gushing swordplay black and white scenes some grim bits badass fight scenes great quotes and great music watch this film story bride uma wants to leave the group deadly viper but bill its leader likes her too much and kills the weeding party she lives and 4 years later gets out of a coma cue all of the above happening including limbs being cut off and up to 100 people dying so she can get to everyone who like these things should view this movie and the sequal 2 if you like blood i also recomend 28 days later wich has grim and bloody bits too however this might be a bit grim for some basically if you havnt seen what are you playing at eh see it now,cruel
as i heard that quentin tarantino made a new movie i couldnt wait to see it quentin tarantino was already one of my favorite directors and after seeing vol 1 he went right to the top i have never had such a great cinema experience the time went by so easily that i couldnt believe that a almost two hour movie was endedvol 1 went in on my top 20 cause of its brutality simplicity and the way the music fits so perfect i wont say that i didnt expect this movie to be something special cause tarantino have never disappointed me with his former movies reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown which is all brilliant tarantino hold his standard he surely made a modern masterpiece910,cruel
was an amazing as soon as i saw the preview i thought that the movie sounded so dumb that it would be out of the theater in a week i didnt go see it at the theater the critics had good things to say about the movie so i decided to see it at the student movie theater later that year i loved it i loved how it was for girls and guys even as bloody as it is i see it as more like a movie that just took a lot of talent to make uma gave such a performance if it was any other movie without so much blood she could have gotten a nomination from the academy the music goes so well with the movie i get goosebumps maybe uma can get nominated for vol ii,cruel
possible spoilers tarantinos mix of of various styles has led to a new genre its a strange mix of martial art spaghetti western he even used the typical leone close ups and straight comedy most directors would have produced a flop but not tarantino he selected the right actors for their surreal parts  daryl hannah is great to watch as the killer bitch scenes like the sun glasses in the police car really made me laugh as the scene with the sword master and his son the girls band 567 and 8 playing during the grand final are a big laugh uma made an excellent performance in her physical demanding role the film is highly entertaining and worth while difficult to capture in words just watch it 810,cruel
has been deemed as a violent bloody revenge film but it is so much more than that though some may say that this movie is nothing but nonstop fighting bloodying and limb severing i strongly disagree this movie is a visual piece of complex art the fight scenes are done in a gorgeous way with awesome sets and interesting charactersthough this movie is intensely violent it is not disturbing violence the overthetop blood waterfall when limbs are severed actually seems to lighten the movie this movie does not have the brutal realistic violence that certain horror movies and movies like the passion of christ include due to its tribute to old cheesy revenge flicks the violence is something that most every can handle i for instance am easily disturbed by violence however this movie didnt bother me or disgust me at allmost adults enjoy this movie but it is not just them i too am a big fan of this movie even though i am only 13 and unlike many my age i was not interested in this for the violence i liked the idea of the plot and when i saw this movie i was definitely not disappointed the interesting combination of great lighting amazing camera angles and stunning sets made this a visually attractive movie i found myself glued to the screen very happy with what i sawi would definitely recommend this movie it seems to be a movie that people of all ages and of both genders can both enjoy this movie so if you have not seen volume one yet run dont walk to your nearest video store,cruel
vol 1 is a true cult film which can be classified in the same category as the bruce lee films never tire of watching it and i hope that vol 2is just as good beatrix kiddo only mentioned as the bride in vol 1 is set upon by her former lover and boss bill played by grasshopper david carradineas well as 4 other deadly assassins luy liu vivica fox micheal madsen and darryl hannah she wakes up after a 4 year coma with one aim  revenge on each of her assilants the action scenes are mind blowing especially the showdown prior to the combat with lucy liu  that scene in intself is worth the price of admission this is one of the best films ever 10 out of 10 ,cruel
quentin tarantino is the master  as a fan of his genius i can only say bravo  you have struck gold againvol 1 is cinematic art at its best  uma thurman kicks butt literally as an assassination survivor out for revenge  and she looks great too prancing around in her bruce lee yellow leather outfit  i wish i had looked that great a year after having a baby  the film jumps around ala pulp fiction but what do you expect  this is after all a tarantino film  any other director would not have dared put in so much bloodspraying and whacking off of body parts  and this isnt even a horror moviethe cherry on top of the cake was the casting of david carradine as bill yes  all kung fu fans the world round are cheering  and we dont even get to see him but we know  oh we know  i can hardly wait for volume 2 so i can see the resolutionwhat else can i say that hasnt already been said in so many other reviews if you are a fan of tarantino films you will love his efforts here  he delivered exactly what he promised  a great filmrank 10,cruel
unfortantly i didnt get enough time to see this in theaters so i watched it on dvd and i have to say this probably tarintanos best film since pulp fiction the plot is probably what you would find in a usual hong kong action flick revenge over someone blah blah sword fights and revenge but the sword fights are probably the best since crouching tiger minor spoliersthough one thing i do have to ask about how the hell do people lose about one hundred gallons of blood and are still crawling around also what is with the anime scene sure its cool but it dosent really make sense to have an anime sceneoverall this a great film to blow off a couple of hours just be warned that if you have a squemish stomach dont buy many snacksoverall 8210,cruel
i dont know if its me thats changed but ive never made it more than 20 minutes through pulp fiction reservoir dogs nauseated me because i hate gratuitously violent films and natural born killers crept upon me when i had fallen asleep after a drinking session at a friends house and left me with no desire to do anything other than continue sleepingmaybe i just watched them all at the wrong timesvolume 1 however now thats different  like a lot of people i didnt know much about it until i heard a review for volume 2  i got hold of a copy of 1 and watched it last night  its the best entertainment ive had this year  i was riveted to the screen  uma thurman is truly excellent and in a film full of charactures she comes across as a real person  stunning  or maybe thats a worrying comment on my own perception at any rate the point was well and truly got acrossthis is no average film in any way  yes the violence is horrific i found myself thinking what on earth am i watching this monstrous film for but unable to stop watching it  it is done in such a stylised often tongueincheek and sometimes outright funny way that its simply about conveying a message the anger  and that is achieved in no uncertain terms this is a simple raw revenge tale made interesting by my sympathy with thurmans character  it is horrific but its about righteous anger and fury and that makes it seem almost okay  thurman efficiently got me on side very early on and from then on its goodies and baddies really good gripping stuff  i dont know what that says about me and i dont care to analyse myself too much there who cares if they bleed all over the place theyre the baddies and they deserve it thats how it should work isnt it and i for one cant wait to see vol 2 to find out just what happens nextloved it loved it loved it,cruel
quentin tarantino has thrilled us with many of his ground breaking movies and now he has shook the lives of others once again by unleashing upon the public this style of samurai hitmen has really shown quentin tarantinos abilities he has made a modern day hitmen movie with almost no guns the bloody style in which uma thurman executes her enemies is truly enjoyable but uma isnt the only one who rules the screen orenishii who is played by lucy liu is 1 on umas kill listbill being 5 i must admit there are some guns but the way uma thurman kills all of her enemies in a style of revenge  is so much better than being shot as quentin put itrevenge is a dish best served cold,cruel
the movie was amazing for me because when i was a kid on the seventies i used to go to the cinema to see that horrible chinese karate movies specially the ones with bruce lee a childhood herowhen just started and i mean the first 10 seconds suddenly i felt like i was a kid again it was incredible how much details from that movies you can find in a single shot besides the tarantinos way to tell a story is very funnyi just loved the anime it remind me the katsuhiro otomo animes akira for instance but a little bit harderi am anxious to see the second part here in brazil only in october god,cruel
i can not believe ive been avoiding to see this movie only bc of the suggestive title  i always thought that a movie called would be as dull as the title i was so wrong im not a tarantino fan in fact ive never seen any of his movies so i had no clue what this movie was going to be like in fact i never even saw a trailer from this movieso anyways this movie is so packed with action from the beginning until the very end  it doesnt have a very big plot its all about revenge and how to perform it  but whatever lacks in plot this movie makes up in action and the screenplay  it is so good  even for simple things like pussy wagon its just great so clever so creative so originalwell uma thurman is perfect as the bride shes so versatile when she needs to show anger she does when she needs to show sorrow she does and when she needs to show brutality she does indeed  lucyliu was so good as oren ishii another member of the deadly viper team  that you end up liking her  i never expected to see her playing a character like oren such a change but that shows how great lucy liu is not only she can play an ally mcbeal lawyer lol but also an evil and ruthless yakuza boss and mercenary  i also enjoyed very much vivica fox performance even though she had a small part but it was pretty good  daryl hannah was outstanding in her very small part as elle driver my favorite scene is when she shows up you know when im not going to spoil it  i havent had the chance to see david carradine as bill yet but i guess itll be terrific and i have to mention the girl who plays gogo i have no idea what her name is but wow she was very well casted as orens lunatic bodyguard  only by her eyesm you can tell that she doesnt know the meaning of the words compassion or fear  bravo to herwell the music is great very well picked for every scene and situation the characters are very interesting each one of them even the ones that are not that important  i definitely loved the screenplay the dialogs are smart i didnt find not even one unnecessary line  the locations are equally good the costumes the brides final suit the yellow and black one is awesome  i just put it simple  this movie is well done in every sensethis movie is indeed my favorite movie right now  1010 ps if blood scares you avoid this movie lol,cruel
spoilersbut lacks a good story  or that much of a plot  but where it lacks in story it makes up by art house editing  definately r rated  the story is a bit of a mish mash though and thats why i cant give it a full 10 even if i wanted to  its utterly confusing mud  it has some good music  but the movie is sorely lacking in details  its also very obvious that this movie should never have been split  miramax made a greedy move by splitting them  i havent seen volume 2 i sure as hell hope they join these films back together someday on dvd or hdvd810 quality 810 entertainment 1010 replayable 1010,cruel
ok so it is not an actual anime series but this movie was pure genius you have got to give quinten tarintino his props  and this was only part 1uma thurman is excellent as the bride  the rest of the cast is also class a especially david caradinne as the cool and mysterious bill  that action sequences are some of the best i have seen in a while bloody and down right cool  if you love samurai action and the scenery of japan youll definantly love this film  other than that you have to see it for yourself to see how great it is  see it then go see part 2 right away this twopart story arc is what the matrix reloaded and the matrix revolutions wanted to be like,cruel
there could be something here that amounts to a spoiler but theres not much mystery about or in to spoilsomebody in special effects decided that humans have enough blood and pressure to spray like a broken fire hydrant if a body part gets hacked off it is so unreal it is in a way less disturbing than a realistic depiction the best example is the accountant that loses an arm if you think about what ensues she lost enough blood for 10 peoplethe massive sword fights make it clear that the heroine is invincible executing perfect multiple dismemberments leaps and bounds that peter pan would be proud of while barely breaking a sweat except for just a few of the top evildoers armies of swordspeople have no chance against her there mustve been some criminals only get swords rule in effect because hardly any guns were used at allthe best fights are the oneonone duels starts off with a kickass fight sequence that would be the grand finale for lesser moviesthe fights are the only reason to watch there was one scene though that reminded me of samurai submarine sandwich shop or whatever that comedy skit was called they didnt quite go through with chopping up the food with a sword but i thought they might and it wouldve been hilarious tarentino has such a sick sense of humor it probably wouldnt have fit in but if you can get past the bloodsprays theres more ultradark comedy here than it may first appeari gave an 810 or 87 a brick or two shy of excellent but it might go up if 2 delivers,cruel
i was really disappointed with this movie let me start off first with i love anime and this movie was kinda like watching live action anime before i saw this movie i would have thought that idea was sweet now i realize that it just doesnt work and came out really egotistical and cheesy i did love however the old school kungfu movie style that he went after maybe the movie was just too hyped up for it to live up to my expectations maybe it just wasnt as good as people hyped it up to be the catch is now i have to see the second one just to see what happensa fact that im not really happy about at least i know that i dont have to spend 1000 to see it in theaters updatei take it all back after i saw the second one it tied everything together for me if it was all one long a movie i would have loved it,cruel
quentin tarantino probably is the only director to get away with a movie like its basically an ultraviolent oneidea movie but done with stylemovie starts of with a bang literally as the bride uma thurman is almost killed on a massacre at her wedding where the notorious bill killed 9 people including the groom and the minister apparently we dont know why he did it or who the bride really is we have to just go along with itthe bride wakes up after a coma and decides to and his female helpers the biggest part of the movie concentrates on the bride wanting to kill oren ishii lucy liu who is introduced in a great way into the film with a short extremely violent anime great stuffrest of the movie mainly consists of the bride slicing and chopping everybody that comes in her way death count must be about equal to commando and those kinds of movies there isnt a real story in it we just have to wait for part 2 for that i suppose hell it even has a cliffhanger you would only see on days of our lives and comparable soap operasin short stylish violent fragmentaric good stuff but one would expect more 710,cruel
look theres much been said about the merits of this film and my two bobs worth isnt going to change anyones mind but stuff it this is tarantinos best yet and thats saying something because almost all his work to date has been outstanding ive just watched it for the second time and there are so many little things that pay homage to some of cinemas greats this alone is worth the price of entry but on top of that the imagery character definition special effects filmwork etc is quite extroadinary definately one of my all time favourits cant wait to see the next episode,cruel
if you are looking for an intricate plot skip if you dont like gratuitous violence skip if you dont like martial arts movies skip now for the rest of us this is one of most fun and exciting films ive ever seen uma thurman is gorgeous and angry the action scenes which could have failed miserably without real martial artists were great ive seen reviews where people complain about menial things like there are no swords on planes and that much blood wouldnt spray out newsflash  hot blondes dont come out of comas after 4 years and kill over a hundred people with a mystic sword either its like seeing king kong and complaining that apes dont grow that big,cruel
first of all im a die hard tarantino fan  loved every film hes touched so far and 12 are no exceptions loved it from the opening quote to the climactic  fight at the end  but watching volume onea second time im left with a nagging question  who is the japanese swordmen who kills orens father its not the yakuza boss this character fails to meet any kind of revenge or followup but appears to be the most important character in the room is the focus on him just a strange stylized thing is he a character later on in the film or did i just miss something  ive seen vol 2 but it failed to explain this  i think there has got to be something behind this any ideas,cruel
ever since the disappointing jackie brown in 1997 film fans have been wandering what ever happened to that tarantino fella that every young new movie director tried to imitate well the answer is that he was writing along with the lovely uma thurman his story of bloody revenge that is known as vol 1 the basic plot is that a character known only as the bride is left for dead in a texas chapel on her wedding day along with 8 other unfortunates it also transpires that she is pregnant with the would be killers child the bill of the title 4 years later she wakes up in a hospital bed  then goes on a violent bloody  at times hilarious revenge rampage thats it in a nut shell  the results are absolutely magnificent from the opening cat fight with vernita green vivacia fox to the incredible  i mean incredible showdown with the crazy 88 the films pace is relentless it thunders from set piece to set piece wreaking havoc on the senses but be warned the film is not for those of a weak constitution it contains some of the most outrageous bloody  over the top violence ever put on to celluloid but that is where qts wicked sense of fun comes to the fore the violence is so gloriously gory  ott that you cant help but laugh at its absurdity there is also a beautiful crafted  imagined flashback sequence done in animated manga style that is possibly the highlight of this near masterpiece i say near masterpiece because there are a couple of minor grievances i have with this movie the characters all seem a little 1 dimensional in fact they are almost cartoon like so you dont really care about any of them a great deal also there isnt any of the usual tarantino snappy dialogue that you almost take for granted with the great man there is also the im sure ive seen this before somewhere feeling you get whilst watching this movie if you are a fan of old samurai or kung foo films you will recognise alot of nods to some of the eastern classics bruce lees yellow jump suit in game of death being an obvious one those small gripes aside old banana chin has come up with the goods once again  you can forget about all the cgi nonsense that was so obvious in the matrix reloaded what you see on screen in is a masterclass in choreography timing  gushing blood fountains magnificent buy it,cruel

quentin tarantino makes good movies no question about it hes a remarkably consistent if far from prolific filmmaker his movies are always entertaining visually dazzling and usually feature very sharp dialogue tarantino also deserves credit for not underestimating his audiences intelligence in an era when most films are dumbeddown to the lowest common denominator tarantino bravely employs nonlinear narratives confident that the audience can keep upthis evidently is enough to garner him a devotedeven fanaticalfollowing amongst film buffs if the position of his films on the imdb top 250 list is any indication but perhaps thats a sad commentary on just how bad most hollywood dreck is because ive always found that while good tarantinos movies are never greatvol 1 showcases all the tarantino qualities i mentioned above but also displays all of his usual shortcomings his failures come down to two things for me a lack of heart and a lack of originalitythe lack of heart shows itself in the consistently unlikeable characters it isnt just the foul language and lack of redeeming qualities in the case of the bride were never given a chance to really warm up to the character all we know is she was pregnant and wanted to get married and then got beat within an inch of her life why why did all those assasins try to kill her maybe she deserved it she was and is a pretty formidable assasin herself who knows we sure dontgranted this is probably deliberate on tarantinos part he likes complicated characters especially antiheroes and leaving out some backstory elements is part of his respect for the audiences intelligence and imagination but he often errs too much on the side of restraint with his character development the only reason i care if the  bride succeeds in her mission is so that the really cool cartoonstyle carnage can keep going i dont really care about the character tarantino hasnt given me a chance toevidently on purpose that emotional distance keeps me from making an emotional investment in the filmtarantino also loses marks when it comes to originality its not that hes wholly unoriginal far from it pulp fiction was pretty strong in that regard its just that the guy is such a film buff that his movies are pretty much pastiches of other flicks when i watch a tarantino flick i get the uncanny feeling that ive seen this film beforein a more linear format perhaps and with less foul language but its a retread it makes his movies predictible and vol 1 is especially guilty of this i know the bride will meet up with each of her enemies and after a visually stunning kickass spectacle ultimately get her revenge no surprises theretarantino is obviously devoted to duplicating the martial artsspaghetti westerns hes ripping offoops sorry hes paying homage to them silly me but that costs him in vol 1 as well unlike his previous movies his devotion to duplicating their stilted speech means theres none of the crackling dialogue that made pulp fiction such a joy to listen to despite the often needlessly excessive profanityim not saying tarantino sucks far from it i like watching his movies i just think they and he are vastly overrated good but not greatanyway im not going to rush out and see vol 2 i can wait until its on dvd i do want to see it but my patience is the strongest evidence of how tarantino intrigues me but ultimately leaves me cold 710,cruel
i mistakenly posted this comment originally on vol 2  it was meant for vol 1take for what it is  good escapetionist entertainment and you have good chances to enjoy it judge it according to art cinema criteria and you risk to not like it and miss the fun terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong placeis a revenge story as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the western history there is not too much originality in the story  what is different is the art of film making the smart mix of quotes from all what terentino likes in the history of cinema from spaghetti westerns to classic japanese samurai films the soundtrack and of course the unmistakable touch of noncensored violence so typical to terentinooverall the film is entertaining i saw it on dvd and i cannot wait for volume 2 release on dvd so i intent to see it tomorrow in the theater 810 on my personal scale,cruel
when i first saw the trailer i thought this movie was going to be the typical jackie chan rubbish movie i went with a friend and saw it and i loved it this is a very particular type of film this is a very good film not in the scene of amazing masterpieces such as requiem for a dream a clockwork orange in america lost in trnaslation this film is completly different this film is charged with unrealistic battle scenes gallons of fake blood and lots more but this is a very good cult film an anthology which colects all those martial arts moves and join them to create this the photography again is outstanding the character design and development is amazing oren ihii fantastic elle driver quentin and uma create characters so deep such as luci lus character dark evil but at the same time calm and always full of rage elle driver is a bit more trashy more rude and the scene in the hospital is very memorable this is a must see film 9351000,cruel
i think that this quote from film maker tarantino perfectly captures and its endless references to other films the excess references artful or annoying i still have not decidedsome of the things that follow tarantino films make my skin crawl for example the rabid fans the geeks with their black tshirts and their obsessive record and dvd collections the ones that refer to the director as qt another example would be all the fashion crap that seems to travel vain celebrities who hope to get noticed by being at qts premieres i hate hollywood will there now be a million duplicates of i hope noti have extremely mixed feelings about tarantino and his films his movies are ultraviolent with little redeeming value shows tarantino to be a kind of godard of violence the problem with a film like is that it seems that you really have to be a teenager to enjoy the movie i am sure many adolescent males will love this film along with its cult movie flavors reminded me of when i first discovered manga i thought it was the cool new thing at the time anything with superviolence appeals to you when you are a teenager i am  older now and have left manga and comics behind but this film and its popularity  proves that some people still reside at this developmental point what is with all the comic book filmsmy main complaint of is like a comic book there is no psychological depth to any of the characters the figures in this film could all be action figures from your local walmart the plot is that a woman goes to get married in texas her old assassin pals show up and kill everyone at the wedding chapel the bride is left for dead but survives she proceeds to enact revenge by killing literally hundreds of peoplethat is the movie in all its simplicity that is why bugs me the film is like a glossy magazine for people with add it is pretty glossy with beautiful people plastered all over it but it has absolutely no depth what is interesting is that tarantino films used to be synonymous with clever dialogue reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were cool because they had some interesting dialogue remember steve buscemi as mr pink remember samuel l jackson and the path of the righteous man  yeah that was some cool dialogue moreover the films of tarantino all speak like he does in that motormouth random fashion in the dialogue is very minimal which actually surprised methe major factor in this film is that it is a 70s or 80s action film that has all the terrible idiocy taken out it is a delta force with no chuck norris it has high production values good acting superb direction and nice choreography in other words it is everything an action film is not but it is also as standard as any action film gets this is exhibited by the usual revenge plot that we the viewer have observed so many time in other action filmstarantino must be congratulated for making an action film that is not stale this standard action flick still manages to be fresh even though the material is not it is well filmed and i liked the animation sequences but animation interjected into a live action film is a double edged sword because it reinforces the idea that you are watching nothing more than a comicbook for me it makes the film seem like it lacks depth what is interesting here is that there is another film that suffered  from the same problem as that film was natural born killers actually written by tarantino but directed by oliver stone  the film threw in a lot of things including an animation sequence this  detracted from nbk and made it seem even more shallow than it was the constant insertion of different styles detracted from the film most notably the dysfunctional family sequence set to a sitcom formathowever is the better film and there are some good things about it the fact that you have some damn fine looking woman fighting this is always a good thing samarai swords and swordfights are cool there is no way of getting around that fact i thought it was quite amusing to have a kung fu fight set in a domestic setting there was another cool bit where the bride tells a young gangster off by smacking his bottom with a sword this is what get for messing with the yakuza  you go girl there is another great bit where the japanese swordmaker states that if god were in a swordfight with the bride and his sword god itself would be cut this is a nice touch and reminds the viewer that tarantino still has his dark sense of humorbut the main problem with this film is exhibited by the final part of ultimately the movie is one long video game it reminded me of  when i played enter the matrix on the playstation two but then i have never really been a kung fu movie fan is a film that will not linger in my mind it is not my kind of film but at the same time i can recognize tarantinos talent this is volume one and i dont really care what happens in volume two i was pretty indifferent to the characters because they had the character development of wwf wrestlers i kept expecting the rock to appear at some stage but in a film such as this who wants character development watching a film like makes me want to see something character driven like six feet under to compensate i give this a 7 out of 10 and feel a definite ambivalence,cruel
quentin tarantino has the ability to write scripts which end up being highly original despite hundreds of homages to other moviesdirectors follows that exact formula original yet it contains so many homages you could probably not count them allthe plotline is once upon a time there was a girl called black mamba she was part of the deadly viper assassination squad however she wanted out and tried to settle down and get her own family thats when the founder of the dvas attacked with the rest of its members killing everyone at black mambas wedding including black mamba from now on referred to as the brideunfortunetly for the dvas the bride did not die she survived however she did end up in a coma for four years but when she finally wakes up she goes on a killing spree killing everyone who stands in her way for revenge her first targets are venitra green and oren ishii both former members of the dvasthis film is violent theres no doubt about it in the climax battle blood is sprayed everywhere altough you cannot take this violence seriously just one short sequence of the fight three members of the evil guys team yell franaticly wave their swords in the air and run down the stairs just to be instantly killed by the bride in a second or so all of this including the violence looks incredibly corny intentionally and funny its almost sick how perfect this movies mood is one could say that this is definetly one of the best movies ever just because of scenes like thatthe acting in this film is good even though no real room is given for the characters to really go allout the directing and editing are topnotch among the best ive seen the writing is also good as the movie jumps from past to present in a series of flashbacks or montages the soundtrack is very fitting and quentin has thrown in several songs that are so good that they make you really want to own the soundtrack something i noticed in this film more than any other is that the music and sound editing here is also perfect usually something like that goes mostly unnoticed but here its obviously well done and adds to the twisted and wierd feeling of the movietheres not awhole lot more to say about this movie one has to see it for themselves so i urge you to do so1010,cruel
i want to start out and say that this film was good in a way but sucked the film was over the top of violence  i love violence but what bugged me is how they cut to black and white for no reason  i stated in my review for vol 2 that i thought the black  white worked to represent past  present here i figured i would have expected the same thing but out of now where in the last fight with crazy 88s it jumps to black and white which made me mad  there was no reason for it if he had cut down on the blood he wouldnt have had to do that  tarantino is a bad filmmaker  he has blood gush out like a constant spray yeah thats wrong blood doesnt do that those parts were over the top  he probably figured he had money why not blow it all on crap effects  the other thing the irritated me was the stupid animation to tell the story of that one chick i forgot her name that was a waste of money  it would have been more affective if it was like action with real people  the story was good but how he slapped it together sucked  people talk about it getting nominated for an oscar i dont think it should have made it to dvd  i liked the second one a whole lot better than this  i watched this to gt a little more feedback on whats happening in 2  this film should make tarantino got down as the work filmmaker of all times,cruel
this movie has a lot of references the films of sergio leone kungfu and godzilla movies blaxploitation films japanese anime and specifically the french movie the bride wore black even with all of these elements the movie exists unto itself there is no selfreferential winking the audience is drawn into the films seamless reality without questionuma thurman is magnificent as the bride her vengeful drive is focused and unsentimental her will is unstoppable while many wrongs have been done to her she is not a victim she is a survivor with a wrathbesides uma thurman my favorite performances are lucy liu oren ishii and julie dreyfus sophie fatale lucy liu is real and brilliant in the role of the immaculate boss of the japanese crime underworld julie dreyfus is perfect as the beautiful and multilingual coconspiratorwitnessthe movie is dark and gruesome but not in a salacious way it works and it works well,cruel
oh yeah its about revengenegative comments about this movie seem to pertain to there being a lack of plot and dialogue  some critics think that the film is incomplete everything about it however is intentional  less dialogue gives more time to action the plot is simplistic on purpose and the movie may be seen as incomplete because it is the first half of a twopart storythe film reminded me more of lock stock and two smokin barrels than pulp fiction  but then again barrels reminded me a bit of pulp fiction when i first saw it  at its worst vol 1 is matrixy with its huge fight scene involving the brideuma thurman against the countless foes of the crazy 88  at its best is a fantastic action packed movie that takes on the look and feel of japanese animeand there is even a short section that is animated  the fight scene pitting the bride against oren ishii looks like a state of the art fighting game on the xbox gaming console  so much style and popculture references arise throughout that i dont know if this is on purpose or not  tarantino keeps the movie in its own world where japanese steel is used to make a sword that is the ultimate weapon  the world is similar to ours in the 21st century but it follows different guidelines we see guns used but only in certain situations  the sword is the honorably weapon of choicethurman liu and crew do a great job at doing what they are suppose to do which is look tough act cool seem passionate about whats going on and be beautiful,cruel
this movie sure was a nice surprise i usually go to movies with an expectation of what the movie wants to be i would never enter a movie theater to watch pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl 2003 and expect a fellini movie i was expecting a nice action movie and full of references what i watched was simply much betterin terms of popculture references qt just have outdone himself the movie hints this before the actual opening credits the intense rhythm of the movie never stops and i would bet that if did had 4 hours those would seem more like 10 minutes i have the distinct impression that if i would even blink i would loose entire scenesthe plastic aspect of the movie just out made my favorite plastic directors tim burton and peter greenaway every frame is beautiful and careful thought and even when using outdated effects that look awful but cool in those b movies he made miraclesi cant wait to see the sencond part but considering that the first part took a hole year to find its way to brasil,cruel
quentin tarantio has crafted here a marvelously blended satirical swipe at the combined easternwestern action movieand it is pure pure genius in its every detail this was not made to be watched once i know that i will certainly see it several more timeshowever if youre looking for a description before seeing it well its like a charlies angles gone bad plus mission impossible plus thus wonderfully ridiculous kungfu type action films subtitled decorated with an anime and more fake blood than the original blade and the music the music is this absurdly beautiful blends of morricone  the eastwoodleone trilogy and eastern instrumentals wonderful uma thurman is just well just so uma lucy liu number one on mambas hit parade plays a perfect tarantino heavyin fact the construct the structure the vonnegut like out of sequence event line that will tease the curiosity out of you is his best yetall in all this is the best tarantino to date and ive just got to see vol 2,cruel
this is a good action film uma thurman kicks some butt in this movie and her acting is good lucy liu does well as a member of the murder squad underthe mysterious bill played by david carradine the stunts are good in this as well as robert richardsons cinematography thurman plays a woman whogoes on a revenge mission to kill the people responsible for attacking her for all those men she faught near the end im surprised they didnt just quit and give up after thurman killed the first five but it kept the movie going  i recommend this movie out of ,cruel
quentin tarantino has a very unusual way of directing a movie relying on inspirations from martial artbruce lee movies and other classic japanese films but he does know how to borrow this genre and work it in his films volume 1 is a good example uma thurman who became a star after pulp fiction another tarantino film plays a character known simply as the bride you have to see vol 2 to find out her real name she plays a hired assassin and is a member of the deadly vipers assassination squad divas get it the bride finds out she is pregnant and decides to give up the lifestyle of being an assassin and now wants to live a normal life but during her wedding her boss bill and the other members of the divas crash the ceremony kill everyone in the church and leave the bride for dead a few years later she wakes from her coma and begins her quest for vengeance by going after her boss bill and the rest of the assassins the movie tends to go over the top in terms of violence that in some occasions its comical the actors though are first rate david carradine of the hit show kung fu lucy lui vivica a fox and daryl hannah but the film belongs to thurman who i believe gives her best performance since pulp fiction has some terrific action sequences and terrific camera work one final note this movie is rated r for good reasons so kids should not see this i give it an a,cruel
well to start off my review i must state that my knowledge of martial arts or even the films that influenced tarantino to make this film in the first place is extremely limited i managed to get a thrill out of vol 1 purely on a superficial level i always love revenge flicks and the stakes were definitely up with this one this movie can be summed up in one word intense uma thurman plays the bride whose name isnt revealed until part 2 in her best role ever lucy lui michael madsen vivica a fox and darryl hannah play her assassins  all led by the infamous bill played by david carradine  although you dont actually see bill until part 2 this installment focuses on the bride coming out of her coma and traveling to japan to convince the retired sword maker hattori hanzo to fashion an instrument for her to strike vengeance against those who did her wrong  and anyone who gets in her way the best part of this movie pits the bride against about 60 henchmen protecting oren ishii lucy lui and it is a thrill watching her slice and dice her way through the mob like i said before i may not fully understand every aspect of this movie but i still loved it and was entertained 100 is another example of quentin tarantinos cunning ability to take obscure material and bring it successfully to the mainstream and not only is this uma thurmans best movie yet its also tarantinos defining moment if you thought pulp fiction or reservoir dogs were great prepare to be blown away the ending is perfect and gets us ready to sink into part 2that really was a hattori hanzo sword1010,cruel
if you like me have a problem with one on one violence yet are quite happy to watch the wanton dismemberment of an entire squad of assassins then volume one is a film best seen as having two halvesthe first half features lots of unpleasant solo inflicted violence mostly by the bride  the second half is so blatantly over the top that you can suspend your disbelief and squeamishness and just enjoy it for the masterfully crafted piece of filmmaking that it isuma thurman is unfortunately not the best actress in the world  she seems too harsh too unlikeable to ever really fully deserve empathy  admittedly she may be a mindless killer but she just looks kind of weird at times thus the necessary special something is lackingtarantino is a vastly overhyped director but credit where its due by completely ignoring the linear storyline and bringing in the surprising cartoon sequence he shows himself to be a filmmaker of intense vision and bravadoit is the house of blue leaves that this entire film revolves around a wonderful demonstration of the ability to use types of shot shading and above all kickass fighting  one of the most impressive shots completed without an edit is the roving camera that drifts throughout the club and into the toilets  not even an action piece it shows just how innovative a director tarantino can be  even better that he follows it up with all the black and white and shadowplay that followsunfortunately without the house of blue leaves volume one wouldnt really be that special just another film about killers  lets be thankful that it is there and just enjoy itmy rating 8 out of 10,cruel
this movie had it all great action great characters and it was very visual and it was very violent but hay its quentin tarantino i always like the way in almost all his films he pays homage to the 70s and this film was no exception check out an certain outfit uma thurman wears this is quentin tarantinos homage to those 70s martial arts movies it starts a former pregnant hitwomanthe lovely uma thurman wants to settle down and get married but her wedding turns into a bloody shoot out by her former employer named billthe well spoken david carradine and his group of killersvivica a fox lucy lu michael madsen daryl hannah has four years pass and she awakens and will go on a quest making sure they will all suffer for what they did to her the best film ive seen in a while it also had witty dialoge the way taratino knows how to deliver it also tries not to be a simple revenge story it goes in depth of the characters drive make way for vol 2,cruel
quentin you are just super big to you thanks i think  it is the best movie from all which i saw also the best your film i was in a shock it would not be desirable to leave a cinema edited the script actors music shooting is just great such to shootin simply it is not possible but the most important fights on swords know i too fan bruce lee and martial arts movies but such i yet did not see at you in film the most truthful and severe fights it is magnificent you have surpassed everything even hongkong i with impatience wait the second part in my country it has not left yet but i am confident that it will be even better than the first whether also thanks you for that has honoured memory about bruce lees green hornet psby the way you in film have such karateman as michael jwhait and why there is no van dammeyour big fan,cruel
if you didnt like this film then you didnt understand what it was trying to do  its that simple  look at the film as a whole entity and you will begin to realize just how great a director quentin tarantino isi laughed when i read reviews that complained about the lack of plot  are you really that blind to the message qt was trying to convey  the director wanted to show that you can make a really entertaining film based on one very simple plot line revenge  nothing more nothing lessi laughed even harder when i read reviews that complained about the excessive violence in the film  qt purposely created a cartoonlike montage of images and characters that is so extremely violent that it becomes comical and entertaining  he even tried to point this out by placing a minicartoon in the middle of the movie but i guess a lot of you still ended up being cluelessthis is a great film  go see it  i cant wait to see v 2,cruel
though visually enchanting i fear i must join the army of those who complain that there is no movie here to speak of  what we have instead is a series of quotes and references that leave you astonished at the breadth of tarantinos body of trivia but with no sense that a movie of its own has taken place  the visual brilliance doesnt make up for the many weaknesses of the movie the characters are thinner than the anime and chopsocky movies he is saluting the nonlinearity of the plot eliminates any suspense about who will win what fight and 5678 drove me crazy  tarantino suggests a parallel between this and the indiana jones movies but accepting that only weakens the movie  there are no human relationships in this movie unlike even temple of doom  the sense of fun is more pervasive in the indy movies and the music  well id rather have seen an attempt to create ones own rather than borrowing from everything in sightperhaps volume 2 will make the thing hang together better but volume 1 is less organic than thats entertainment  i expected more than flash from the man who gave us reservoir dogs,cruel
vol1 is a truly exhilarating experience  very stylish and exciting stuff  however i did really struggle with some of its elements relating to children  as a parent i was extremely uncomfortable with qts treatment of some of the scenes  okay i may come across as a tedious liberal parent here  but i was a little squeamish over vernita greens daughter witnessing her mothers last breaths but what a way to set up god knows how many possible sequels  another roaring rampage of revenge  orphaned daughter vs mother  daughter vol 2 anyone  hell yeah  i was very disturbed by the anime section illustrating the genesis of oren ishii i suppose its what makes her who she is  all told i accept that these scenes are there for a reason  but it still doesnt change my gut reaction to themhowever with all the seatsquirming i still adored this film  qt doesnt go for his usual dialogriffing approach but the action well this goes up to 11,cruel
i wont talk about the plot cause too much has been said about it already spoiling you lots of fun i will just say what i think of the movie in generalwonderful moviea must see even for those who often avoid violent films takes violence to a poetic level turning it into a work of art that delights us both visually and mentally the movie es smart funny and very well and strangely told the characters and their violent interactions can be interpreted either as meaningful or meaningless depending on the perspective the pace gets slow at times and then too fast too suddenly like a rollercoasteryou slowly go up the hill anxious to speed down itand then you just one to do it againcant wait for volume ii,cruel
tarantinos is brilliant uma thurman is fabulous in the leading role as the bride thats got a huge sign on her forehead showing revenge shes after revenge armed with a sharp samurai sword she heads for her earlier colleges wanting only one thing to kill them allquentin tarantino has mixed up mexican spaghettiwesterns and japanese animekung fu movies and it works like nothing ever before made amazing action scenes genially made music tons of blood and chapters this movie kicks more ass than anything ive ever seen before while blood gets splattered all up the walls uma is wearing a tight and bloody cool yellow suit while she simply cant wait to cut bills head off but first shell have to kill a dozens of losers stars 55,cruel
everyone was talking about even before it was released those who saw it all said that it was very violent bloody and brutal i had 2 see it 2 believe it yes i agree its violent bloody and brutal but volume 1 has something i had never seen before amazing characters an interesting storyline cool fight scenes and i love the way they tribute old martial art films  say good bye to jackie chan and jet lihere comes the bride oh and this film are mainly for those teens that love samurai x or playing those king of fighters kinda games it really is kinda violent my mom and dad kinda hated it look at this film between the lines dont take it seriously enjoy the music and watch out for the amazing opening and ending u will either love or hate it,cruel
what on earth was all the hype about i thought reservoir dogs was good if a little overrated i consider pulp fiction to be one of the best movies ever made but this great start with real promise of an interesting movie then she gets the samurai sword and for me the movie starts to slide no plot twists interesting story directions or intriguing tales just one woman killing lots of people the dialogue is dull the camera work seems to last forever i do buy all the references to other movies but that is simply not enough to hold my attention this was just plain dull i found this very similar to the second matrix movie in that halfway through the major fight scene i was just totally bored the only plot driven element to the movie is how many different ways using different weapons and different gymnastic moves can you kill someone the first explosive fight scene was great but they just go on and on as a result i have no interest in seeing part two as we all know it will just be more of the same ill wait till it comes on tv wake me up when its over by the way im a huge bruce lee fan and loved the few decent movies that he made but just doesnt compare,cruel
spoilersis known as the top ten films in my list is nothing but a masterpiece the movie has wonderful music and the violence is so cool somewhat fake but still looks realistic the bloody scene with the house of blues is just another remembrance in the books of cinema how the bride chops off heads cuts of arms how she spins in the floor how she cut that guy in half how she cut off orens top head and see her brain how she beat up vernita green how she survived when gunned down by bill how she does all these things god how cool is thatone of my favorite scenes in the movie is the cartoon i absolutely love that scene is so cool and just intensive and just beautifully made my other favorite scene is the fight with gogo with that swinging metal thing it was absolutely crazy and very suspenseful i loved itthe movie has wonderful music that makes this movie a genius work and masterpiece by mr quentin tarantino critics loved it and definitely audience loved it this is definitely a movie worth watching and you wont be disappointed at all 4 out of 4 stars a classic,cruel
since all who liked tarantinos films before this one i think the expectations were pretty high its also a shame that the greedy company made it into two films instead of one just so that they could suck the money from poor students and movielovers around the world anyway the expectations were met and the film was great i think but in order to really grade it you really have to see both filmsso part one is good and part two well i think its even better but since its really just one film so,cruel
except for lucy lius freckles this was a pretty good film qt sets a sumptuous table with a yellow running suit the centerpiece the sound of it on the other hand was so annoying i think if the so called composer had been sitting in front of me in the theater id have kicked his chair which proves a point having an interest in something alone does not make for talent or even good taste im with you simon cowell the guy is a disaster that aside the music really wasnt the point gushers of blood was the point whoever wouldve thought there was so much internal pressure in a bad guy no slow seepage here it was as if someone had opened a fire hydrant quite refreshing whoosh this film is a huge spectacle now ill be interesting to meet the characters,cruel
snappy dialog great action goregalore great characters just an overall fun flick  anime cut scenes were well done showers of watery blood were not  even monty pythons black night bled more realistically but the cartoonish nature of the blood made the movie somewhat more palletableif it wasnt so absurdly unrealistic theyd probably have to hand out puke bags at the gate  uma was perfect lucy was deliciously wicked carradine was a great villain to hate even the former mermaid did a great job  vivica fox was hot  michael madsen was hateful in a good way  i cant think of anything wrong with the flick however do not watch this movie looking for some deep social commentary or moral redemption message,cruel
this movie is directly from the head of quentin tarantino his violent mind has unloaded to create a goofygory feature film about an unmerciful assasin on the run to hold her revenge over her lost daughter and groom as the brideuma thurman she holds her revenge with a swift mighty sword anyone who has seen quentin tarantinos other films will understand his madness and enjoy this film as always he incorporates some awful crude sex scandal excessive killing and foreign people who stand as racial benchmarks one thing completly absent from the movie is drugs in contrast to pulp fiction brings a person down yet overall the movie remains a classic to me and i cant even anticapate what will occur in the 2nd volume,cruel
i have to admit that i have never seen a quentin tarantino film and this is something i had to put right when i heard that was going to be released  a revenge movie with the acting talents of uma thurman lucy liu daryl hannah and in volume 2 david carradine and michael madsen  add to this a director with a very good reputation a martial arts expert of supreme caliber you are going to be on to a winnerthe film is the most fun i have had with a fight scene at the end that beats anything ever seen on film that includes the excellent fight scenes in the matrix movies  the acting throughout is superb and tarantinos direction is just brilliant  he makes the smallest of gestures by a character seem so effective  also the music is so moody and great to listen to in its own rightsome people have criticized this film but i cant guess why  it is only second last year to return of the king as the best filmi now cant wait to see volume 2 but more so hopefully volume 1  2 merged and uncut  maybe this cut of the film can out oust return of the king as my favorite film of all timeheres hoping and waiting with baited breath,cruel
after watching 1 i though of giving it a rating of 6 out of 10 here but after reading some user comments here i decided to give it 5 originally i wouldnt have made a comment about it but many things prompted me to i wont give a summary of the movie as that has been done plenty enough times hereanyhow i am not big against the film as my rating shows i find it quite an average movie and therefore i do not understand the comments often stated that either you love the movie or you hate it i am not a person sniffing at the high amount of violence within the movie i just dont the point in that the problem with it is that it all seems to cover for an extremely weak plot a woman seeking revenge and consequently kills each of the persons she wishes revenge for this is filled out with nonexiting combats and no matter how many thousands of people the woman fights at once she always wins so the movie is also predictablea thing i also dont understand is how high people praise that tarantino doesnt let the movie go chronically and claims this to be a sign that this is an highly intellectual movie apparently no one knows that this has been done before i do like the jumping back and forward in the history and the small little direction details but this alone cant a movie greati divide the movie into two parts the first i found was rather good this was the part until after the japanese anime part actually i think that the anime was the peak of the movie all that came after this was nothing special also i dont understand why the movie was seperated into two parts it seems just like an attempt to create more fuzz and interest about the movie people argue that the movie shouldnt continue after the massive battle in japan but as i dont see it as a peak but merely a way to fill out the 1 hour this argument doesnt work furthermore there was many things that didnt make sense and made the movie made up like when the bride wakes up of the coma she knows that it has been four years how on earth can she know that exactly four years passed when she just woke up of the coma and towards the end when sofie goes to the toilet why does she go via the stairs on her left which means she had to pass all the dancing people and walk far more than if she took the stairs on her right finally then tarantino doesnt make enough out of the bad guys and girls they seem like puppets and not real humans i know many other directors doesnt do that either but i had expected more from tarantinoregarding all the extaggerrated bloodshed then i did find it quite amusing but the predictability of the fights and the superhuman powers that bride apparently must have made the fighting scenes as ridiculous as the old fight movies it tried to ridiculatepulp fiction was a great movie this is mediocore all this said then i was dissapointed when it ended so soon and i will probably watch the sequel but i dont have high expectations,cruel
quinten tarantino pulls out another classic in modern film making with this superb story of revenge and payback of a bride left for dead by her former boss named billthe long wait for the next film to actually even challenge pulp fictions success is finally over with quinten tarantino has a movie which portrays the moods of spaghetti westerns and also japanese samurai uma thurman is perfect as the bride and may have also acted out one of her greatest performances of her careerwith one of the greatest showdown scenes in movie history and a beating soundtrack is an absolute entertaining action ride  810,cruel
its simply the best film ever to be madeuma thurman gave her best ever performance in this movie and quentin tarantino proofs once again what a master he isi hope to see a 3rd installment of this amazing movie but personally i hope tarantino decideds not to go for an animtated movie i would much prefer to see a proper moviei have yet to see volume 2 as it aint out in the uk only a few days to go but i find it hard to believe that it can pass volume 1 as i believe volume to truly be the best ever movie but i will wait and see,cruel
ive been looking forward to this movie for such a long time and it not only fulfilled my expectations but surpassed them  i was initially afraid that since im none too familiar with the martial arts flicks of the 70s i wouldnt be able to enjoy it  welli was wrong  theres even a japanese anime sequence that i loved  i am by no means a fan of anime yet i enjoyed the sequence  hell i enjoyed every minute  tarantino uses every trick in the book to keep his audience fascinated  first off he uses all the lovely trademarks from his past filmslong takes nonlinear narrative sharp dialogue etc  theres even some subtle touches that im sure tarantino fans like me will pick up on  for example theres a part where uma thurman says everythings square and goes on to do a gesture of the shape  she did the same thing in pulp fiction  also theres an advertisement for red apple cigarettes a madeup brand that popped up in his past movies  we even have michael parks as a sheriff  he played the same role in from dusk till dawn which tarantino wrotei cant say enough to compliment this movie  everything works  rarely do i give a movie a rating of 10  as i always say theres a lot of good movies but very few great movies  and i dont take the word great for granted  uma thurman is perfect in the lead role  ive never had a problem with her as an actress in the past  shes no beauty and isnt much to look at but i never remember showering her with praise for any of her performances  in she carries the whole movie on her own two shoulders and does it perfectly  the role required a lot more skills than simply being in great physical shape  i know she didnt receive an oscar nomination for this movie but hopefully shell at least be considered for volume 2  but as oscar politics go the academy tends to overlook actors in comedies and action movies  everyone else in the cast is terrific as well david carradine has a very commanding voice and that helps since hes never shown on screen  its nice to see that tarantino is not afraid to use actors who have talent but simply because of their faltering popularity theyre considered to be hasbeens  you know who else was considered a hasbeen  john travolta  and look where he is now all thanks to the great quentin tarantinothe cinematography is brilliant  theres all sorts of weird and unique camera angles that im guessing were inspired from the 70s martial arts flicks  tarantino even makes great use of blackandwhite footage  the effects are cheesy but they were meant to be and they added to the fun were supposed to laugh when we see characters heads sliced off and fake blood squirts out of obviously fake bodies  ill tell ya what id much rather see effects like that than cgi  the soundtrack alone is absolutely brilliant  tarantino loves to use great hits from the 70s and put them to good use  that was most evident in reservoir dogsas much of a tarantino fan i am i didnt think hed be able to make a better film than pulp fiction  once again i was wrong  i cant say that pf pales in comparison but even surpasses that movies brilliance  theres absolutely never a dull moment  not only are the action scenes spectacular but the story is fascinating  the action is by no means used as a crutch  we get to learn a lot about each of these characters  even though theres many fastpaced moments theres also many slower quieter moments  tarantino achieves a perfect balance in the films pacing  i will just give one warning before i conclude  this movie is incredibly violent  i know people have mentioned that before but they say that about all of tarantinos films  yet do we ever see the actual ear getting severed in reservoir dogs  no  do we ever see blood squirting out the mans head in pulp fiction  no  but this movie is jampacked with blood and gore  all i have to say is now i cant wait to see volume 2my score  10 out of 10,cruel
by watching vol1 after being able to speak youre going to saythrillingbloodygorymasterpiecetarantino has made clear once again that he is a geniusthe ultimate homage to 70s gory kung fu filmsshaw brothers martial art films and sergio leones unforgettable spaghetti westerns was filmed by the right persontarantino made the years we had to wait for his 4th film worth the waitfrom the first five minutes tarantinos delirium universe explodes and makes your veins pump to the brides explosion of furyshe starts taking her bloody revenge by killing all her former partners in a movie devotedto cinema itselfespecially the showdown at the house of blue leaves chapter is fantasticthe crazy 88s in a battle with the bride lose headslegs and arms in what seems to be the most hyperviolent scene ever filmed for a moviethe amount of bloodcutoff limbs and gore is so extreme that you cant help butlove itwhat is even better is that tarantino uses no special effectsas a result the blood gasps out with much more nasty funuma thurmantarantinos muse has probably done the best job in bruce lees yellow and black uniform since he diedi cant wait for vol2 and i have already bought both soundtracks and vol1 dvdmasterpiece,cruel
this is an incredible movie  smart witty sexy sharp and beautiful all at the same time  there are some gripes about this story not having a story which is totally not true  the plot revolves around the bride a superb uma thurman who was shot and left for dead during her wedding tracks her revenge on two of the five assassins vernita green vivica fox and oren ishii lucy liu who totally redeems herself for her two mindless charlies angels movies  i concede that so far it looks like a revenge movie however i havent seen volume 2 yet which develops the story even more and fleshes out its characters  ,cruel
this is one of the best movies ive seen i liked it im not going to bore you with this that nor the other just watch it and see if you like it from the comical interactions between the characters to the violent action scenes this movie rocks and doesnt stop kudos to quentin tarantino for making a great movie that we have to go see the second part now brilliantthe storys excellent the action is fantastic and the actorscharacters are to die for  hehe quentin tarantino has blended two things every growing boy likes beautiful sexy powerful women  swords the man is a genius and it only took him four movies to do it,cruel
you really can say this movie is violent nonsense stupid or a piece of crap but many different people has said the same i say greatthe revenge story about the bride and the stories of their exteam mates teach some lessons to filmmakers of these days scripts characters photography all in this movie was made with the intention to be great and contributes something to the whole moviego see it if you like japanese and other asian countries movies go see it if you like action series see it if you like anime as i do see it if youre already tarantino fan you probably already seen it if you like this new branch of directors going violent kitano ritchie aronofsky see it if you like 60s music and tv shows see it and youre gonna get a good old nostalgia candy i said it before i say it now great,cruel
i dont know what people are talking about when they say no plot i mean you have the motivation behind the entire premise which is uma getting vengeance over her attempted murder she has a list of her former partners and she goes on a journey of vengeance we even get a backstory for oren isii which is a great mix of anime styles the end is a great cliffhanger for vol 2 and im dying to know more about how this whole gang of assassins came togetheri hear that vol 2 is the drama to counteract this incredible bloodbath but there is a lot of drama in this volume uma thurmans character goes through a lot before she wakes up from her coma and seeks revengehow dare some of you say that this movie is bad and how dare you say that uma made a bad move in working with tarantino have you seen pulp fiction fantastic ive seen all of tarantinos movies and if were gonna talk about a bad movie id say that jakie brown was the stinker not love the music love the scenery love the story i rest my case,cruel
seems like most of the people that hate this movie are also the same people that have not watchedenjoyed the movies that got its inspiration fromive been reading a lot of the opinions on imdb and the complaints about excessive blood spurting anime scene etc sound like they are coming from people that dont normally watch old school kung fu movies samurai movies yakuza movies anime etcpulp fiction didnt require prior knowledge of scenes from other movies to be appreciatedbut on the other hand does require that prior knowledge of the movies that it is derived from and i dont mean just knowing of the existence of those older movies but actually watching the movies completely before you could truly appreciate and make a fair judgement of watching the movies that is derived from should be a prerequisite to watching ,cruel
hmmmmmmm unlike most people i didnt love this movie nor did i hate it however i did love certain parts of the movie and other parts i could have done without completelythe good the anime sequence completely awesome and disturbingly violent in a way that imho does not glorify violence at allthe action scenes sure theyre completely unrealistic but pretty stylized and definitely interesting to watchthe campiness cmon the pussy wagon is pretty darned funny after you get past its lack of political correctnessuma thurman super cool and about as believable as her character could have gottenthe style not all that original but it certainly had some flash and glitz to itthe bad practically everything elsethe dialogue was terrible even for a kungfu rip off moviethe plot plays out like a friggin video game did anyone else notice this i mean what other genre of entertainment has the protaganist slay 100 meaningless bad guys in order to get to the bossi had mixed feelings about this movie  definitely style over substance the style i give a 10  the substance i give a 3  overall once i realized that i could turn my brain off to watch this movie it was far more enjoyable,cruel
well its that time again when mr tarantino decides hes gonna reinvent some genres what is it this time kung fu flicksi have to confess at this point that my all time favourite film happens to be pulp fiction a movie that i personally can sit down and watch at almost any time unlike its follow up jackie brown which while still a great film took me several attempts to get through in one sitting so this film had to be good i had built up my expectation and excitement to a level which i myself would normally mock others for displaying so was i a fool for believing the hype hell nowhen qt made reservoir dogs he didnt make just a good heist movie he gave us the best heist movie of the decade in tarantino hasnt made just a good kung fu movie he has made the best kung fu movie i have ever seen 2003 was supposed to be hollywood had us believing the year of the matrix but they hadnt reckoned upon this little beauty coming along and quite frankly stealing its kung fu thunderwhich draws comparisons with 1999s original matrix movie doing the same with george lucas star wars franchise right from the short precredits opening sequence this film blasts your senses and refuses to let up until the final frame which although leaves you on a cliffhanger gives you enough of a movie not to be annoyed but excited and eager for the next installmentis a triumph of gutsy and confident film making and the most experimental work tarantino has produced yet  although the dialogue is sparce it also very sharp the action is superbly directed and beautifully shot never becoming dullcant wait for part two,cruel
this film is a treasure  quentin tarantino has a skill as a director that few have been lucky enough to acquire  he just like the coen brothers know exactly how to mix brutal action suspense drama anime and perhaps most important comedy in an excellent timeless classic hopefully while adding a message about humanity of course quentin tarantino cant make an excellent movie without an excellent cast  i have to admit ive seen more bad movies with thurman than good so i didnt think that she would be any good at all  same goes for vivica and lucy  matter of fact the only people i knew would be good were michael and david  boy was i wrong  there is not a single major character in the movie that i believe is flawed in any way  although some were stereotypical they still showed human aspects that we were not used to seeing in action movies  notice how some characters plead for their lives some embrace death because they deserve it some are almost sympathetic to their enemy  interesting this movie also has excellent cinematography topnotch editing and a score to die for  put in these five ingredients together and you not only get some memorable major scenes the enormous and overthetop swordfight in the restaurant but some minor ones as well daryl hannah whistling twisted nerve and goons comparing a waiter to charlie brown 1010,cruel
vol 1 is the best actioncomedyanime film i have ever seen since the dvd was released last week the first picture was incredible and the entire cast were on the spot  uma prettiest feet award winner thurmans character as the bride seeking revenge on bill played by famed kungfus david carradine was the most memorable ive seen on any motion picture  the visual effects graphic images including an anime of lucy lius character were incredible  mad props to quentin tarantino for putting bits and pieces to this film  ill look forward to see volume 2 and see where we last met our heroine  on my 1 to 10 scale i give volume 1 a perfect 10  im so very glad i gave this film the accolades it deserved  keep up your best work qt,cruel
saw this last night and had to watch it again the next day what can i say except way to go quentin the bride beautiful uma thurman on her wedding day gets beat up and shot by her fellow assassinsknown as the deadly viper assassination squaddivas lead by the wicked bill david carridine the guests including the groom are killed yet the bride survives and is in a coma for 4 years waking up she sets a plan in motion to seek out and kill those that tried to kill her the film is a tribute to the old school kung fu movies anime and even spaghetti westerns the brides name is not revealed until part 2 like tarentinos pulp fiction it is out of sequence jumping back and forth daryl hannahs elle driver although not in the film that much her best work will be in vol 2 is wicked the best parts include the brides battle with copperhead vivica a fox kicking some serious ass her fight with oren ishii cool as ice lucy liu and her gang at the house of blue leaves nice name and whats up with the guy that looks like charlie brown and orens originsnice anime none of the people involved in this revenge film are saints the bride is an assassin after all and you actually end up feeling a tiny bit sorry for the assassins especially foxs incredibly violent death in front of her daughter but thats what happens when you live this kind of lifeto get the full feel of the film watch it back to back with part 2 hopefully theyll put the film back together the way it was supposed to be,cruel
quentin tarantinos super charge revenge epic begin in this first half with a rip roaring introduction to the bride played by uma thurman who gets revenge on those who wronged her who includes vivica a fox lucy liu and david carradine who plays the enigmatic bill who is the tile of this movie tarantinos revenge flick is a great throw to the 70s exploitation films that has a great attitude and a great stride lots of blood bullets and swordplay to even satisfy the most harden of movie fanatics this is the first part of a twopart epic and if this part was a wild ride then i cant wait for the next half of this story to see what happens next cant wait for vol 2 and i hope its just as good as this one,cruel
was disappointed to find nothing other than bloody fights expected a lot from his one looking at the ratings but frankly speaking this movie is so shallow why is it on the top movies i dont understand k maybe they have some stunts but come on youve got to seriously give it a second thought to this one before you rate it so my advice would be see it once if you are curiouslike i was but its not worth a second nor a buy no offense to you the guys into this one just felt like letting out some lines,cruel
this movie simply rocks the only people who bashed it are the people who are thinking well this movie isnt like reservoir dogs or pulp fiction first off those movies were over a decade ago quentin shouldnt have to make all his movies the same  that would be like saying you hate raiders of the lost ark because it doesnt have the same feel to it that jaws does quentin has stepped away from his gangster movie image and gotten into the realm of action films of the 70s i pretty much love bruce lee and kung fu the series so this movie is a great addition to my movie collection  and about the action being over the top that was the intention this movie shouldnt be taken seriously in terms of its violence only the dialogue and story is really believable if you want to watch quentin tarantino make a gangster movie just watch pulp fiction but stop your whining this movie is great,cruel
the fighting scenes were extreme with blood gushing giving the viewer an exit from reality and an entrance to tarantinos twisted domain  this movie certainly expresses revenge driven by furious rage  in black mambas quest for revenge played by uma thurman we see a human terminator with one goal inevitably to  along the way she has to eliminate his protgs nonetheless her motivation and will to succeed and survive no matter what obstacles may stand in her way captivates the audience and validates her actions  overall this was an entertaining movie till the very end and leaves you wanting more  i await the sequel with a thirst for revenge,cruel
what a waste of great cinematography there must be a plot in volume 2please pulp fiction is the greatest film ever made i really wanted to like this is it possible that volume 2 will fill in the blanks and make this into a better film this is an amalgamation of many films in the past im not sure if this is a good thing or not pure genius comes from creation not duplicationbut it is very eclectic id like to know what qt could do if he tried to be more original there has to be more to this well on the bright side it is not the same old crap that keeps getting prefabricated by the hollywood mainstream i really dont have much else to say because ive kind of forgotten about it,cruel
volume 1 proves that quentin tarantino is back at his best with the latest of his films that sould be a killer hit with his catching quotes and great story and fight scenes he brings martial arts to a new level with top quality fight scenes that change from colour to black and white then to cartoon style fight scenes pure class and with a great cast such as the impressive uma thurman as the bride with revenge to find bill and you guessed it david carradine but first she must get past bills powerful gang such as lucy liu oren ishii vivica a foxvernita green daryl hannah elle driver michael madsen buddand many more also packs some great soundtracks to make u get into the film even moreso sould be a great hit with every one and is a must with all martial arts fans around the worldand sould also be a killer hit in dvd sales toobring on volume 2rated by me 910  martial arts must ,cruel
a bloody revenge film with great dialog excellent film technique and perfect pacing the film never has a chance to bog down and instead accelerates into funcharmingly evil antiheros do battle nothing really original about that but amazingly entertaining if pulp fiction inspired everyone with the ability to write some cheap dimestore dialog to put out a film riffing on unoriginal ideas then this movie is the ultimate jazz jam of grindhouse technique tarantino movies are more or less pitch perfect remixes of genres and you know what thats better than ok its a tune you can hum along with original in principal no entertaining yes the tons of unanswered questions are half the funif you like fast paced action skewed plotting stark images crafty editing and interesting exchanges between characters this film is for you deftly melting down a genre and forging an entertaining masterpiece a great film that will stand the test of time pretty good for a film that youve only seen half of 910oh yeah and dont forget selfplagiarism is style  alfred hitchcock,cruel
vol 1 was great  i must admit that the first half hour was hard to watch but once you realize that it isnt realistic and remember who directed it the humor emergesso much bloodso funnyuma was a trip  she does everything welltarantino was brilliantsome of the camera shots and all the music chosen was geniusim really looking forward to seeing vol 2i thank my 18 year old daughter for talking me into seeing it,cruel
i dont think theres much to tell about this movie its full of gore and violence but thats not the problem the problem is theres almost nothing else is what we can call the classic revenge story the bride was betrayed and her friends and family have been killed then she takes revenge using a katana instead of a gun of course fighting with a katana makes stylish fights but a movie needs more than that to be good uses original colors like a lot of yellow which we dont really see very often in movies thats a good style point finally i wasnt really convinced by the acting i thought it was okaygood points  the movie has a great style and is colorfulbad points  i was a bit disapointed by the script and the storyline lacks of originality and when i see someones arm being cut by a katana and all her blood spills out ruining the carpet with more than 30 liters of red liquid i expect this person to die or at least show some emotionsi still give a 710 because of its style,cruel
every once and while i hear a critic or filmgoer utter the words the movie just gets better and better with every viewing  really  what so magically transformed it into becoming a much better film  was the screen at the theatre too big for you and the movie played better on your 19inch television  maybe you have bladder problems and the dvd version allows you to pause for all bathroom breaks  or maybe you were too busy smooching with a blind date that you missed most of the good parts and had to watch the film several times over before you really knew what the whole thing was aboutwhichever way i have always raised an eyebrow when someone blurts out that phrase  that is until i caught myself doing the same thing this weekthe movie was vol 1 and i had seen it in the theatre upon its 2003 release  at that midnight showing i marveled at how quentin tarantino weaved yet another masterful story onto the big screen with humor violence and imagery so unforgettable that you left the multiplex salivating like a pavlovian dog after shock therapy  so when it came out on dvd of course i immediately ran to the front of the line for my copy  i knew that the wife wouldnt be interested so i waited for the proper moment put it in the player and sat back to be wowed once more  what i didnt expect was that my second experience was even better than the first and the third was better than the secondyou see tarantino films have always been like a multilayered onion there is so much going on at any given time that you could watch a film over and over and get something new out of it  take pulp fiction for example there were so many plot developments that jump from present to future in their timelines that second viewings allowed you to focus on a specific character or an event  vol 1 is no differentuma thurman is the bride codename black mamba  she was a member of the deadly viper assassination squad divas but on her wedding day she is brutally gunned down by the other members of the team and their leader bill  four years later she awakes from her coma and quickly sets out to avenge the massacre of her wedding party and unborn child  there are five names on the brides list oren ishii lucy lui vernita green vivica a fox elle driver darryl hannah budd michael madsen and the ringleader bill david carradine  one by one the bride intends to visit and extract revenge and unfortunately a two hour movie just isnt enough time for paybackfirst on the list is oren ishii not first in the movie however  the bride travels to japan where she attempts to use her newly crafted sword to engage ishii  all that stands in her way are countless bodyguards in kato masks with swords and chains  when she was done 57 people were on the floor bleeding profusely where limbs used to benext on the list was vernita green who is known by three separate names in the film  a homemaker who has since given up the life of the divas and settled down with her 4year old child the bride confronts her and again comes out victoriousthat just leaves three to go and volume 2 to extract revengetarantino seems to be having the time of his life with  he switches formats in a blink of an eye and has elongated scenes in black and white or animated violent cartoons  he spills life with gallons of blood being poured onto our screen just like in the martial arts movies of yesteryear  tarantinos sick sense of humor is also rampant and borderline out of control in vol 1  whether it was the pussy wagon that the bride drives around town or the intermission both her and vernita need to take from trying to kill each other once the school bus drops off her child i can visualize quentin behind the camera with a grin on his face like that of a five year old at christmas  even the first thing you read before the film begins death is a dish best served coldold klingon proverb sets the tonebut aside from all the violence and format changes there is so much to explore and enjoy in vol 1 that i dont know when i will be done watch it and adding to my praise  the third viewing i focused simply on the music tarantino has a real knack for soundtracks  stealers wheel anyone and was amazed at all the adrenaline flowing sound bytes he incorporated  even darryl hannahs whistling in the hospital had me tapping my finger on the arm restthe fourth viewing i focused on all the comparison references that tarantino made towards other films he has directed  vernita hates her code name mr pink in reservoir dogs the bride makes a hand gesture to represent square uma again in pulp fiction michael parks plays a sheriff as he did in the tarantino writ from dusk til dawn  a film lover could have a field day just amassing all the small details that tarantino has thrown our way without explanationif there was but one complaint about vol 1 is that it leaves us hanging like no film has done since star wars the empire strikes back  i yearn to a point of giving up my children for the second installment to becoming viewing available  and you may note that i didnt put at the top of my list for 2003 but give me three or four more showings and i would expect nothing less,cruel
spoiler well first off this is one of my favorite movies and i cant wait for vol2 opening this fridayanyways i have one question sorry if it was asked before but please answer yall if ya can  who actually killed orens dad not who killed his mom because that was boss matsamato the pedafile and is he still alive and a concern of mine is thiswhen the bride aka beatrix kiddo rolled up in the pussy wagon truck when she confronted vernita green does that mean that she stashed the truck when she was in okinawa and tokyo prior that whole time i mean why would she still have it or even keep it she bashed that male nurse a second time after he was dead for the pussy wagon keychain right cant she can just roll up in a bike like she did before the house of blue leaves fight why not a new car by the 2nd person on the list anyways this movie still kicks ass,cruel
volume one first of all this movie may as well have not been directed by the legendary quentin tarantino with slightly below par lines a brutal disturbing opening sequence and not much charecter development this does not signiture traditional tarantino at all it portrays quentin at his most angry complete with overthetop gore and violence which is generally fun but gets just disgusting every once in awhile sure it is a whole ton of fun but it is no where near being the filmmakers bestconsidering this i did enjoy the film however after a while the violence got a little overboard the dialouge terrible for the maker who wrote it and the movie had next to zero plot there were scenes i really enjoyed such as the anime sequence which ran slightly long the house of blue leaves fight oren and the head chop blood sprinkler and of course orens death but there was something that angered me tremendously about the film where was the writing it seems as if tarantino just through the script out the windownow i feel i must right a full paragraph just about the violence in this film it is absurd amusing and sometimes downright disturbing do you like monty python and the holy grail you know the black knight scene the whole film is kind of like that mixed with some brutal violence if that sounds like your cup of tea be sure to see this film i liked it a lot to an extent but certain scenes were just lacking oomphhowever so i dont go overboard on bad things about this film i did love everyones acting and the special and visual effects were brilliant i did laugh but just because of the complete absurdness of the violence rarely was i wowed by tarantinos wit like i was in pulp rarely was i shocked by what had just happened as i was in dogs this was just not traditional quentin and i hope he quickly goes back to his old ways and away from this grotesque disturbingly overthetop doanythingfor ashock faze it isnt near as fun 810favorite scenes see abovefavorite lines as your leader i encourage you from time to time and always in a respectful manner to question my logic if youre unconvinced that a particular plan of action ive decided is the wisest tell me so but allow me to convince you and i promise you right here and now no subject will ever be taboo except of course the subject that was just under discussion the price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or american heritage as a negative is  i collect your beep head just like this beep here now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say nows the beep timei need japanese steelleave your limbsthey belong to me nownote for all of the huge fans out there please dont flood my post with disses and invade with pms about how i have no right to be a tarantino fan i did deeply enjoy this film and i am still just as much a tarantino buff as i was before im just saying that the film doesnt live up to the directors predessors again i did enjoy the film and plan on seeing volume two,cruel
i saw this movie last year at the theater and at this point recommend the biggest screen experience possible  its sparse script borders on poetry allowing thrilling imagery to impact viewers to the max  all cast give strong performances but uma is most striking in her role as the bridal bruiser a convincing amazon yet showing tenderness as perhaps a woman best can most notably in her characters maternal grief over her child presumed dead  the films violence perfectly choreographed appears to draw upon a wealth of sources ranging from comic books to sam pekinpah  a sensory feast  looking forward with anticipation to two,cruel
 spoilers hereinwas simply breathtaking  tarantino is a true genius both in his writing and his directing  i believe that is his best film to date both because it is twoparted and therefore is the most complex and lengthy but also because it carries with it more substance and homage than any of his previous filmsuma thurman was awesome she plays the femme fatale as a hero instead of a villain which is refreshing  she embodies the rage and vengeance that the bride feels for her former accomplices and she does it looking hot at the same time tarantino once again brings his groundbreaking directing to the table his unorthodox use of sequence flashback and camera angle provide for a visual treat that one cant find in many other directors  it seems that the order in which he presents this film is at random but yet not at all eg the audience knows that the bride kills ishii but the how seems almost more important than the what all in all there are many flaws as there are in any film but it seems that a flaw for tarantino would be something welcomed by any other director in other words perhaps tarantino implants these flaws so that dumbass movie nerds will waste 10 minutes of their time posting something about it on a website  none the less is an innovative masterpiece worthy of praise from all,cruel
im not a huge tarantino fan but i do enjoy his movies i just dont worship pulp fiction like everyone else does anyways i got to see kill bil vol 1 at a free screening and i was very impressed i love old school kungfu cinema and this movie was a great throwback to the martial arts action movies of the 70s i have more respect for uma after seeing all the stuff that she had to go through for this movie the cinematography was great the action was cool and all the actorsdid a great job of pulling it off some people claim this as the goriest movie ever but they obviously havent seen peter jacksons deadalive great movie 810,cruel
every director has an epic  for david lean it was lawrence of arabia for steven speilberg it was the indiana jones trilogy  for peter jackson it was the lord of the rings  is tarantinos epicthe story of the bride uma thurman a former assassin gunned down by her old comrades at her wedding rehearsal and how she awakes from a coma four years later hungry for vengeance  her first targets are oren ishii lucy liu and vernita green vivica a fox the first now a japanese crime boss and the second an american housewife  the bride locates her prey meets them declares unfinished business and engages in a battleof course its not easy  vernita is a master with a knife and oren has a massive amount of bodyguards  what i like about this is that the story isnt told in chronological order  its unusual in a movie that the first target oren in the movie is more of a challenge than the second vernita but realistic the first target is not always easier but tarantino decides to tell the battle with vernita before the battle with orentarantinos script is also written well  its not as impressive or quotable as pulp fiction or reservoir dogs but its better than ninetynine percent of your usual hollywood writer  his direction is the feat here though  hes always talked about how much he loves action movies but hes never directed one up until now  here he proves he can direct an action movie better than your usual michael bay or george lucas  the camerawork is perfect and the camera tricks are clever  going in and out of black and white just showing the silhouettes of the characters fighting playing spaghetti western type music during the fight scenes all pieces of the puzzle of some great action sequencesif tarantino were edward d wood jr then sonny chiba would be his bela lugosi  its lovely seeing tarantino work with his idols pam grier david carradine and chiba certainly works here  chiba plays a sword maker who the bride goes to for help he is positively charming funny and cool in his scenes and you can just picture tarantino behind the camera shouting excellentof course its still only half the story  no major plot points occur the characters arent really developed and there are no plot twists until the very end  if youre looking for all that then chances are youll like volume 2 more but if youre the kind of person for great action with some dramatic elements youll love volume 1 810,cruel
tarantinos ego knows no bounds having it trumpeted as his fourth film is a huge turn off i dont remember spielberg or kubrick counting how many films they have madei assume the scorecard is  reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown a classic pulp a great work dogs and an ok film jackiewhat about from dusk to dawn i thought he was proud of that too until it was released and got ripped surely he has been in other projects too after he left the video storetarantino count academy nominations wins and i guess money dont keep score on how many films youve made,cruel
black mamba uma thurman wanted out in her assassination group headed by the leader bill  she decides to settle down and get married  however when she got in her friends did her out and put a bullet in her head and murdered the rest of her family  they left her for dead but she wasnt gone  for four years she stayed in a coma  when she awoke she made a promise of vengence and revenge this is a great movie  quentin tarantino brilliantly directs this saga with amazing shots and exciting sword filled action sequences  one turn off for many may be the violence  no im not kidding  this is jawdroppingly violent  the amount of fake blood used in this triples the amount of seawater at your average sea world marine park  limbs heads and lord knows what else are hacked off  this movie is not for the faint of heart yay for violencethis is a definite member of your dvd collection  if your unure rent it but chances are youll be satisfied,cruel
the problem with satire is often the more well done its made there will be more people who wont get iteverything here is over the top but thats the point  quentin knows what he is doing in this wonderful mixture of stylesjust like south park big and uncut attacked the concepts and social structure of profanity while not glorifying it by the way does the same to notions about violence in movieshaving anime in the film isnt just a device to tell background or because quentin is a fan  it admits that the rest of the film can be seen in the same context  the blood sprays from a newly headless body would require a hundred times more blood than the average person has the ability to take on and defeat a hundred villains is something only a superhero could accomplishthe film calls upon a viewer to think about how they view different genres of film what is true violence on film and what is of a cartoon nature and how far and just how dark a hero can be allowed to go,cruel
not my favorite of quentins work  the choice of uma thurman as the lead was good  she was excellent in pulp fiction  tarantino likes to reuse his actors and actresss one of the more compelling reasons to see his films with names like uma thurman and steve buscemi what reason could there be for not seeing a film  however buscemi does not appear in this particular filmquentin plays his favorite cards in this film mainly violence and a strange fascination for anime and japanese style martial arts  though i normally enjoy the violence in tarantinos films as it is usually paired with snappy dialogue and a witty plot this film lacks the latter two qualities  mrs thurman plays her character to her full potential the problem there is is the utter lack of substance a vengeful bride and some neat stunts is all she is alloted  the gross and seemingly unneccesary violence is the downfall of this film  it is a blood bath plain and simple  different from tarentinos other films he sees no need to justify or augment the violence in this filmthat being said i enjoyed the movie  i am rarely disturbed by violence in movies especially not the unrealistic kung fu scenes in these types of movies where people can come back from seemingly neardeath experiences and continue to fight each other with all manner of stunts and manuevers  in that sense the violence is almost playful in this film  it is fight scene after fight scene modeled directly after kung fu movies that tarantino loves so well  the special effects are up to par and the fights are well played but all in all this is a bloodbath of a film  uma vs the worldif you enjoy violence for violences sake then this is the film for you if you do not pass and perhaps skip the tarantino altogether,cruel
first of all this is my first review to start up reviewing every movie i see from now on hopefully ill stick to that statement lol                               anyways i finally saw vol 1 on dvd never been a fan of anime or action films but sometimes enjoy martial arts and sword fighting however this movie was wow so surprising an action movie with a great and interesting story thats rare lol the story rocks i was cheering for uma its nail biting edge of your seat action visually its unbelievable the blood gets a tad cheesy though and some scenes became overwhelming at times with so much commotion the house of blue leaves scene is amazing and uma is the bomb she deserved her golden globe nominationthe ending was jawdropping im just glad i only have to wait 2 days to find out lol a masterful achievement in cinema kudos to tarantino  my take on it  710,cruel
i dont like quentin tarantino or his movies  i think he is an egotistical obnoxious jerk and his films reflect his personality  vol l is no exception  a few of the action scenes are good and uma thurman is excellent as the bride but the movie just doesnt work  for one thing i saw no need to split in half  i think vol1 could have been cut by 15 minutes because of one pointless scene after another  do we need to know so much about lucy lius character  no and we dont care about her character  tarantino seems inspired by movies that only he has seen and rips off far superior bruce lee films  i think everybody should give quentin tarantino a  message that pulp fiction was ten years ago and his 15 minutes of fame are over with  skip vol2 and no vol 3 for us 510 and i am being generous,cruel
this movie is probably one of the best movies ive ever seen cutting this movie into two was a brilliant idea as seeing the whole thing at once would probably ruin the picture as their will be way too much action in it it would be a complete andrenaline overload and this would have affected the movie the action in the first part was awesome and very exciting to watch the scenes in between with the story getting set in motion was intersting to watch and very cool the story of lucy liu in the movie was very cool too but really violent this movie isnt as violent as people say it is even though people get chopped up from limb to limb its comically done so that it isnt realistic and just silly definitely buy this movie on dvd cuase it is a classic,cruel
i am a cinephile and i do think vol 1 is a fine movie  like the dreamers however i cant see why become such rabid fans when most of them clearly dont get the references  there is nothing wrong with not being an obsessed movie nerd like myself in fact its probably a healthier choice in most respects but some movies are made for people who have seen a number of films past the 3000 mark and this seems like one of them  but like the dreamers with its overwhelming sexuality its got edginess on its side tons and tons and tonsandtonsandtons of violenceevery shot character line theme and musical cue seems stolen from another movie  sometimes you can pinpoint the exact one sometimes you cant but it tends to keep you smiling and planning to tear into imdb when its over its overthetop not an epic by any means as some have described it and more importantly doesnt take itself seriously which would have been a tragic mistake  and certainly it is fun to watch again especially if you think its funny the way fragments of other movies are being subtly pieced together for comic valuebut plenty of people casually call this their favorite movie but i submit that by combining a bunch of fragments of movies for the sake of doing so one cannot produce a whole greater than the sum of its parts a worthy 710,cruel
to keep it short this film was not a great film but a self indulgent attempt at cool pulp fiction was a great film because its strengths over came its weaknesses you had characters you could be interested in that made up from some of the more flat elements some would say that contrast made them betterhere you have a series of scenes that are bloody in a monty python way i was waiting for some of the henchmen to say come back  its only a flesh wound in japanese and in general aimed to shock but without any kind of emotional set up they only end up being cartoon like and as the film tries to cut off the critics from this opinion we then have a cartoon sequence that is even more bloody and violentif you want violence that entertains go back to some of the films that this film apes but fails to fully understandi am hoping part two will add in some sense of meaningful plot which it promises to and maybe it should have been one film after all and heavily edited with some good dialogue put back inwhy this is in the top 100 on this site i do not understand if you think this is a great movie then its time to start trying some of the foreign language films at you local video storestew dean,cruel
i have read several reviews of vol1 that have questioned this films merit and i would like to take this opportunity to give us a brief pause for thought  why do we go to movies is it so we can see subtle social commentaries doubtful to watch an artist hone his craft  possible  to forget our own world of troubles and the stresses of our every day lives  definately  i promise anyone reading this that you will forget your problems if for just a moment watching  it isnt at the theatres so youll have to rent it april 13 but see the sequel at the movies  it is worth every bit of the 8 i paid and i only wish it had stayed in theatres longer i would have watched it again  i have only been to two movies where the audience applauded for several minutes during the closing credits and trilogy teusday lotr since i seen hundreds of movies that is saying something,cruel
what a great movie tarantino tops himself with his forth film uma is starring again and has quakelike frags every minute splatter at its best he also does his timething what means he tells the story in different parts again as brilliant as we know and love it from pulp fiction at last a film that is worth watching not that simple hollywood crap as it is coming up that days so awfully congratulations quentin unbelievable again,cruel
okay this movie kicks so much  it was so interesting how the movie used so many different types of film like animation and black and whiteetc also wasnt the first scene of the movie just so freakin amazing i was literally begging for morethat is how amazing that first scene was the fight scenes are really cool too sometimes i couldnt stand how grusome it was but none the less it still was so cool i just want to say that quarentin tarentino is the god of action flicks,cruel
yeah right like theyd let me say that i think that this is rightfully up in the top 250 movies ranked on this site one of the most artistically filmed pieces produced since memento mullholland dr of course all in my humble opinion not sure if i should go through the plot because there is enough of it on here but i wanted to point out certain things that appealed which support my vote for the 10 first im not an anime fan at all but i think the addition of the oren cartoon segment was genius and its a perfect example of why although not highly esteemed by all tarantino is undoubtedly talented with shots like the one of the sheriffs dashboard and all the glasses the scenessets themselves suburban house fight orens snowy and indoor scenes combined with such other tarantino unorthadox to almost a arrogantcomical levelthink of them as the new briefcase as in pulp fiction icons as the pussywagon and the deadly viperblah blah insert catchy group name heresquad that was sarcasm not their name but i still got a laugh from the real name you have to laugh at times as well as appreciate the creativity in every detail oh  yeah and one more thing how could i forget guys you have to agree with me on this one uma thurman is a complete babe in this hope you like it,cruel
 warning major spoilers included is a movie on which i had my eyes on for quit a long time the 5th film of quentin tarantino had a lot of high expectations to live up to and that had its good reasons to tarantinos previous films like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs were jewels they gave a new impuls to the heist genre and they inspired a lot of filmmakers would also be that renewing and brilliant or maybe tarantinos inspiration and ideas were all worked out and would only be the obligated next tarantino movie he had to make that would be a nothing more than a spot on his excellent reputationnow ive finally seen the movie and actually there is only one thing to say about it fcking brilliant i cant imagine that i thought for a second that tarantino didnt had it anymore and for that i most sincerely apoligize his movies just seem to get better and better what we see here is only the tip of the iceberg and this is just volume 1 i told you it only gets better and betterheres the story on the wedding of the main character the bride played by uma thurman everyone is killed by an assassination squad called the deadly viper assassination squad of who she was a member their boss a mysterious guy called bill puts a bullet in the head of the pregnant bride and that is that at least they thought that would be that the bride miraculously survives and after four years lying in a coma she awakes she then wants only one thing revenge she intends to kill all four members of the deadly viper assassination squad and when shes done with that shes going to the characteristic way tarantino presents to us reminds me of pulp fiction the story is not linear still every scene is essential to the plot and solves some of your questionsthat together with a smooth soundtrack as normal and the outstanding performance of all the actors makes another jewel of a tarantino movie the main questions however namely why do they wanted to kill the bride and who is bill  remain unsolved result your sitting on the tip of your chair for about two hours and youre actually disappointed when the movie is over the hunger to volume 2 only gets bigger and biggeri admit the story isnt that comprehensive or profound but then why should it it all goes about the stunning swordfights in confrontations between the bride and her enemies they are profound and comprehensive enough to complete the movie the heads and limbs are splashing into the screen like it is as normal as every eight oclock news extreme violence in his purest form you dont need complexity in a movie like this it is entertainment and by the way  the story is good actually very good because it contains action drama crime and thrills has it alldo not fear extreme violence though and if you dont like blood either do not watch this movie but if you do like it and if you see it like amusement and art like volume 1 would be your perfect match,cruel
vol 1 is in many ways groundbreaking experimental it may not be the best movie i have seen in my life but it is one of those that will be rememberred in 20 years for its poetic and unique style i admire tarantino for his courage to experiment with the art of movie making and how he always tries to be original and somehow always manages to succed even in a movie like this which has been build upon stealings from old movies and they are obvious at times but they are great and the sarcastic look he gives on violence its all fantastic he steps on grounds where not many others dare to step and always gets a unique resultthis movie has a lot of tarantino touches and honestly no one else than him could have made a good movie out of this storyline his use of sound is like before outstanding the soundtrack of the movie got a big part of the way he makes the blood and violence look poetic yet realistic in a waynow i must admit i think volume 2 will be better this movie spend a lot of time working the story up and i now understand why qt decided to do it in 2 parts else it would have been too long this way it actually works pretty wellnow you cant watch a movie without having to put your finger down somewhere and in this case i must say i think the movie wasnt as adrenaline driven as expected but then again i wouldnt directly say that is bad because i think the fighting scenes was well stopped i hate it when they overdo the fighting scenes and they become doll in the long run matrix revolutions this way he managed to end everything up pretty nicely although i saw zatoichi last week and the fighting sequences there was better done but thats not fault i guess they are unique in their own way one thing i found beautiful in and obscure way was the overdone wooooosh obviously inspired by crappy bmovies where these sounds are all over but they are so exagerated in this movie that you are gonna end up loving them a thing that only tarantino could have done convincingpraising tarantino all the time now for his genius i gotta comment on the acting too i think uma thurman is brilliant in this role it fits her fine this sporty cold and driven killer as for the others i dont think there is much to say i liked the bodyguard for lucy liu the little innocent teen girl with the big nose but other than that i think they were just pretty average uma thurman is the one that shines through if anybody the strong side of this movie is really the scenery sound and directing thats what i think910,cruel
i saw in its opening week here in the netherlands i was looking forward to a tarantino who i fondly remembered for the great films like pulp fiction reservoir dogs and for the fascinating story of natural born killershowever i also remember four rooms i also remember from dusk till dawn perhaps even jacky brown i will also remember the same way why you will ask when it has these great references to classics why when cinematography and imagery is so great why when it has so many different styles of filmingfor three reasons the first reason the great films taratino made had great plots in which he added depth witty conversation andor unexpected variations lacks all of these and good directing does not make good on thisthe second reason despite the fact that i am a movie fanatic tarantino referring to the movies which inspired him to make does not spell originality to me it annoyed me mostly for lack of it critics love it for this but people who never experienced or seen american movies from this period will see it just as an action flick with cool bloody scenesmia wallace from pulp fiction really appealed to me as a character and a presence the bride had no radiance whatsoever she couldnt scare an eight year oldthese are the reasons why does not appeal to me maybe tarantine is picking up his pace again after relatively a long time of silence maybe the next episode will have the quality which made the others great maybe the plot in 2 will twist like a snake on a hot plate or maybe he should have started doing these things in volume 1 so i would care if uma kills bill6 out of 10,cruel
this is a truly beautiful piece of cinematic history never before have i walked out of a movie with such a huge mix of emotions quentin tarantino is an artistic genius granted this is only his 4th mainstream directorial role but greater things are to come from this man the film is just the absolute best piece of entertainment that has graced the silver screen in the life of my movie going careerthe use of so many different styles that would normally appear out of context or even cheesy are somehow pulled off to create a universal heightened emotion superior to any other film i have experienced not only is tarantinos heady mix of film genres refreshing and experimental it is also well perfected and honedtarantino manages to create a sense of real that other films even his own lack you cant help but feel that you are a part of every breath that uma thurman takes every moment of weakness and every ounce of rage that she experiences you again are right there with herethis has been the hardest film i have had to describe to friends as it such a step forward for film yet without hesitation i would say it is the unparallel greatest film i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing if youre not fond of gruesomeness then it might be a little too much for the faint hearted to take the film can also be very raw in its emotion and the way that the sound plays a part in creating it and this again can almost be too much for some peopleif you see one movie this year then i implore you go see you will not be disappointed not only does it meet the requirements of any film to entertain the audience it also ticks the boxes of so many other criteria it really is a thinker even if the think you are thinking is malice aforethoughtall in all the best 2 hours ive had with my clothes on1010,cruel
the movie starts at a good point ends at a great point like other tarantino movies the story isnt told normally things dont have to be shown in the order they have occured but dont worry its not confusing great acting by uma thurman and lucy liu great music a lot of blood not recommended for kids the movie makes you feel what has happened to the bride makes you feel the need for revenge makes you feel like youre in the middle of the shooting or the errswording overall a great movie product of great acting added to great music story and directing i give it 9 our of 10,cruel
vol 1 is a fun movie if you dont mind blood and the occasional slow stretch its difficult to call it full of gore because the blood is so over the top it is not scary or disguisting but just funny trying to call vol 1 a real action movie would be like trying to call army of darkness a real horror moviei went to see this with a friend and we laughed through most of the movie so did most of the others except for a few people who went pale and ran out the doorit suffers from some issues with pacing and a backstory sequence done in an anime style is either brilliant or obnoxious depending on what you think of anime it probably could have done better with a bit of tighteningat present it is massively overrated in imdb if you got here by noticing it in the top 100 pass on it and look for another choice,cruel
i saw this movie some months ago with a friend of mine it was better than i expectedim not good to describe my criticism in english so ill tell you short what i liked in this movie  the soundtrack tarantino made it again first pulp fiction now great music very unique and entertaining it really woke up my emotions and gave at least two extra points for the whole movie  the whole story so funny and exciting to follow so interesting and unique again reminded a bit of pulp fiction though it was made totally different  the effects and camera this really made the movie excellent all the moves and all the camera views they were all perfect you could watch it over and over again just because of this  acting you could get to know the characters personality easily because of the good acting overall well it had a lot of violence but this is very different from the other violence hollywood movies this movie had violence with style violence as an art dont get me wrong im against violence in real life but this was somehow very entertaining to watch i usually dislike violence in movies but tarantino manage to make it entertaining maybe because of irony and maybe because he express the scenes in funny waysi gave this a 9 but i regretshould have given 10,cruel
is an anomaly in todays hollywood culture here is a movie that neither makes you think too hard nor tears at you heartstringsand it is a truly excellent flick under the shrewd and possibly insane hands of quentin tarantino details an ultrally brutal and even more emotionally statisfying quest for revengebeat to a bloody pulp and shot in the head and left for dead at her wedding day the bride uma thurman whose name is never revealed is carted away in a fouryearlong coma she wakes up and vows revenge and oh does thurman play revenge well it seems that the supporting cast lucy lui vivica a fox among others truly beat thurman to the edge of death her eyes convey her emotionthe limited and brief dialogue isnt even necessary she is surpremely convincing in every aspect of her performance even throughout the amazingly stylish fight sequences which put the matrix to shame she fights like a pro with samurai swords lethal daggers butcher knives and frying pansone of the main draws to this redefining adventure is the hilarious subject matter tarantino goes overboard blood flies about like fruit punch gushing out of wounds like a torrential downpour sometimes in fact you will even wonder if the human body has that much blood and in any other movie that gore would force you to leavebut here it doesnt why because tarantino never takes himself too seriously fight scenes are punctuated with effective and sometimes laughable dialogue but beneath the hokey action scenes and the cute quips there is a real movie at work here tarantino dances about the timeline bouncing the story back and forth to a dizzying point which forces your full attention on the gradually unfolding general story the cliffhanger ending merely seals the dealdeserves all of the accolades it gets although it may seem to be a hackfest on the surface there is true talent at work here uma thurman and lucy lui give inspiring performances the story however linear it may be it instantly grabbing and tarantinos masterful direction is as inspiringly as it is slightly distubring a true masterpiece one of the films to beat for 2003,cruel
vol1 is quentin tarantinos best work since pulp fiction and uma thurmans best work ever  its a classic revenge tale in which thurmans character seeks revenge on the crew of assassins who tried to kill her thurmans character simply known as the bride was a former member of the crew who attempted to kill her  after the bride is attacked she goes into a comma for a few years she wakes up and only has only one thing on her mindrevenge  is the perfect combination of action comedy and japanese anime  uma thurman is excellent as the bride  lucy liu is great as the half chinese half american o ren ishii  quentin tarantino does it again  the entire film was good from beginning to end  i cant wait for volume 2 to come out later on this year  vivica a fox is awesome and lethal as vernita green  however david carradine fans will be disappointed  he is only in a couple scenes throughout the entire film hopefully we will see more of him and michael madsen in volume 2,cruel
i have seen volume 1 both in its original form and the slightly tweeked japanese version for those who are not familiar with quentin tarantino movies they are violent and bloody but ultimatly entertaining although this movie is mostly japanese in idea with the anime section a good example of this this movie is so much more from great fight sequences some which rival the might of the last two chapters in the matrix trilogy to incredible acting this movie has it all the script itself is also an added achievement to quentin tarantinos filmography with a lot of popculture references and humour to stand along side previous classic works such as pulp fiction this is the reason why volume 1 is rated so highly its individualitly along with great dialogue and action make for an explosive and entertaining movie the idea to split this movie into two halves was not the greatest idea in the world it seems to be happening an awful lot lately does volume 1 stand alone just but when put together with the stunning conclusion volume 2 will undoubtbly bring then you cant help but believe that this will be another sucessful outing for quentin tarantino and for those of you who can i suggest you see the japanese version of the movie which has a slightly extended anime sequence and full colour in the battle between the bride and orens army no black and white,cruel
such crisp colors unusual and creative camera angles and modernsounding music and the killing and maiming and highpressure blood showers sure pass the time sorta but if youre looking for depth andor substance i recommend the simpsons or buffy the vampire slayer the story is like a comic book haters idea of comic booky the protagonist knows her former coworkers and nemeses so well she has to note their silly nicknames under their names in her kill lista hint in ten years when the color schemes and the music and the quirky imagery of this movie dont feel quite so modern anymore dont rent it itll age like a fine bottle of sevenup,cruel
so i finally saw tarantinos fourth movie uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu to be honest im kind of glad i didnt get the chance to see it in the cinema it was kind of a bummer watching it over at my friends house the first half or so is apart from the dry script more or less great brilliant cinematography great music and theres a true tarantinoish feel to it but the big fight in the end is overly silly and spoils the atmosphere filled with anticipation really cheesy blood effects that were perhaps intentionally cheesy get tiresome after the first dozen cut off limbs or so and the whole movie just seems to loose its edge and witt i definitely want to see the second volume just this time anticipation will be left at home a really nice nostalgic and cinematographic effort by the foot fetish director 710,cruel
quentin tarantino you know the name and you know the movies when some of the classic directors began to decline such as scorsese spielberg kubrick and coppola he arrived on the spot with a little film known as reservoir dogs while it was not a smash with the critics it was with the people making it a small hit and putting his name on the map then he did pulp fiction which has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time resurrected john travoltas career made big stars of uma thurman and samuel l jackson and scored tarantino various awards mainly an oscar win for best original screenplay then there was jackie brown which wasnt as hot but did become a cult hit and now after five years hes come back with the 1st half of a simple film a woman getting back at the person who stole four years from herfrom the very beginning of the film it is very obvious of tarantinos love of samurai and grindhouse films some of the best examples include the beginning featuring the shaw brothers and the feature presentation logos the usage of sonny chiba portraying hattori hanzo once more gordon liu as the head of the crazy 88 and make sure to look out for him as pai mei in vol 2 and chiaki kuriyama as go go the cute girl in the japanese schoolgirl outfit who could get a little mace crazy and the way whenever someone gets a limb severed the wound just sprays and sprays and spraysuma thurman what can i say about uma thurman she is the woman of the year sorry charlize theron you were great in monster and you have all those awards to prove it but you didnt have to spend three months learning about the art of combat or learn how to speak japanese the bride is a character you sympathize with even though her character was once a coldblooded assassin the performance has everything coldness humor tragedy and all those other things you love to see women do charlies angels eat your heart outand speaking of charlies angels who wouldve thought that lucy liu could actually act in something i love her in the charlies angels films but her character in those films is actually pretty onedimensional with oren ishii she really expands out of the good girl look and into a really bad girl look thats pretty mean with her samurai swordthe rest of the actors playing the deadly viper assassination squad are really good at their jobs as well vivica a fox does an really good job with her 20 minutes daryl hannah and michael madsen rule and i cant wait to see their characters develop some more in vol 2 and david carradine what can be said about david carradine yeah they never show bill in vol 1 or give bills motives for trying to off the bride but thats the greatest thing about bill and the bride its the mystery about these two characters and what they once shared that gets the story moving forward although i wonder if bill would still have been an interesting character if it was warren beatty or kevin costner playing the rolethe fight scenes in these films are something the matrix reloaded and revolutions wished they could be yet never could why because quentin put heart into the battle scenes here not a few million bucks worth of cgi the matrix fights failed in my opinion because it is very obvious to tell where it was the actors and where it was some cgi trick with the fights in especially the house of blue leaves battle it is always the actors themselves sometimes with a little help by traditional special effects that will shoot out blood like a water fountain and while i loved the house of blue leaves battle the best battle would have to be the battle between the bride and oren ishii and thats because of three things the beauty of the scene the excellent cinematographyediting and the perfect use of santa esmereldas dont let me be misunderstoodand speaking of the cinematography and editing i found it to be criminal that robert richardsons breathtaking cinematography and sally menkes award winning editing were not nominated for oscars this past year but it was a pretty big year last year and if vol 2 ends up getting nominated next year it would be kind of pointless for the same film to win the same awards twice in a rowi loved vol 1 but its just so hard to have it as the 1 best film of the year when its going up against the lord of the rings the return of the king theyre both completely different but also so completely entertainingwell heres hoping that vol 2 is just as great as vol 1 should be great to see how the battle between the bride and bill will play outa,cruel
from start to finish it is abundantly clear that this film was made by and for avid fans of 70s martial arts films  is an homage to the hong kong cinema of that era and as such it oozes with references to signature films of the genre  umas costume during the restaurant battle scene is a duplicate of that worn by bruce lee in game of death his final film  the swordmaker hattori hanzo is also the name of sonny chibas character in the shadow warriors series  as a result is best appreciated by those well schooled in kung fu films however that does not prevent those without such a background from enjoying the experiencethe movie is also very characteristic of tarantino  several of his screen signatures can be observed including some referenceappearance of feet the camera following a character for a long time without breaking and the infamous car trunk pov shot  in addition carries a 70s aesthetic similar to tarantinos earlier films  just as the others were inspired by the film noir gangster films and blackspoitation shows the filmmakers love for the martial arts genre  in addition the film renews my enthusiasm for tarantino by demonstrating that he can work in multiple genres  one can only wonder what else he might decide to do next i hear he likes westerns,cruel
i loved this movie  im a huge quentin tarentino fan and this film i thought was another awesome addition to the list  the cinematography is awesome and the feel of the story is gritty  the nonlinear story telling is also really cool and everytime you watch this movie you realize more and more of the story  the fight scenes are extremely violent but made to resemble an anime which there actually is about a 15 minute section of awesome anime in the middle  i like this movie a lot too because he is getting away from his traditional old school gangster films not always a good thing and trying a new genre and paying homage to others that have come before him  i cant wait for volume two  10 from me,cruel

if any other name had been attached to this movie it wouldnt have gone through because no one would let it tarantino has been awarded every freedom to indulge himself and dear god he uses every last onethe movie is drenched in style its loaded with very impressive cinematography and art direction and its well directed for what it was going for but i find the major disappointment to be with the writing particularly the dialogue the story was very good but almost all conversations between characters were just horrible the bride  vernitas conversation in the kitchen was just embarrassing to listen to their lines were so cliched that it must have been impossible to say them with any passion without hamming it up so they hammed it upthe blood spewing from every open wound was also a little overdone and just looked fake even without knowing the physical problems with it the blood didnt look good in almost every fight scene i mean if youre going to have that much blood in a single movie id take steps to see to it that the blood actually looks decentand then there were a lot of scenes or at least shots that were too long and pointless they added nothing to the film and if it was any other director wouldve been on the cutting room floor unless vol 2 is substantially different this movie did not have to be cut in twowhile its certainly worth seeing its not nearly tarantinos best nor is it worthy of all the praise its been getting there are way too many instances where useless content or ridiculousness was just shrugged off with well its tarantino,cruel

without exaggerating this is the best movie ive ever seen every scene second and frame is just perfectthis piece of film gave me a new perspective on the rest of the movies ive seen in my lifeif youre expecting a regular cinema film you will be disappointed this is not the regular movieexperience you knowthe music is amazing as well buy the soundtrack and you wont be disappointedive already watched this one three times and every time i find a new detail the director of this movie is genius,cruel
welcome back quentin tarantino after not making a movie for nearly 7 years he comes back with a violent delightful revenge flick i really cant say too much about this film because itd just be fanboy blabbering top notch work and i cant wait to see vol 2 9910,cruel
i was expecting alot from when i saw the teaser trailer for the first time  after watching it twice at the pictures  i decided that although it didnt have the story that pulp fiction has or the characters that jackie brown had  it does have the coolness i expectedthats what vol 1 is  a really great movie  i wasnt disapointed with it at all  do i think it was better then pulp  yes in almost everyway except for its story or lack of one  dont get me wrong  i love a good story  but the fact that has a very thin one doesnt make it bad at all  infact for an action film the story is perfect for itoveral i gave kb vol 1 1010  it was the best movie i saw in 2003 apart from rotk and i cant wait for the final part d,cruel
i think that this film was excellent it was one of the few films which you could enjoy at the beginning to the end well in cases like these there is polite to write like long comments but there isnt much to say because i think that everyone got it that despite the welldonemade violence it really was better than jackson sorry thats the truth and all the gorgeous casts and carathers and the music yes music with big m was like well it was altogether a very enjoyable experience i think that quetino is the next star in the business he isnt new but he is back so im a girl under 18 and i like found the movie superfine then what else is there to say,cruel
not tarantinos best work but still highly entertaining  this is an affectionate tribute to exploitation blaxploitation and asian genre films in general  i didnt find the whole revenge plot all that compelling but that may change with the 2nd part when more background is provided for the bride  not a lot of great dialogue this time around but some great action sequences make up for it  also includes a killer soundtrack,cruel
its bloody and its perfecti dont understand how people can give ratings under 8a film directed by tarantino cannot be that badthey must give this film at least 8 just for the superiority of the musicsdont let them vote heretell them to go and watch their goddamn romanticcomedy trash,cruel
this i think is the best kick ass martial arts sword film fighting ever tarantino did such an amazing job of turning  a movie just about revenge into such a cool film with awsome music fights and funny scenes  this is pretty gory but it was hilarious i dont know if it was intended that way but i was laughing so hard when i saw the house of blue leaves and it still kicked ass best kick ass movie with chicks in it,cruel
here we have it the best movie of the third millenium nothing was wrong in this one it goes immediately to the top 10 of all time movies uma thurman is the sexiestcoolest thing there is although lucy liu doesnt come far behind beautiful swords and exellent philosophy with them sonny chiba of course  darryl hannah is also pure fun she has one of the best characters in the movie history i really hope she will have more time on the screen in the vol 2 chiaki kuriyama had a perfect role as the vicious school girl tarantino really knows how to pick best things from the movie history and make it to a even grater movie it was fun1010,cruel
i honestly thought i wasnt going to like this film im not a particular action fan i cant stand kung fu movies and for me interesting angles and arty nonsense can usually not make up for the lack of a gripping story but i found myself absolutely mesmerized by this movie everything about it is just so unusual its like completely new type of movie experience the acting is superb the gore is done with humour and style and i found it strangely satisfying highly unusual for me and despite a ridiculous detachment from the real world nobody ever seemed to mind uma keeping a samurai sword in the seat beside her onboard the airplane  this did not lessen the sheer experience that it truly was to watch this movie 9 out of 10 from me,cruel
considering that it is a tarantino i had great hopes but was left disappointed ok it had some of his normal dialogue but even there we are used to better but the fight scenes why on earth did he have to make them so comical it has taken all of the impact out of it and it is not really funny if you slaughter someone do it properly ie more realistically and violently you can take an homage too far in my opinion the comic was just about okay although not exactly my favourite drawing styleafter this i will probably watch vol 2 just for completion but dont have great hopes for it,cruel
you know the feeling after seeing a quentin tarantino movie  that was hardcore  and is certainly that  a little departure for him this time around as the focus is on violence violence and more violence i missed the stories behind the characters like in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction but he pulls it off here  uma thurman was great one of the most intense roles any actor can take on  looking forward to volume 2,cruel
when i viewed this movie less then an hour ago i couldnt help to compare it with another great classic movie i am talking about once upon a time in the west not just the music but the theme of revenge the slow way the plot is being revealed it takes him more then one movie to reveal it all the crazed hero who kills whomever stand in its way the flashbacksthere are of course big differences between the movies but felt to me like a spaghetti western and i loved iti loved the music the fighting the abrupt changes in mood and speed of the movie the way he uses different filming techniques to tell the story the use of flashbacks to tell even the tiniest of details of the storythere are some flaws i personally didnt care much for the showers of blood the endless pumping of the red stuff was overdone and did not add much to the movie i also missed some scenes that just should have been there the training the getting into shape after so many years in coma and yes some more violence this movie is so full of gore and mayhem that cutting things like torture does not make much sense and i felt a censor recommending to cut these scenesso i give it a 9 out of 10 not a 10 mind you as it is not perfect but it is one of the best movies ive seen this year,cruel
i watched this movie in belfast by myself and i regret i didnt bring any friends to watch it with me its such a cool and entertaining movie uma thurmans performance was so good it would seem like her characters invincible but when she fights she still feels pain tiredness and um she pants after long fights too it made her character more realminor spoiler the cartoon chapter of lucy lius character is a real surprise but its very good the pace is fast the scenes and story is nicely edited it would be really stimulating if its not made in cartoon because of all the blood smearing and stomach cutting scenesanyway its a really cool movie i just hope vol 2 will be showed in malaysia,cruel
hi yallthis is my first review so please bear with mesome time ago i first heard about from some talk show conan obrain or jay leno i am not quite sure but as soon as i heard that it was a tarantinos i was dead sure i wanted to see it and plus it has the lovely uma thurman  however being very sensitive and not a fan of gory or violent movies  even though i am 22yo guy i had second thoughts of catching this movie  i know tarantinos style i loved pulp fiction and jackie brown but as i saw how almost everybody reacted to the gruesome fighting scenes i thought it was one of the sickest movies ever i fought with myself for a long time then decided with whattheheck mood to see it  and i was blown awaythe mastermind has done it againspoilers  if you havent seen the movie and would love to and dont want any part of it revealed to you please read no furtheri hate martial arts movies actually i have never finished watching a whole martial art movie in my life i always got bored and had to leave the theatre  but this one i knew it would be different  that artistic 70s vision of the movie was amazing  i enjoyed every little bit of it  the most thing i enjoyed was the introduction scene with the song playing bang bang my baby shot me down  that song was stuck in my mind for hoursokay what else about the movie  yeah  i got attached very easily to the characters especially to the bride  during the movie i was chanting kill them kill them all the fighting scenes according to a lot of people were very violent but not to me  i am very sensitive and the view of blood makes me sick but i guess i got used to violence and gore for all the horror and thriller movies i watched  and i was quite pissed when the screen turned into black and white during the crazy88 massacre scene for censorshipyeah when the name of the bride was bleeped i was really pissed  i never thought it was the making of tarantino i thought it was a profanity or some politicalrelated insensitive remark or something but then i researched on the net and read the movies script i realized it was done intentionally i guess the joke was on me and the final fight scene between oren ishii and the bride was breathtaking  i loved the character of oren and felt very sad when she died but was quite happy too for the bride and need i mention the last scene in the trunk  that got me hanging for the sequeli give this movie a perfect score 1010  it even deserves more,cruel
there is too much blood so its not suitable for all the guysand i dont like the cartoon in the filmalso should revenge takes so much lifeand also should to kill one to pacify ones heartlost of her daughter but may be actually be in the volume2,cruel
i doubt this will be the new hot genre not that it is new but id be overjoyed if it were this is one of the top martial arts movies i have seen it is full of the old school style and flare of the 70s kung fusamurai movies but has a touch of tarantino style that i love i recommend this movie to anyone who likes kung fusamurai movies dripping with class im a big fan of blood and guts and this movie didnt disappoint the only downfall i can think of is the anime in the middle of the movie but at least it was bloody,cruel
vol1 is a movie obsessed skillfully made overthetop stylish masterpiecei liked watching things happen in the world of quentin tarantino made his imagination come to life in this movie and you could almost sense the fun he had doing that the movie had his share of cool smooth talking criminal with great dialogs i mean bills do you find me sadistic speech actually the whole opening scene was a piece of art uma thurman did a great job playing the roll or the vengeful marshall art expert bride the fight sequences were breathtakingly awesome full of extreme and lets call it creative violence which shocks yet entertains you because its a necessity to the movies atmosphere and of course needless to say that the soundtrack was one of the best ive heardkeep in mind that vol1 is only half of the saga and its that goodi dont get the people who didnt like it but i guess everyone is entitled to hisher own opinion,cruel
quentins back after a long long time and he delivers the good this time the story is quite simpler so whats all the buzz the film is so directed shattered narration black and white sequences animation scenes this time is the action that plays the ball and not the dialogues and quentin did it again with an incredible soundtrack and astonishing performances by all the actors is a masterpiece that must be seen follow the bride to her roaring rampage,cruel
unique movie one of the best ive ever seen can hardly wait until vol2 comes if you havent seen it yet  what are you waiting for run,cruel
one of the best movies ive seen this year tarantino once more confirmed that hes one of the greatest directors in the world ive hardly wait for vol 2,cruel
this is a typical film of tarantinouma thurman is the best actress for the bride role and her performance is really goodthere are many fighting scenes in the film but the best fight was between uma thurman and gogo in my opinionthe fight scenes in the night club were really exaggeratedi found two mistakes in the filmfirstwhen uma thurman woke up after a long period of coma she looked at her palms and said four yearshow she can know thissecond some part of the fight in the night club was black and white in colour and the blood has a white colour in these scenesit should have a darker colour i thinki give 6 out of 10 for this film,cruel
people are writing that the movie is believableunbelievable coolnot cool retronot retro ie 1970s era trashy martial arts  likenot like qts other films  if i hadnt seen the film i wouldnt have a clue how to take it from these commentsbut i have and it is art  the characters are not realistic oren is completely mythological  but i love her the words these characters say do not reflect reality  the dialogue is almost like poetry real gangsters would not take the time to say delicate things like tricks are for  kidsthe music and the photography are lovely and extremely powerful  please see it as i recommend it strongly,cruel
its really amazing the way the music is attached to the scene like always in a qt film i guessbriefly it really is a quentin tarantino film just as it really is a hattori hanzo steel,cruel
drawing on his impressive knowledge of cinema tarrantino manages to breath life back into the pure action genereunfortunately the cut from a single feature of over three hours to two tv like episodes mismatches the pace of the dialogue heavy scenes with the adrenaline based dynamics of the action scenesonce both parts can seen as one movie i believe the clarity of the vision will be realised,cruel
yes he is talented now hes learning how to use the camera angles too the cartoon scenes here are good and almost the ones which is hardest to watch the turning from colors to black and white comes directly in the right second mr tarantino has rhythm but does he have the bluesmany critics have complained about the lack of clever dialogue almost none of them however dares for some reason complain about the violence anymore concerning the dialogue the critics are right there is humour to be find especially in the scene with the two japanese men in the okinawa bar yelling at each otherbut one has to ask doesnt mr tarantino get tired of himself he should make a comedy a clever comedy with clever comedians and nobody even getting a slap in he face that would surprise everybody including mr tarantino because there he could really give rebirth to something,cruel
as i reflect on all the movies of 2003 the only one that knocked me on my ass was  this one should be up for oscar contention but because unapologetically lacks the artsy finesse the academy drools over i doubt it will be nominated  but from the first scene where uma thurman gets shot point blank in the head to the last iwontspoilitforyou scene you will be intrigued  there are bits that are unrealistically bloody but tarrantino meant it  there are scenes like the fabulous knife fight between thurman and vivica fox that may seem heavyhanded but you can tell tarrantino meant that too  love him or hate him quentin tarrantino gives a damn about his audience and puts an extrordinary amount effort into every second of the film for you  tarrantino desires to make you emotionally react to his work  when you are shuddering and queasy during a grisly scene you realize that the last time you felt that way was an equally grisly scene in pulp fiction  like him or not he takes you where other directors dont or wont or most especially cant  tons tried to imitate the cool  retro  los angeles style of tarrantino most notably and ineffectively guy ritchie but they end up looking stupid like everything ritchies done  tarrantino gets it just right here  he creates a movie that you dont just happen to see it happens to you,cruel
vol 1 is the start of yet another genius tarantino when i went to see this movie i knew nothing about it bc i had seen no previews i knew it was a quentin tarantino film and thats about it go and see it you will not be disappointed,cruel
i could easily put that one among the other cult movies because i saw real action in it unfortunately nowadays its too common and easy to make an action movie by the means of money of course exploding cars flying people silly runcatch parts showing no originality at all but that one absolutely beats them actually i think this movie should even be put into another category tarantino knows the way he made it before he made it again thats it,cruel
i have to admit i was rather dissapointed with jackie brown but after six years of waiting i must say is awesometarantino has finally made his ultimate dream film  gore  samurais and chicks kicking ass  meaning if you hate tarantino you will hate thisfantastic all the way and uma is brilliant1010,cruel
i dont know how he did it but all i can say q is a geniusof course with his signature startthemovieatthemiddle till the fight scene at the bar he did another amazing work he combined his 60s70s influences in tv japanese animation and live action kick butt action sequences to make another masterful work since pulp fiction could have been reservoir dogs but i havent watched it yetas for uma thurman what else can you say she kicks major ass in this movie than in any other film if she did her own stunts id give her a pat on the back she is the perfect fit for this role she can be the equivalent of tom cruise in the last samurai ok maybe not but still she rockscant wait for volume 2 if volume 1 was bloody wait till the bride slices and dices her next foes,cruel
is a great movie without doubt one of the movies with best fighting scenes ever i think it was a bit too violent however a little less of blood would have been better imho now the only think we can do is wait anxiously for the sequel or sequels 810,cruel
i have never seen something like this i dont know what made me laugh de overexagurated killings and bloodspilling or just how awfull this movie is there was even a 15 minutes cartoon in it which i found very amusing overall a good movie thanks to quentin tarantino 8 out of 10,cruel

this movie is a perfect example of how a movie can deliver exactly what was promised  though many reviews complain about the fact that the movie was split into two volumes i think it was actually a good idea  sitting through 4 hours of unmitigated violence would have been overwhelminginstead this movie is an hommage to classic movie styles and classic movie productions  sonny chiba even has a role  this is not a movie that is supposed to be epic this is a movie that is supposed to entertain you in a well educated manner that reflects the influences on the directors careerwhereas pulp fiction presented the essence of cool presents the summary of the entire action genre  never in one movie have we seen so many styles so many fights so much intensity in such a beautiful and easy fun to watch packagehats off to quentin  i know that the eventual dvd release with both volumes 1 and 2 together will be one of the most important dvds for any movie lover to own,cruel
i never saw a movie such as this where it was exciting and funny and crazy all at the same time and yet the huge audience was quietwe were all in awe of such a wellmade film,cruel
the film has so much violent scenes which are not necessary to express the idea of the director and the plot is not very interesting or logical at least in my eyes what is worse is the length of it seeming to have vol2 so i give 7 to it,cruel
little green bag stuck in the middle with you reservoir dogs son of a preacher man girl youll be a woman soon pulp fiction these songs changed their meaning for me while watching qts movies he has always been a master in combining sound with images that part of his talent plays a big role in as wellno funny dialogue like in his first two movies this time images and soundtrack do their work after watching it the first time i left the theatre overwhelmed the second time i was enjoying the movie even more because you can now focus on the craftmanship and tiny details that make it specialthis movie is bloody as hell so not for everyone but you shouldnt be put off by this prospect its a masterpiece and is now my 2nd favorite qt movie after pulp fictionbang bang he shot me down will never sound the same to me again,cruel
if youve seen films like gauyat sandiu haplui saviour of the soul 1992 gonin 1995 monty python and the holy grail 1975 zhan shen chuan shuo moon warriors 1993 and mix this with quentins to me best film reservoir dogs 1992 then you still only have half of what to expect from this first volume of with reservoir dogs tarantino proved that there is possible to create a better version of a movie he reworked long hu feng yun city on fire from 1987 with he proves to the world that he actually can get inspired from a wide source of media and create something new and originalwhere ying xiong hero 2002 and wo hu cang long crouching tiger hidden dragon 2000 found a wider western audience than most other asian films these two movies are pathetic in comparison to what came out of hong kong china and japan during the 90s but these two are also by far boring if seen together with but why compare anyway stands on its own and there is probably no other film like it it has violent scenes that have a humour not seen since robocop 1987 and it also has really neat performances from severel actresses and actors i didnt even believe were still alivei never liked uma thurman or pulp fiction 1994 but after watching volume 1 i can say that i wont say a bad word about uma ever again she is perfectas can be said by most people in this high quality sword slashing flickhas only one thing wrong its divided into two films volume one and volume two i hate that i wanted to see these two films together but now i have to wait that is not nice of miramax but hey they probably want us to double their money right i cant see any other reasonvol 1 is a perfect 10 quentin tarantino must be proud i havent seen him make a good film since 1992 so im happy i think tarantino got vol 1 to look exactly as his visionnow i just hope that vol 2 is equally good10 out of 10,cruel
i consider myself an objective movie reviewer just because tarantino directed this movie doesnt mean ill try to like it i have no loyalty whatsoever to any studio or director it is human nature to look up to mythic characters like tarantino and tolkien how else did hitler come to power this perhaps explains the fanaticism of tarantino and lotr fans it also explains why tarantinos films as well as the lotr films have such inflated imdb ratingsis a good movie the music and visual elements are unique and idiosyncratic especially during the first half of the movie tarantino builds up great suspense with the nurse walking to the bride in hospital and almost killing her the splitscreens brightcool colors and anime scenes were stylish and entertaininghowever halfway through the movie tarantino seemed to have gotten lazy the fight scene in which the bride goes up against hundreds of men with swords is excessively cut a continuous shot like that found in most fight scene in the matrix would have been preferable this would have created a greater sense of cohesion instead the fight scene in is quite confusingafter watching volume 2 ill be able to talk about the plot and characterization in the first volume characterization is quite disappointing but i can expect that in martial arts films the matrix had poor characterization as well every character spoke like philosophy professorslike crouching tiger hidden dragon main protagonists are females which is quite alright as it works well as a feminist message to viewers gender roles are often reinforced by sexist movies like lord of the rings710,cruel
the reviews on imdb were very encouraging it is also true to say that a lot of the reviewers consider tarantino to be more important than the good lord himselfthis is not a great movie the movie reminds me of the weather in england if you dont like it at the moment wait for 5 minutes and it will have changed you never know what youre going to get from scene to scene the problem with tarantino is that nobody is having any editorial input into his movies and they are a little indulgenthaving said that overall the movie is good and would have been very good if it hadnt have been split into two parts to take more money from us punters,cruel
i have to agree with every complaint regarding this film there is so much violence the story is so simple qt is evidently strongly inspired from many old movies and so on  yet few days ago i saw it in a cinema for the second time and  i loved it again how to explain it  my strongest feeling is that qt completely enjoyed every moment of making this retro movie and somehow his joy emanates from the movie at least for most of us few possible lesser spoilers follows one thing i considered great are characters go go looks so sadistically evil in her seventeen that everybody must run away just guessing her coming trust me freddy krueger was just a funny old neighbor oren ishii is wonderfully mythical japanese geisha ninja at least until her chinese  american taint shows  hattori hanzo and his two faces  funny shopkeeper  noble samurai swordmaker are just flawless and there are others excellent as wellanother great part are scenes a beautiful japanese winter garden is probably the best but there are many others  bluered pool yakuza brainstorming hattori hanzo katanas anime scene etclast but not the least the humor just the right amount of it and usually on right places a little girl entering the house  everything is broken and crushed shards and blood everywhere her mother and stranger women all in blood with their hands hiding knives behind back what has happened mommy  well you see sweetheart it was your little nasty dogie few interesting pointers leads to part ii probably protagonist name is not mentioned at all actually in one scene is even censored  beep method  only a code name in the part when uma leaves the japan by airplane you can spot a second katana in the plane but not its owner  and the end point of this part 1 is good too luckilyshortly if you can understand that the film doesnt try to be serious and if you do not mind to accept that violence may be so funny to watch strange though may it be you may love the film as i do  and still you may ask yourself how is it possible i like such things frankly i do not know the answer for myselfi give 910,cruel
i loved this beautiful movie although i find it very short of substance i believe tarantino made of his childhood dreams playground a stage for this movies events i do not know what to deduce from this what does it exactly say about his childhood i am sure some people may think they there are ready recipes to understand and explain the movie and the possible dreams beyond it but i think it is not any important the beauty in this movie and the level of perfection in conveying what the director and the crew wanted to say is just beyond my words thank you so much to everybody in the movie,cruel
ok it looks great that much is true but otherwise i dont know i admit ive never been much of a fan of tarantinos work and this one isnt exception maybe i just dont have right kind of sense of humor oh the animated part was also great but after all its just empty film with nice wrappings,cruel
with jackie brown it seemed as if tarantino kind of lost his edge though where its fair to say jackie brown wasnt tarantinos best movie it wasnt all bad and there were still some trademark tarantino moments now he waited for the right moment to do these filmsvolume iii and my god is it good its in no way the same as his former movies and its in no way the same as all the other movies in where theres martial arts lets face it theres a hype going on since the first matrix how easy it was in 1999 to create some intresting and original martial arts attacks how hard is it to do the same today but with tarantino did it beautyfully just by not creating an overkill and not only with the fight scenes tarantino creates originality also the way he portrayed it is done perfectly with a huge amount of blood you can do so much he might of thought well hes correct plus the movie is funny as hell just the way we like it from tarantino in where i was kinda sceptic about tarantino behind the camaras in a martial arts film he overdid himself and i cant wait for the next oneand one more thing even in japanese this guys funny ,cruel
i loved this movie excellent fight scenes very cool dialogue i can tell you with no ego that this is my finest blade if on your journey you should encounter god god will be cut  great stuff and uma thurman looking sexier than hell9 out of 10 would get 10 except that its really only half a movie,cruel
this film is brilliant its a bonafide vision from beginning to cliffhangeras others have pointed out i think this film was created with animestyle in mind i havent seen much anime but many of the visuals in this film remind me of stuff like mononoke hime and rurouni kenshin the latter example tells me to interpret as a brilliantly executed episode a twoparter rather than a filmpeople have complained of the lack of story i perceive the same fact this way tarantino is working with a cookiecutter cliche of a revenge flick so it defies any attempt at exciting description the movie tacitly assumes that a story so basic should automatically resonate with anyone so now the entertainment is derived from seeing how the film executes the story a movie movie i think tarantino has created this film with more enthusiasm and panache than you would normally see in mainstream stuffthe semiformal dialogue in this film also reminded me of old samurai stuff where stronglyabided codes of honor and respect and warriers and swords as well as swordsmiths of different orders of strength are the dictates of the land so i think it is appropriate that the dialogue is restrained compared with pulp fiction really i dont see how pulp fiction has anything to do with this film other than the fact that the director made both with his particular kitchensink style folks he was going for something different from his previous efforts actually i take it back pulp fiction foreshadowed this film when butch rescues marcellus wallace from a fate worse than death with a samurai sword and subsequently wallace who was a moment ago hellbent on scouring the earth for the motherfcker butch without hesitation follows an unspoken code of conduct and dissolves their feudokay naysayers you gotta admit at least that tarantino has a sense of showmanship that alone sadly still puts above average in the mundania also known as hollywood,cruel
i cant remember the time i was so thoroughly entertained by a movie is a very violent and gory trip and it doesnt pull any punches its one of the best movies ever made you can watch the first ten minutes and you wont be able to get up until its over    tarantino puts a kung fu samurai and spaghetti western movie all in one it borrows from the samurai movies that 60s and 70s spaghetti westerns were based on i was taken aback when i actually heard some spaghetti western music in the movie the movie is pretty funny as well tarantino has a unique sense of humor and most movie lovers go introduced to in pulp fiction this movie has the same sense of humor he pays a lot of homage to kung fu movies the brides costume as she takes on an army of henchmen is the same one bruce lee wore in game of death its little touches like this that will make a must see for any kung fu movie fan i cant wait for part tworayvyn,cruel
i read some of the reviews on this board and the main complaint was that there is no story or plot i have to say that is true but tarentino has made his movie in a way i didnt care about the story every single scene was just perfect the music goes so well with the movie that the dialogue was not necesary for me,cruel
i dont know about generally overrated but when some qt nuts claim its the movie of the century the old and the new one i think they definetly are overrating it and its importance to the future of filmmakingi personally understand qts intentions with the visual style of kb v1 but however hard he tries to give it that good ol bactionmartialartsfrombackthen he cannot make me forget that this is infact a multi million  movie its a bigbudget lowbudget wannabe why didnt he simply make it low budget to begin withstorywise kbv1 is an orgy of wornout chlichs which might also be the intentionin fact the story seems simply to be an excuse for qt to show off some skills in capturing visual styles the characters are highschoolscript flat and 1st gradehomemadecomic stereotype heck ive seen kids who play with lego present more interesting charactersconclusively i would like to cite a good friend of mine just because its intentionally bad does not make it goodscore 68 ,cruel
who ever said a movie needs a story in this day of computer effects cgi and all that bullcrap which can be nice if used with a purpose and for the right things but hollywood has over used this method of creating unreal shots to spice up action scenes enter i didnt notice any computer effects in this one the impact the action scenes had on me and believe me they had quite an impact came from the great choreography of yuen wooping the physical abilities of the stunt men and women involved and obviously from the incredible sense of style the great quentin tarantino possesses i guess a lot of people will call this movie tasteless and dumb action and so forth its probably guilty as charged but you cant deny the artistic abilities of the director and the poetry in motion that this movie definately is i gave it a 9 due to the lack of story but its still the best movie of the year note i havent seen the return of the king yet this american production has the same level of martial arts style and stays true to the genre like crouching tiger hidden dragon and hero to make one of the best kung fu movies ever i cant wait till vol 2,cruel
i remember i was hooked when ive seen reservoir dogs the first time pf after that was getting close i was really disapointed watching jacky brown but with qt is back to business for me great pictures with great sound and a strange but nice plot only drawback is that quentin split this one into two movies i smell the  but hopefully we get 2 soundtracks  sorry for bad english,cruel
tarantino has taken a sixyear break from filmmaking leaving all his fans awaiting his next project being a very big fan of both reservoir dogs and definately pulp fiction i was exceedingly excited to see this film it did not let me downtarantino obviously indulgences in his likeness of japaneese action and bloody gore but we expect that from him as tarantino is an admitted film geek it would be almost sinful to him not to make references to his favorite films such as umas outfit thats identical to bruce lees outfit in game of deathi must remark to tarantinos beautiful direction exploring in new camera tricks and japaneese cartoons probably quentins finest directorial performance yet as a screenwriter quentin was going places he has no business being hed been made famous with gangsters talking about royale w cheese and madonna he seems to want to leave that behind but doesnt realise that this is another expectation from of his fansmost definitely not his greatest film but it is worth watching to see tarantino experiment with japaneese folklore and a superb performance by thurman its a megablast of pulp8510,cruel
i absolutely loved this flick it has martial arts revenge swords uma thurman everything a boy could hope for in a movie industry overrun by special effects its nice to see guys of tarantinos caliber putting the old school movie making to good use if you liked tarantinos earlier stuff and who didnt give this one a peek you will not be displeased i said wow during the film and i dont do that much,cruel
it feels tarantino had more fun making this movie than the audience had when i watched it i was very surprised at the high imdb rating maybe american voters liked it better ok so he likes godard that doesnt make it a good film while godard had the substance and style this is an orgy of style only it is sometimes impressive and all through funnily twisted but its just too much style compared to the substance the scenes are not perfected with style rather the scenes exist just in order to carry the style also one could argue if it really is cool i dont think it is a blonde girl with a samurai sword and a yellow motorcycle suite might be comically but certainly not cool to me it is professional done with attention to details and the music is great do i have to say that its extremely violent as well11  20,cruel
what can i say quentin did it again and only the soundtrack makes the movie a 10 zamfir  the lonely shepherd is one of the most balanced and great song ive heard in a very long time and the mix between the old samuraistyle and modern moviestyle is just great,cruel
i really like this movie because of the acting mostly and the action sequences the end of the movie particulary the last line really got me my friend and i were just stunned and have been waiting for the next volume to come out uma thurman has given her best acting job yet and she is pretty hot too my favorite movie of the 2003 is definetly volume along with matrix revolutions and return of the king you have to see it,cruel
i didnt think this would be a good movie i were so wrong as you can be its beautiful its thrilling and the time just ran away when you see this film but then there are those who hated this movie like my friend i think this is a movie you hate or love i love it what you do i can not tell,cruel
so many people are saying that they hate this quentin tarantino movie because it is not a quentin tarantino moviefans of his other films are used to seeing mainly lots of shooting and lots of fbombs and now people are disappointed and outraged that his 4th film doesnt have that why people are putting him down because he has gone in a different direction and feel he has abandoned his styleto those people i say go to hell yeah it must really suck for quentin tarantino that he decided to go in a different direction and try something he has never done before and actually succeed in every way critics love it the people love it and most importantly i love itmy rating 1010ps tarantino was screwed out a best director oscar for pulp fiction hopefully at the next ceremony the academy will wake up and realize that this man is brilliant,cruel
spoliersthe first word that pops into your mind when you hear the name quentin tarantino is shockingwhy because i grew up watching films like reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown when i first heard about this film i really didnt get to jeeped up because when i heared about the film getting slip i thought of what a pain it would be to go to the movies twice just to see what happenesi was dead wrong is about the bride uma thurman who gets attacked on her wedding day from her boss bill david carradine and her coworkers the deady viper assassin squad lucy liu  daryl hannah vivica a fox and michael madsen after getting a bullet in the head she wakes up four years later and seeks revenge on them quentin out did himself once againa film i thought i would hate ended up being one of the best of 2003also reuseing uma and madsen was very smart the film is great and action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seatalso now i think great idea to split the films in half great cliffhanger im counting down the days now untill vol2 which i hope out grosses vol1 also as budd said that woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die,cruel
now dont get me wrong i am not the greatest qt fan around  i simply hate reservoir dogs overrated and pulp fiction was fun but is not  for repeated viewing not to mention the dire jackie brown but i simply adore this movie  maybe it is as simple as finally movie about a girl who whoops everyones ass althoughi believe it has more to do with the layer upon layer of different influences music choice fighting scenes that put the matrix to shame and darn seemingly effortless cool that is rarely attained in movies but frequently strived after  i have to concede that story even though told in a novel fashion is not the thing that got most attention but then again the premise of a woman out on righteous revenge is an avenue which has not been explored too often it has a freshness about it that neutralises any thinness of plot  in fact it would get in the way of the whole picture in my view  we get that she is pssed and we get that she is right to pursue the people who betrayed her  what more do we need to know than what qt so meticulously tries to unfold that is the paradox in this movie  the story is told in a slow pace that belies the action packed scenes no boredom here  just total awe at the greatness of it all   i envy the talent i think every moviemaker in hollywood is right about now and might do their utmost to prevent this movie to get the credit it deserves  lets hope that integrity will rule over egos this year,cruel
as we now all know the fourth movie by quentin tarantino is an overthetop action spectacle that unfortunately doesnt really hit the mark its a decent attempt but by no means a classic like reservoir dogs and pulp fiction is undeniably still a tarantino movie the absurd characters the absurd situations they get into the pointless but very cool dialogs the deliberately corny music once again chosen brilliantly and all the things that made his other movies so great are still there but they are used a lot more sparingly than they used to be  instead everything takes a back seat to the action normally i wouldnt mind this since the action is usually also quite good in qt movies but in this case its just overkillthe first couple of blood fountains decapitations and dismemberments are fun but after that it just gets old very fastmany of the gore simply isnt shocking or entertaining enough to keep my attention the fact that you dont really care about any of the characters dying doesnt really help either that being said there are some truly great action scenes like the fight between the bride and gogo the sadistic school girl and some parts of the showdown with the dozens of masked yakuzas but for every great scene theres at least one that just drags on way too long or is just pointless is far from a terrible movie since there are still enough flares of brilliance to make it quite entertaining but there are too many times at which the action becomes boringoverkillpointless or the narrative become simply a bit boring in the end they should have probably just cut a lot of scenes from this movie and its followup and just combine them into a 2 hour movie 12 out of  stars,cruel
vol 1 is the best movie ive seen made in the new century everything about this film is brilliant the action sequences are beautiful the dialogue is great and typical tarantino the references to other movies are unlimited and therefore it is a joy to watch the music isas always in tarantino moviesvery well picked out and very originalalthough some people will probably think that it has too much blood and violencemove over ichi it never goes over the edge because of its constant absurdity levelan absolute instant classic  1010,cruel
was one of the most awaited films this year and i am completely satisfied after seeing it i had read lots of reviews bofore going to the movie theater and pretty knew that it would be a violent and bloody film yes it was even more bloody that i could expect and even more shocking and even better than i could imagine i am not going to write a long and informative review since i am not an advanced critic i only can say an opinion from a perspective of a typical film watcher and quentin tarantino fan thanks to quentin for yet another great work i didnt see vol2 yet but even now i can say  this film is awesome just as all other tarantinos movies are now waiting for vol2,cruel
i was totally blown away by this incredible movie with the musicscenagrophy and coolness of this film  maybe you wonder about some trivial things like movies need to have a good story to succeed well this proves that sometimes the story doesnt really matter this is a enormous movie even though i really dont understand why,cruel
here is the evidence how the music is the part of the movie its a very bloody rough brutal movie and i feel as i come from the cinema that its a beautiful film this is why quentin tarantino is one of the greatest artists in the world and of course the humor that so characteristic of tarantino everyone must hear the song bang bangmy baby shot me down from nancy sinatra ive never heard before so much melancholy like in this song everyone must see this movie,cruel
it started quite promising weird surprising funny situations but hen   yawn it became one of those bmovies tarantino obviously watches too much cmon be honest just because pulp fiction was one of the best movies ever made i doesnt qualify for the top 250 i was really trying to like it but in the end just felt empty and disappointed like after an expensive concert that did not match the expectationsseems tarantino was too much in love with his movie and could not decide what to leave and let cut half of it and make one movie of both parts may be then it looses its spoiling lengths and becomes entertaining but even then  acting will not become betterthurman was not moving very convincing as a samurai eg,cruel
is not just about samurais we have seen them in many movies before and if it were just about that the experience would be rather dull is the world of quentin tarantino there comicstrip heroes move around in a psychedelic music from latin americajapanmexicoeuropeus the atmosphere is surrealbut above all the striking point of this movie is that every scene is perfectly shot tarantino is savvy with the camera angles closeups colors and backgrounds are all in placeminute after minute he sculpts before us this 21st century poem,cruel
simply one of the best movies this year  at the same time it is one of the most violent movies ive ever seen it is the only one that was fully enjoyable from the beginning to the end especially with the great soundtrack  i should say that i noticed something from other users comments even the negative comments on the movie recommends it go for it  i cant wait for vol2  the dvd release for vol1 1010 ,cruel
fans of quentin tarantino might be disappointed by this latest release anyone expecting another stylised crime caper with one of his trademark fasttalking wisecracking scripts might not find what theyre looking for here nontarantino fans meanwhile will probably stay away for the same reasonsbut lets forget all about them for this is a martial arts movie fans dream come truethe very straightforward plotline can be summedup in a single word revenge the larger than life characters are colourfully realised and placed not in the real world but in a magical world of blood swords and violence the story itself serves largely to setup some truly mouthwatering fight sceneswithout wishing to give anything away the last third of the movie is basically a great big fight scene choreographed by the ubiquitous yeun woping and beautifully shot this was an absolute joy to watch when uma thurmans character the bride arrives at the house of blue leaves a breathtaking twenty minute samurai sword battle ensues which is almost impossible to watch without having a big cheesy grin plastered on your face throughoutwith its aircompressed jets of blood and comic undertone the stylised violence is easily palatable and becomes quite beautiful at times combine this with another fine tarantino soundtrack plus the hugely entertaining supporting performances of sonny chiba gordon liu and chiaki kuriyama this is by far the most entertaining cinema experience of the yearquite simply if youre a fan of the genre you cannot fail to enjoy this film and will be left yearning for volume two,cruel
i know japan history and traditions very bad but to my mind even the japanese would happy to see this movie like me tarantino make a new unique movie which are not similar to his others this movie are not similar to any others sometimes it look like western sometimes like anime sometimes like honghong action but as a whole it isnt western anime or any other it just 4th tarantinos movie,cruel
vol1 is in my opinion one of the best films made over the past few years is a story about a woman uma who worked for the deadly viper assassination squad her code name is black mamba she quit the squad got married and pregnant bill the leader of the squad attacks black mambas wedding splattering everyone everywhere this is about where the film starts off  we see black mamba in the church and bill shoots her in the head she goes into a coma for four years when she wakes up she is one angry assassin she wants revenge  so she writes a tokill list of five deadly assassins and their boss bill and goes out on a roaring rampage of revenge  as the punch line saysof course i am telling you this in chronological order unlike the film where quentin has splattered the movie all over the place  as normal this is not bad of course it makes you think and you will enjoy the movie more vol1 is all its meant to be its ultra bloody has heaps of ultra cool fight sequences which all look real and an ultra great cast the story hops along quickly it never leaves you bored no one should complain about it being split in two because the first half alone goes for almost two hours we are left at the end of the movie with a cliff hanger  and no this is not the sort of cliff hanger where someone has a gun to the main characters head and you know they will get out of it  its 100 times better than thatthe film also includes an anime sequence that tells a story of orens past this is a really good anime sequence  you will enjoy it the whole film is done in a way that follows that sequence  when someone gets a leg chopped off the blood will keep spurting out like a fountain  quite funny at times the violence isnt that bad because it is done in a humorous way and is quite unbelievable and low impact the soundtrack is great it really goes with the movie the music made you laugh at some points because it just didnt seem appropriate but it was in a wayoverall vol1 is a must see movie and is defiantly not a waste of money just because it is split in two the first half alone is better than most film experiences you will ever have  so if you havent seen vol1 see it today 1010,cruel
has turned out to be a rather incomplete piece of art because a lot is weak and a lot is missing here is what i mean first of all sophisticated choreography and editing do not hide that uma thurman cannot fight the training sequence  unmissable element for any decent martial arts revenge movieis poor the way the bride finishes off her first victims in the hospital is rather uninspired her exsquad sister looks kinky but quite out of shape and has not a single good line the bride uses the best sword ever made and orenishii praises its quality in her final breath  so why dont we see it being manufactured there could have been many ways of making it a memorable sequence the yakuza dinner scene does not pull any strings the go go yubari character is great but the introduction of her violent madness is boring she kills a poor idiot in a bar  is that the craziest thing she did there is no fine dialogue then this whole movie is slow and rather short while some scenes are still too long  why cut it in two there are also scenes i did not understand like the motorbike ride extensive exposure of the list with bills hand and the sheriffs senseless conclusions on the wedding slaughter scenery bill himself was too stupid to kill the bride but then finds it below standard to kill her in the hospital  the mountain of preparation time that tarantino has taken cannot be found back in the movie it looks like the script has been glued together in weeks in the end there are many open identity questions involving husbands parents daughters bill and the bride this who is whoidea can only work if you really burn to know the solution a feeling that i frankly miss so despite sonny chiba a beautiful animation sequence and the gorgeous snow falling in the garden showdown this movie is like the band at the restaurant looking better than it is,cruel
having enjoyed pulp fiction and even jackie brown i had great hopes for vol 1 i was impressed with production design score and cinematography in general but couldnt get myself to enjoy the completely overthetop bloodeffects even though i knew they were supposed to be that way as a reference to certain cheap martialarts movies i should say that i havent seen any of those so maybe thats why i couldnt enjoy as much as people who did the shifting in time which was a masterstroke in pulp fiction seemed forced to me in and i found most of the dialog either boring or silly no complains about the really simple revengestory but the second half of the movie was nearly all fighting which became somewhat tiresome for me i liked the cast and was especially looking forward to seeing david carradine as bill  he seems like the perfect choice to me even though i hear he wasnt tarantinos first choice  so i was disappointed to see so little of him in vol 1 i am definitley going to see vol 2 but with greatly reduced expectations,cruel
i think that the thing tarantino has a talent for is to do bloody movies because he always do the violence so funnyi never seen a movie so bloody as but you will laughat the violencethis movie has a good story about a strong revenge from a women and its good filmed and good musicone of the best movies i ever seen,cruel
all you sad people who think that is overrated unworthy or whatever just dont appreciate a good film when you see it first of all tarantino is a genius and the fact that hes never won an oscar only proves how unique this filmmaker really is just doing what he wants putting his heart into it and not appealing to the mainstream fans the guy is basically having a good time while creating an exhilarating avantgarde nonapologetic explosion of a moviethe problem with people who dislike this picture is that they think of tarantino as the film school graduate deeply philosophical type when in fact the man did his homework at a video store proving that you dont have to be hollywoods favorite pet in order to make good movies you just make them and try to have some fun while going at it some people will like it others wont but thats the great thing about good movies  they make you feel for better or for worse indifference is the worst form of criticism so i ask whats so wrong about a film that pays homage to those actionpacked btype kung fu movies that we all grew up on well at least some of us its fun its crazy the cinematography is spectacular the dialogues are as always sharp and very selfaware in a tarantino sort of way the soundtrack is superb another tarantino trademark the anima sequence was outstanding and a brilliant touch all in all i had great fun watching this movie maybe thats why i went to see it 3 timesand i laughed my ass off sometimes people forget that films can be enjoyed simply because theyre fun to watch even if sometimes they dont contemplate on deeply intellectual matters which is not entirely true about qts films so if people cant just have pure fun from watching a movie then why bother,cruel
the film looks great i was hoping for a bit more dialogue though and the story is pretty shallowuninteresting i heard the second film has more dialogue and hopely there will be some more curiosity suspense and surprise i still liked it though as a big fan of japaneseasian movies,cruel
i am do not usually write comments but this has to be commentedis one of the best fight movies i have seen it has been a long while since i did not see such a great camera work or art direction although it is certanly not a movie that is for the weak ones if you can have some good old violence you simply must see thistarantino is back,cruel
is tarantino making films just for me or what this mans finger is so close to my pulse i may sue for sexual harassment god will be cut that line alone is worth my ugc monthly fee if i put my critical hat on its gray sensible and veryvery boring i could find faults but id much rather keep my geek hat on its red and says hail to the king baby in green neon and say bring on part two,cruel
this time qu give us a pulp comic to remember  compared to pulp fiction is based more on images than characters  the bride the viper squad  and the rest  are closer to comic drawings than script characters martial arts and  morricone whistles a homage to all kungfu bmovies ever made,cruel
this movie kind of spoils all other movies for me probably until volume 2 there is just no way of improving on this other movies can be fun but this one is cinemas finest hourand a half1010,cruel
doesnt have much of a story besides revenge but it doesnt need one it the way the film is done with its throw back to 70s action films and its stylish action sequences you just keep watching because you dont know whats going to happen next thats whats so fun about quentin tarantinos films i believe pulp fiction will always be his best but this film is next in line ive seen the film twice already and cant wait for the dvd i dont care if it hasnt made that much at the box office or has had limited playing time in small venues this can just be our movie for the movie goers who really want to see something different,cruel
after the dissapointing and well made jackie brown quentin tarantino is back and as great as evervol1 is in my opinion that shouldnt be missed by anyone the plot itself is divided into chapters but not in chronological order similarly to tarantinos other work but this turns out to be far more effective than i thought it would be the characters themselves are given enough depth to them and the acting is fine uma thurman delivers a great and beliveable performance the cinematography is beautiful and amazingly done the music its a league in itself tarantino perfectly knows how to use music in his films effectively but best of all this is a highly entertaining movie its been a long time since ive had so much fun while being in a movie theaterhighly recommended 910,cruel
volume 1 reveals the directors love for his deepest inspirations  the film filled with enthusiasm from cast and crew alike glistens like the sword its main character emulates  congratulations to mister tarantino on creating another groundbreaking piece of cinemaone that makes michael the ham sandwich bay look like a scared child scampering up and down the hollywood freeway asking jerry buckheimer for a gum ball,cruel
just a good martial arts flick  dont expect anything from the plot  the writing is weak as well there are some really bad lines  many of worst lines are in the conversation between uma and vivica in the kitchen near the beginning of the movie  but this is topped later on by the worst line of the movie silly rabbit tricks are for kids  what compelled quentin tarantino to include this stupid stupid reference form the trix kids cereal i have no ideathere are some funny parts though like when there are about 100 men lying in blood in the restaurantclubbar near the end and they are moaning and rolling around  but there are stupid parts as well like when those three guys with swords come running down the stairs at uma and then time she spanks the little boy with her sword  the trouble with this movie is that it doesnt know if it wants to be realistic or cheesy  it flip flops back and forth which makes all the cheesy parts annoying  typical qt type movie though either you like it or you dont in my opinionoverall though i enjoyed the action and it was a generally entertaining movie but because of the reasons above i give it a 710,cruel
once again quentin tarantino hasnt failed to deliver a movie thats different is very stylish and granted it doesnt have much dialogue but it isnt necessary the film flows from beginning to end and i cant wait for volume 2,cruel
i grew up going to china town to watch the old school martial arts movies quentin tarantino is a genius he captures all of the subtelties in culture and timing of fight scenes and sequences the blue room fight scene at the end was breathtaking he should get an academy award for cinematographylucy liu uma and the entire cast were crisp in their performances the writing was sublimetarantino has done it again,cruel
i never thought id say this but this movie is way too violent  but that i can deal with the major problem is that the scenes were too long  the fight scences seemed to go on and on and on  this is one movie that was dragged out so that they could make two,cruel
i loved this movie i really didnt expect to like it as friends had informed me it didnt have much of a plot and theres lots of plot holes how did she recover so quickly where did she get money and passports etc but as someone pointed out to me its got more than enough style to make up for these things it looks and sounds beautiful for those that say its stupid and ridiculous theyre forgetting that thats the whole point granted the plot is very simple and riddled with plotholes but as i said that seems to be the whole point tarrantino deliberately filled the movie with plotholes and mistakes  or so he claims this is normally not the type of movie i would like but i simply loved everything about it a bloody seductive carnage and bloody entertaining to boot go q  umy favourite parts include the animated sequence with lucy lius character as a young girl uma taking on 88 combats in the house of blue leaves easily beats the matrix reloaded with keanu and the 100 agent smiths the tasteful black  whitesilhouette scenes that help increase the gore impact and the samurai holders on the airplane i cant wait for volume 2,cruel
with trash like cat in the hat and legally blonde 2 being released left and  right its nice to know that filmmakers like quentin tarantino still make movies  because they love film not for the money they can make  that being said kill  bill volume i is the best film of the last four years and when combined with the  soontobereleased volume ii the two will likely be a four hour masterpiece   though not better than tarantinos previous work on its own volume i  accomplishes more before the opening credits than other brainless sequels produce after the end credits  other than having flawless direction especially in  the house of blue leaves sequence and wonderful pacing the films music is stellar tomoyasu hotei santa esmerelda nancy sinatra and most importantly  ennio morricone create a perfect atmosphere for each of their own scenes  the next opportunity you have to see this wonderful film do not pass it up to see  anything else unless of course the other choice is pulp fiction or reservoir  dogs,cruel
quentin has surpassed himself and converted this cinema goer into a fan of japanese anime  now weeks after seeing the film the images are still buzzing in my head helped along by the brilliant soundtrack that i bought hours after seeing the film  in fact the marriage between sight and sound in this movie was so effective that i ended up believing i could both taste and smell it  my senses were overwhelmedthis will be the first time that i go back to the cinema to see a movie for the second time this is simply because i cant wait for the dvd which i shall get as well  yes its that good and yes wow doesnt get there either,cruel
some spoilersi just returned from the cinema where i saw this fourth film by quentin tarantino even though i really find that true romance also is unmistakably an original quentinmoviei was warned by friends and others that i might be in for a disappointment when seeing this which is very far away from the gangsterstyle movies we normally see from qt from frame one i was really flabbergasted the shaw scope trailer was funny but the first few minutes of the movie were amazing the black  white scene with mostly the look in the eyes of uma followed by the opening credits accompanied by the wonderful song by nancy sinatra shivers down my spinei will probably talk more about this movie on another time and date when i see it againbut know i will end this comment with something that i noticed in some other reviewssome people complained about things that they found not plausible things like the blood escaped from the body like it was a fountain or how was uma able to take a samurai sword on an airplanefor those people i have some advice this thing called that you have witnessed is called a movie most movies and most certainly this one are a product of the imagination of someone and do not happen in real life its called fictionfunny how was uma able to take a samurai sword on an airplane comes from people who are real movieaddicts probably the same addicts that love very realistic movies like star wars or lord of the rings i never see comments about those movies where they state ehhhh those gollums do not really exist or the sound of explosions cannot be heard in space,cruel
sometimes people need to have a certain kind of mindset before going to see a movie at the theatre for example  leave your brain at the door when you go see elf with will ferrel  when seeing a romance dont be mad if it has an obvious ending  if you go see a horror movie do not worry about getting freaked out even if youre there on a first datein general allow yourself to enjoy the movie no matter what genre it is you paid to see besides if you already paid for it you might as well enjoy itthat being said a person will most enjoy if they watch the flick with an open mindfirst of all it is not a typical film if you are even remotely familiar with tarentinos work then that should not suprise you is a very unique take on the kungfu fighting movies of oldwhat one might first notice is the oddball plot manipulations well like i said tarentino has his ways what remains salient is keeping an open mind and letting yourself enjoy the movietarentino employs a very distinctive technique with his storytelling everything comes together to create an extremely vivid lush and highly exciting movie with very intriguing characterstwo scences that seem to stick out in my mind 1 when oren ishii and her gang walk down the hallway all decked out with that killer soundtrack playing in the background what style oh my 2 again with oren ishii this time in the winter garden the backdrop of the scene is magnificent the japenese garden with its soft whites and blues set up the last fight scene nicely the scene really takes off as oren ishii slips off her slippers and the music starts playing another brilliant trackone thing is consistent with most brilliant directors their use of every technique at their disposal kubrick attained fame with his notorious manipulation of very distinct filming techniques and every famous scene of his masterpieces will stand witness same with coppola and the other greatsin tarentino uses intricate plot vivid character development use of japenese anime various cutting edge special effects a brilliant soundtrack and plain old good story telling he is at or nearing his peak enjoy,cruel
as i watched the opening credits and the beginning of this movie i wondered what to expect i knew there was going to be some heavy kungfu but would it be cheesy matrixstyle action with recycled tarantino styleno way within about 5 minutes of watching the movie i immediately felt the same energy that i felt when i originally watched resevoir dogs and pulp fiction this is tarantino at his finest in fact he was totally unrestrained this situations and content in this movie are brutally gritty at times yet presented in such a way that i found myself chuckling throughouti think one of tarantinos most unique talents is being able to tell a story by skipping back and forth through different parts of the timeline i cant imagine this story being told any other way the camera techniques were incredible the performances were incredible the editing is incredible and the blood and gore is extremely entertaining this is an instant classic i can hardly wait for volume ii mild spoiler look closely at the name on the cereal box in the opening scene it has some humourous significance as to how the scene concludes itself,cruel
i dont really know what to say about this film except for it was amazing i went into the theatre thinking the movie would be good but i left thinking it was one of the best movies ive ever seen  the previews made it look kind of like a corny action flick and it was really a story about raw hatred revenge and a woman who got her whole life taken from her  so many scenes in this film got my heart pumping the anime scene the crazy 88 massacre scene the final showdown between oren and the bride the whole sequence with hattori hanzo and of course the amazing cliffhanger ending i loved it all  i saw this movie 3 times within the first two days of release thats how much i loved it  it really moved me too and i personally thank quentin tarantino for pumping out one of the best films i have ever seen,cruel
quentin tarantino has done it again  bravo  not only is brilliant it is amazing a vengeance movie without mercy its true either you like it or hate it i loved it   the fight scenes and the bloodbath  wow    i cant wait for vol 2 i hope to see as much or more bloodbath than in vol 1  the script is brilliant  as usual you find tarantino humor everywhere throughout the movie for example his addition of classic hattori hanzo  sonny chiba and uma carrying a sword in an airplane but look carefully near the end in the airplane she wasnt the only one carrying a sword there was another sitting next to her also with a samurai sword howabout the fight sequence between vernita green copperhead stopping for coffee  hilarious some might comment on the fake blood flows but hey  thats the charm of a tarantino film you want real blood flow watch a documentary lucy liu  oren ishii  is just brilliant cold and graceful i would also like add on about the soundtrack in the opening sequence song bang bang was remarkable choice that made it a tarantino film  with the combination talents of musician rza the soundtrack is a hit ,cruel
oh my god what is it with you people embarrassing is the right word for most of the reactions to tarantinos new movie which was boring and lame for almost the entire 111 minutes not moving commentators felt compelled to compare it to matrix for absurd reasons but they were right in that both movies are equally overrated and hyped i am talking about the first of the trilogy never saw the sequels because number one clearly explained that all there was going to come up was even more silly coats sunglasses and a triggerhappy karate kid saving the real world reloaded bullshit ha hanow tarantino did produce some decent moments of film and of course he recycled some of his better ideas in the res doggish i shoulda been black mamba the pulpish biblical revenge prattle etc as for the talk of being a movie about movies it has to be said once and for all that even the lamest okami or zatoichi flick is more entertaining and exciting than this one major problem of the movie of course was uma whom some people may like as an actor and whom quentin evidently is very fond of but who simply cant deliver one single move or even glance in a convincing fashion i am not even talking about the admittedly difficult iaidowork every single opponent our heroine engaged looked better with the sword than she did i am talking about those badly performed justin timberlake jumps and the fact that two months in the gym might have done her some good the monty pythonesque kitchen fight in the beginning was nothing but an eyeroller but that was true for most of the movie my aunt jemima would have done a better job with the help of some computer work and a baggy bruce lee costume thats for sure the sound engineers tried to make up for the lack of verve with loads of noises but hey who is afraid of dinosaurs that roar like kelloggs lions the music doesnt deserve any comments anybody who didnt expect spanish tunes or at least andean panpipes in the final snowcovered japanese garden scene well it didnt look like snow to me actually hadnt understood quentins rather halfassed postmodern gimmickry there were some remarkable moments in the movie though the animation sequence was perfect and should have set the pace for the movie but it didnt it was intense and it revealed all the things was not the barefoot band was awesome but where were they when things got interesting gone like every hope mr timbertino or mr brown could pull this off,cruel
oh wow its a lot of fun to watch a quentin tarantino movie when hes at the top of his game like he is here  ive read and heard quite a few reviewsopinions about this movie and i can understand why its a loveitorhateit kind of thing it all depends on your reaction to the violence and gore which is the polarizing factor with this film  i put on my comic book violencecolored glasses and thoroughly enjoyed the experiencethere are two things that qt did so right with both pulp fiction and the use of music to create the perfect atmosphere and his mastery of a nonlinear presentation of the storyline  first the music qt has an uncanny ability to bring a smile to your face or make you cringe in the case of reservior dogs simply by the music he chooses  i dont know how he does it but its always just right  from the opening credits of pulp fiction with the changing of the radio stations to the nancy sinatra tune and mexijapanese songs in it helps to create a memorable experience  second the nonlinear storyline  while its not used quite as effectively as pulp fiction its still effortless and entertaining  i mean really theres not much of a plot here so it adds some interest but the story is kind of besides the point  its a tribute to the genre with the qt spin on it  cant wait for vol 2,cruel
from time to time there are these movies that absolutely puts you back where you belong as a viewer crunched down in your seat vol 1 hits you in the face like a fist and keeps on hammering until the very end all the main characters are impressively played and uma thurman does along with lucy liu one of the most spoiler ahead cool samurai scenes i have ever seen the plot setting with the slight shifting between animelooking characters and movements and raw and brutal american action movie gives the final twist to this masterpiece the music is also nicely set and after buying the cd im now only looking forward to vol 2 and a dvd release with an interview with the man himself please thank you tarantino thank you for making postmatrixlife worth it ,cruel
a long time ago in a cinema far far away i saw a film called pulp fiction dripping with pop culture references littered with quotable but more importantly accessible dialogue and smothered in cant laugh will laugh violence it was the best film i had ever seenis not pulp fiction but it is a descendant of all that pulp fiction stands for and in my opinion is best used as an indication of how perfect a film maker tarantino will becomei wont bother with the plot although important and omnipresent during the viewing of this first of the two volumes of i always subconsciously held the premise that any questions would be answered in volume two and what freedom that gave me to sit back and enjoy a craftsman so aptly and ably applying his tools tarantino is the whole reason i hear media students arguing out style over content issues and never really answering themshot in so many varied styles you could be watching five different films from five different cultures  most noticeably the crossreferencing from eastern and western cinema including a breath taking anime sequence which is so seemless that kurisowa might well have shot certain sequences with bruce lee flapping around as stunt coordinator  tarantino repeatedly bombards his now devoted audience with aesthetic and aural setpieces that look like theyll spiral off screen but are executed with such control that they become perfection from the first smashing domestic rumble to the blue lit silhouette sword fight your pupils will dilate and your eardrums will vibrateever present are the injokes spoiler copperhead vivica a fox concealing a pistol in a cereal box with kaboom written on the side before attempting to kaboom uma thurman into next week and although dialogue may not be as sharp or as memorable as the rest of his cannon tarantino keeps the script succint and to the point never losing sight of the fact that this story is about revenge and when revengins being done theres not much time for discussions about big macsi might have made them up but i felt so many connections between this film and pulp fiction that i almost linked their stories together there are the inconspicuous references the closeups on the pussy wagon keys uma drawing out an imaginary square to vivica fox but my main question was are the deadly viper assasination squad in anyway related to the fox force five that mia wallace uma thurman mentions in pulp fiction in it she describes a black demolitions expert vivica a fox a japanese swordstress lucy liu and a french seductress spy julie dreyfuss maybe my mind played havoc but it certainly adds another dimension to tarantinos incredible movie intellectdoes style dominate yes but is content ever sacrificed hell no my proof is that the bride uma thurman is so filled with rage bitterness and betrayal that i havent met a person yet that didnt root for her and character is what tarantinos films are aboutas ever the music is perfect when a track needs to fit tarantino will use it nancy sinatras bang bang after umas skull crunching gunshot wound but give him the freedom to apply music to a sequence with no musical boundaries and hell throw in a tune that opposes everything we see but still drags image and sound screaming and kicking together the heightened strings in the anime sequence just before the blood rains downin short see see it for the soundtrack the action allegedly the whole film cost only 23 of the matrix budget the central female character thurmans performance is unbelievable considering her alluring freespirited turn in pulp fiction the pure education in global cinema but see it most of all so that you can remember just how good you had tarantino mapped out to be hes getting even better soon enough every director from woo to scorsese will be shaking in his bootsand if you can get bernard hermanns twisted nerve from daryl hannahs introduction sequence out of your mind ill give you a tenner,cruel

this film is packed with a bit of everything bruce lee james bond animation and suspensethis film is the best of 2003 and if bruce lee was alive today he would jump at the chance to play this role as the fight sequences are just as brillant as enter the dragon against the odds tarrantino has pulled it of and will be around for decades to come,cruel

violence is now an artform i love it makes the matrix reloaded look like the rugrats go to paris and matrix revolutions look like earnest goes to camp tarantino is brilliant his masterwork of the screen is paralelled only by his choice of soundtracks to accompany the story really nailing the whole 70s atmosphere down this is a masterpiece in disguise  a true modern epic revolving around honor and truth yet it has the action appeal of your standard action film to make it even more amicable,cruel
perhaps tarantino has nothing more to give this stylistic excuse of nothingness cant help but make you wonder where is the raw talent behind reservoir dogs the pure genius behind pulp fiction and the mature solid director behind jackie brown sorry quentin but its getting boring to play spot the reference okay its worth the price of admission but that couldnt be what such a charismatic guy can expect from his audience,cruel
until the final fight scene this movie is nothing spectacularit is easily tarantinos worst movie unless you have seen who do you think youre fooling and you realize how much of a plagiaristic ripoff reservoir dogs actually was  but at least reservoir dogs didnt come off as completely contrived like this movie did some will suggest that this was tarantinos purpose and he was attempting to be ironic but there was nothing ironic about it the only good things about this movie were lucy liu chiaki kuriyama who was awesome in this movie and the final fight scene610,cruel

since this is only half a film i can only form half an opinion on it i liked some of what i saw  a lot  but it was sandwiched between bits that bored the last thurmanliu scene baffled the you prepare sushi i bring sake shtick and generally annoyed me youve made your point qt so go easy on the cheesy oriental cinema homages would ya some of it simply made me cringe the dialogue between thurman and vivica a fox thuds like a severed head hitting the floortarantino has clearly made to amuse himself and doesnt really give a flying foot massage whether he entertains his audience its certainly brash bloody and different but love it or hate it hes too cool or so he thinks to carei have a sneaking suspicion that was always intended to be released in two parts with the last minute decision to split a single movie being a savvy bit of marketing between himself and miramax who as everyone knows are particularly adept at that gamevol 2 will determine whether ive been party to maverick moviemaking at its most audacious or just a director having a wonderful time with someone elses money,cruel
some spoilers includedrevenge it is the oneword summary of the plot could not be more transparent with the main heroine periodically reaffirming the goal to kill all the members of the divas yet the plots brazen simplicity becomes the skeleton for tarantino to build on the muscle fibers of his homemade storytellingthe first scene of the movie explicitly introduces the storys timeframe the 60s or the 70s the story itself does not flow seamlessly but assumes an anachronistic sequence the time steps are range from few days of travel to a few years of coma since very early on the viewer learns of the revenge as the fuel for black mambas unstoppable rage tarantinos manipulation with the time sequence affords a graceful flow of the movie towards the first manifestation of the revenge as the fight  between cottonmouth and black mamba which chronologically belongs to the beginning of the film alongside this adjusted timeframe the visual and cinematographic elements pick the pace as well with the final fight being the zenith of the first moviethe visual effectiveness of is astounding throughout the film tarantino genius delivers the highly stylized violence with the backdrop of fluid atmosphere that seems to ooze from the screen and onto the minds of the viewers yet the rest of the movie fades away if compared with the cottonmouth fight following the seemingly mundane and gory fight with the cottonmouths private army the fight between black mamba and cottonmouth happens in another world cottonmouths immaculately white kimono complements the tranquility of the snowed japanese garden and the menacing snow clouds black mambas poisonousyellow biker suite reaffirms her presence as a stark contrast and a deadly challenge to the cottonmouths homeworld  the battle elegant with courtesy is perfectly timed with only other mobile element of that particular set the snow and the fountain water with the color scheme and the choreography the battle seems more of a phenomenon of the natural forces rather than the action of human mind of course black mamba prevails with a coup de grace worthy of the grand fightonce again tarantino has shattered the stifling cinematographic limits of hollywood undoubtedly is another permanent milestone by tarantinos genius in the history of  world cinema,cruel
ok it seems that a few people dont like the film because of the pointless violence and lack of a plot  and sure the plot is not oscarworthy and the violence is a little over the top ok a lot over the top  but the purpose of this movie is not to engage our spirits with the pain of love and the hope for a better tomorrow and all that other crap  its to have a good time in the movies  the movie is absolutely beautiful my three favorite scenes are the anime one the gogo fight and the shadow fighting scene and the soundtrack rocks  its such a blast to listen to  overall if you just want to have a good time this movie is for you,cruel

i have reservations about awarding such a violent brutal obviously offensive irresponsible production a 1010 i thought id seen enough women viciously beaten andor raped in popular film over the last few decades but i guess i was wrong and oh yes the women are violent themselves i suppose thats some sort of excusehowever vol 1 is one of the most entertaining films i have ever seen it incorporates everything proven enjoyable by film history it is natural born killers meets the empire strikes back meets crouching tiger meets enter the dragon meets the crow meets a lot of other shiny recent movies that take the concept of aesthetic pleasure to a whole new leveleverybody rocked everything rocks,cruel

a beautiful pregnant woman called the bride uma thurman is going to marry but a guy named bill david carradine puts an end to that he and 4 other members of the divas dealy viper assassination squad kill everybody on the wedding but the bride survives and lies in a coma for 4 years she wakes up and decides to take revenge on the divas and bill she was a former member of the divas whats in her advantage she can track down oren ishii lucy liu codename cottonmouth the most feared person of the divas and also vernita green vivica a fox codename copperheadquentin tarantino promised uma thurman a movie like this they discussed this on the set of pulp fiction and this is the result a real masterpiece it begins with a simple plot but it thickens by the minute its fun in the beginning but it really gets more interesting by every second and its not easy to make a movie like that nowadaysquentin tarantino is one my favorite directors because he can mix violence with humor very well hes more known for his scenarios and again he made a very strong and terrific script even though he doesnt make a lot of movies he really takes more time for making them than most directors do thats why his movies are all great hes so enthusiastic and puts much effort in his work and his pen and mind are one when it comes to writing scripts he doesnt act much but hes certainly not a bad actor he grew up with movies and he still isnt tired of it another thing i like about him is that he gives actors who are forgotten a second chance john travolta is the biggest example now david carradine for and he always gives winks to other movies like the yellow suit that uma thurman wears in it refers to bruce lee his idea of using a japanese animation images in is really original even though it was really violent and again this movie is not chronological thats how we remember our little quentin he said in an article that the violence in his movies is unbearable but that it really looks damn cool damn straight quentinthe movie is very interesting and uma thurman is terrific as the bride she trained intensively for 3 months and she had just given birth and the result is a beautiful dangerous woman in a tight yellow costume the blood is all over the place but that doesnt really matter the sprinkles with original ideas like the japanese anime the sound of the mosquito that goes around in the dolby surround system of the movie theater the pussy wagon the movie consists of extremely cool fight scenes like the fight between the bride and gogo and the crazy 88 and of course oren ishii in the house of the blue leaves with beautiful spanish flamenco music on the background the music was also  nice through the whole movie the scene of the house of the blue leaves in particular the music is totally in contrast with the duel between the bride and oren ishii but thats the beauty of it it makes the duel look more like a dance number or a ceremony but its also a lesson for directors use music that lies parallel with the scene or use music that is totally in contrast with the scenethrough this whole experience of 111 minutes i can only say that was fun to watch its a masterpiece made by a genius and i cant wait for vol 2 keep up the good work quentin910,cruel
a cocktail with too many ingredientsfirst of all this review contains spoilers ok right lets move oni saw kbv1 last night and i have to say i dont think it works as a contemporary piece of cinema  fans of this movie will almost certainly say the reason i dont like tarantinos 4th film is because i dont get it however id argue those people who say they do get it dont get why it fails  but before anybody starts thinking yeah but youve not seen this movie or that movie let me give you an analogyyou know how every so often games developers try to blend together several genres into one video game  theyll take the platform action of super mario the fighting of tekken the gunplay of devil may cry and add the aerial combat of gpolice and the driving of gran turismo then dress it up like a star trek game and attempt to give it the atmosphere of resident evil  it doesnt work does it for one reason or another it will fail thats how i see the film hops from one style to another and doesnt settle down until the conclusion in the blue leaves restaurant by which point the tension and mood built up at the very beginning of the movie has been evaporated by the lack of consistency  its a shame because at first it does feel as distressing and unsettling as such legendary revenge movies as i spit on your grave and baismoitarantino is famous for jumbling up the sequence of events in his films but unlike pulp fiction in which the nonsequential story telling ultimately fits together like a jigsaw puzzle feels like the back story is tacked on in a vain attempt to add depth to characters whose only aim is to kill or pervert others  the result is that like a video game that tries to mimic several of its peers at once the set pieces in feel disconnected from one another and more like tarantino was desperate to tip the wink at as many hong kong and japanese classics as possible  to have one piece of back story told in bw another in colour and another as an anime means the movie feels like it has no identity  however it is possible to blend different cinematic styles and have it work  the original matrix for example managed to blend film noir with scifi gunplay and kungfu excellently because each had its place and purpose in the story shame the sequels failed to achieve this in the end movie had its own identity despite the fact that like its list of influences is as long as your armhowever biggest failing is that by showing the bride kill the second person on her death list first then going back and spending the rest of the movie telling you about the assassination first person oren ishii means the latter half of the film has no dramatic impact  sure you already know the bride is going to survive the battle in the blues leaves restaurant because vol 2 is out in about six months but to be shown a character is intact and no worse for wear before their big battle just means whats supposed to be the climax of a movie has no punch  the positive conclusion outweighs the drama of the events leading up to it  why do you think sports fans dont like to hear the final score before they watch the match  because if you know how its going to turn out the highs and lows of the event lose their impactthe fight in the blues leaves wasnt all that interesting anyway  like the stupid fight scene in matrix reloaded where neo fights scores of agent smith seeing the bride fight all eightyeight members of the crazy 88 isnt very interesting because the number of opponents makes the scene too cluttered  the choreography might be superb but theres too much going off for you to appreciate it  the scene would have looked better and worked better psychologically if it had involved fewer opponents people can imagine fighting off a dozen opponents at once but not the better part of a hundred  check out the fight in the playground in jackie chans police story 2 if you want to see a fight with onepersonagainstmany done effectivelyending spoiler however i will be going to see volume 2 but only because the cliffhanger the brides unborn daughter surviving her mothers coma i have to say though even thats like something from sunset beach  if volume 1 hadnt ended with that revelation something for the audience to wonder whats the bride going to do when she finds out about that id have no interest in seeing part two at allin all honesty i think the best thing about the whole movie is the signature track battle without honour or humanity by tomoyasu hotei510,cruel
this was an incredible movie experience i just loved every moment  by far is the best movie of 2003 if not the past few years although on the surface a very simple storyit was nevertheless thouroughly entertaining and enjoyable  to the point that you leave the cinema rooting for the bride and her quest of vengeance for me though what really made the film was tarrantinos flair for detailwhich really created a unique character  aspects such as the array of sunglasses on the dashboard of the sherriffs car the closeup of the mosquito sucking blood from the bride and most effectively the solitary sound of the wooden water fountain during the final fight between the bride and oren ishithe soundtrack as well really helps to add to the killer atmosphere  roll on volume 2i simply cant wait,cruel
tarantino hits back with a vengeance with perhaps the best action film of the year its hip its funny its stylish and lord does it kick your booty quentin has taken inspiration from honk kong movies of the seventies mixed it with a funky soundtrack and has churned out something superbly entertaining and at times extremely gory the film has the odd moments of trademark qt dialogue but this feels so different to his other films it is a real departurethe direction is stylish yuen woo pings choreography is outstanding as usual and this is just a very entertaining kung fu movie offering something different to the matrix shenanigans which kungfusiasts have been dying for in hollywood cinema with all the crappy martial art turkeys like the transporter and romeo must die only monsieur jackie chan has made enjoyable martial arts movies in hollywood in recent years good ones are few and far between with most choosing to copy the matrix ahead of the real originsas with all of qts films the movie boasts a superb cast firstly uma thurman is excellent in her comeback she has not done anything major since the stinker that was the avengers  she strikes back to the crown jewels with ferocity and karate kicks the face of the cinema going public as if to say im back i soothed my groin with a bag of frozen peas and thought youre so welcome uma you are so welcome when this film was first announced aside from the feeling of excitement that had me and any movie enthusiast jumping with excitement i couldnt help but think uma thurman all size 6 8 stone of the lass in a kung fu movie with samurai swords and lord knows what else all the fighting all the stuntwork wire work okay a little chauvinist  perhaps and then theres all the charlies angels and the matrix women kicking ass would she be able or would there be a bloke in an uma wig jumping around the room and hacking off peoples arms boy were my mild doubts proved needless i was with the audience in awe when you see her plain as day unleashing kung fu badness of course i did have a similar reaction to keanu reeves in the matrix the fact that the training beforehand and the fact he did most of the fighting himself made it altogether more enjoyable her performance is also top rate holding the movie together the rest of the cast are all very good too with lucy liu darryl hannah and the legendary david carradine amongst othersthis movie is enjoyable it seems very authentic you really feel like your watching a film out of 1970s hong kong and at times it is typically modern the cinematography is crisp and striking the score is authentic and pulsating as per usual the soundtrack is great too overall a great flick it may lack the intelligent scripting of qts first two films but in terms of sheer escapism this is his best 12,cruel
hi everyoneheres my thoughtshope you enjoyfirst off wow how superb was the directing by the alwaysbrilliant quentin tarantino he shocked us with his brilliance with reservoir dogs he proved his brilliance with pulp fiction he continued his brilliance with jackie brown and now he has gone to a new level with his brilliance with vol 1  his direction in the showdown that pits the bride against gogo yubari the crazy 88s and oren ishii was topnotch and a standout piece of direction  the help tarantino received from the outstanding yuen wo ping was invaluable and can be seen throughout the fight sequences however there was one flaw that i noticed how does the bride miracously clean up her face after every fight  thankfully this minor flaw can be overlooked and forgiven due to the awesome fight sequences that surrounded itin a role that uma thurman claimed to be impossible to play she excelled beyond even the highest expectations to give a knockout  performance as the bride aka black mamba in an upanddown career uma has definitely hit a high point playing the revengeseeking brideumas performance was matched by all costars involved including lucy liu as the violent tokyo crime boss oren ishii vivica a fox as the changed women vernita greene and also the legendary sonny chiba as hattori hanzo all these stars complimented umas performance to help this become an allround superb movieminor roles played by daryl hannah as elle driver michael madsen as budd and the unseen david carridine as bill are agonising teasers that make you want to see more of these charactersbut will  have to wait for the second volume to be releasedi must say i had my doubts before seeing the movie in concern with the anime sequence  although after seeing the film i realise why tarantino choose that style to tell the story of oren ishiis childhood  even though i have never been a fan of japanese anime this was one sequence i thouroughly enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked in the moviehowever push aside the brilliant directing push aside the great acting push aside the awesome story push aside the surprisingly entertaining anime sequence and push aside the great fight sequences and visual wit because it is the amazing soundtrack that truly makes this movie a groundbreaker the awesome combination of oldschool martial arts music and typical spaghetti western music is truly a delight to hear and enhances the movie to a level few movies can reachi cant wait for vol 2 to hit australian theatres and hope it matches up to vol 1movies best thing in life tjc,cruel
this is definitely the most entertaining movie ive seen this year but its not up to par with tarantinos other work imho my main impression of the movie is that it serves as the ultimate homage to a variety of asian martial arts films mixed with a heavy influence from anime and cheesy 70s action movies is all style and little substance which is not necessarily a bad thing because this is an amazing movie to watchits hilarious throughout has a great cast and could be regarded as the first authentic liveaction anime but tarantinos trademark depth of characters and storytelling is oddly lacking and extended scenes with little to no dialogue makes the movie seem longer than it should beoverall this is an extremely entertaining movie and is tons of fun to watch but lacks some of the emotional depth prevalent in tarantinos other films i give it  out of four stars,cruel
this movie is amazing not much in the way of plot but the visual and audio aspects are breathtaking and despite the simple plot line this movie is emotionally charged any film buff needs to see this movie,cruel
an asassin whose name is never mentioned but lets call her umamsthurmanwas brutally beaten and shot in the head on her wedding day by her boss bill and five of his assistants now four years after uma wakes up from a coma and realizes that not only she has lost a big part of her life but also her beloved baby uma is furious uma wants revenge uma must kill where should i start not only was this movie fun and exciting from beginning till end it was a crazy mess add some dark humor lots of gore and a really great soundtrack and there you have it but thats not all see this hugely entertaining movie for yourself is the perfect combination of madness and beauty 910,cruel
quentin tarentinos insanely violent homage to exploitation cinema is after the irrelevant selfimportant jackie brown a welcome return to the filmmaking he does best though he seems to be narrowing his audience to film school students and video store geeks the first half features the shockingly graphic americanized violence weve come to expect from him as he sets up a brutal fantasy about a woman known as the bride and played with relish by uma thurman beaten and left for dead on her wedding day after four years in a coma she returns to exact her brutal revenge against her aggressors in this first of two planned pictures she battles two of the five although in typical tarentino fashion not chronologically its in the second half where she travels to japan to  commission a samurai sword from hattori hanzo the legendary sonny chiba in a terrific performance in order to confront oren ishii lucy liu that the violence goes into overdrive turning into a stylized chopsocky fever dream with each overthetop situation outdoing the previous at one point thurman singlehandedly takes on an army of nearly one hundred yakuza though theres plenty of the sadistic misogyny that defines tarentino as a coldhearted egotist who seems immensely gratified seeing women tortured youre reminded of his glee with his captive in from dusk till dawn theres also an overt desire to explain themhe gives each of the first parts major female characters the baggage that comes with being a woman thurman grieves over the child she carried at the time of her attempted murder vivica a fox young daughter interrupts their confrontation and lius childhood characterin a chilling anime sequencesees her parents slain and is a victim of pedophilia its a bid for a pass that doesnt work he cant help but dress up his observations with clever stylizations and he throws them into the mix as juicy tidbits merely to provoke discussion among his acolytes still the film is great fun to watch a nerds passionate desire to regurgitate every exploitive action scene hes ever watched within the context of his art and surprisingly it comes off as sincere and reverent,cruel
this movie is by far one of the greatest ive seen  script is fantastically written and directed uma therman rocks and i dont really think another actor would suit so much to this role im gonna wait for vol2 anxiously,cruel
violent  yes  bloody  yes  darn near perfect  definitely  with the minor exception of a few small editing errors that may actually have been intended anyway this movie defines what movie magic should be  very well written directed acted and choreographed does for the samurai genre what the godfather did for gangster movies  if this movie is approached with an open mind and appreciation of more artistic cinematic ventures then the viewer will be less concerned with the films harsh imagery and more inclined to experience for what it truly isa work of art like no other  bravo to quentin uma etc  it is encouraging to see directors and actors unafraid to explore new territory in the modernday die cut world of hollywood wannabees  best of all were only halfway through this saga,cruel
as a big fan of tarantinos work i must say that this 4 movie is maybe the best the way that was filmed the way the story is told the ost the actors the anime style violence that asian bruce lee old school kung fu samurai touch is perfect all the pieces connect perfectly this film is a work of art cant wait to see vol 2,cruel
ive thought tarantinos films worth seeing until now the movie has a nice mix of esthetics and ok music but falls very short plotwise personally i was very bored during the long hack n slash periods jeez to give a perspective i had no problem with crouching tiger hidden dragon where the fighting was so artfullid recommend this film only for splatter enthusiasts,cruel
pulp fiction was a good film  it had a natural rhythm and set its own limits this  well its cartoon violence that has cartoon violence except its too much to be funny its not slick enough to be entertaining and its too patchy to be a cult film this someone trying to make a cult film and missing the plot so to speak there are some nice touches but like too many films these days there is little scale to the events no real sense of dynamics and completely no reason to give a damn about the main character,cruel
as a japanese person i enjoyed the movie very much  it is so fun to see quentins view of japan or fantasized version of japan  quentins understanding of yakuzasamurai culture is pretty accurate though it is not legal to bring in samurai sword into passenger aircrafts or walk downtown tokyo carrying samurai sword  fully packed with fun i gave it 1010btw i heard that japanese edit is completely different from us edit  i hope r1 dvd version would be unrated would provide us viewers the japanese edit  from what ive heard japanese edit has significant advantages  im still wondering if i should buy r1 dvd or r2 dvd or both,cruel
from the moment it starts you cant help but feel that quentin is back with a vengeance every one of his films to date has been original in every way and does not differthe story dont worry  no spoilers as you may already be aware is about an assassin the bride who is taking revenge on her former colleagues for trying to kill her on her wedding day as well as killing everyone else in the chapelthe film is split in to 5 chapters all of which are highly suspenseful dramatic and original from the first chapter where the bride tries to take revenge on one of the other assassins vernita green qt shows that he is making his mark on the action film world the fight scenes are beautifully choreographed by kungfu expert master wuping who also worked on the matrix trilogythe film is not bogged down by uninteresting dialogue but name a tarantino film that is and each scene is even more thoughtprovoking and painstakingly original than the last however i would say that the film could be shortened in places to sustain the momentum in this respect the film does sag round the edges slightly but the painstaking originality of the plot and characters makes it unstoppably watchablethe anim sequence in the middle is fantastic and masterstroke by tarantino and shows he has for want of a better word the balls to go where other directors wont i wonder how many quentin wannabes will add a sly anim to their film after thisthe film culminates in one of the action sequences to end all action sequences forget whatever youve seen in the matrix including the burly brawl the car chase and superbrawl the house of blue leaves will leave you pining for more it has too much gore and sword action to shake a stick at and leaves you with word pinging around your head  woahoverall i cannot recommend vol 1 enough it is the best film this year apart from maybe return of the king and ends on the type of cliffhanger that matrix reloaded strived for however i would say that it is extremely gory and some viewers may be shockeda solid 9510,cruel
tarantino has always been an eclectic filmmaker lacing his pictures with overdoses of quotes from and references to the kind of stuff he used to watch when young as well as during his job in a video rental each of his previous movies however was something more than just an amalgamate of classic style elements every one of the movies he was involved with up till now the ones he directed himself as well as those he only scripted had something more to set them appart tarantinos movies were sophisticated delicately balanced yet in yourfaceexplodingpowerfull coctails and every good coctail has a twist so did tarantinos flicks until this one  it was the twist that made them totally original totally tarantino tm so to speak its hard to describe what the tarantino twist is about  it has to do with a combination of many elements  plot dialogue the way he directs his actors portrayal of eventsan that is what lacks dont be misunderstanding me  i totally appreciate the amount of work tarantino put in this one  which is to say  obviously a lot the fotography is quite perfect in its dynamic as well as its static qualities sometimes the camera moves frenetically sometimes it stays still and shows the full beauty of the battle choreography every time it is well thought out  every move of the camera every part of the scenery every color every piece of clothing worn by the actors  it all adds up to a painstakingly crafted visual masterpiece  the music as allways is the perfect accompanyment to each piece of imagery presented tarantinos direction is tight effective and spotless and still  there is something lacking none of tarantinos basic plotlines ever were anything new or original yet he did manage to present them as such none of the tarantino dialogues ever were high literature yet they lingered on in the collective cinematic  memory none of the tarantinos actors except for harvey keitel were really anything great dont start me on travolta jackson or madsen please yet tarantino got way more out of them than they ever were worth and that is whats lacking in kb  the dialogue seems bland the plotting linear and featureless the acting very well directed but without any real spunk jackie brown was already suffering from this effect but its only gotten worse with this next installment maybe volume ii will have more to say maybe he should have left it a single movie i do think kb was better than jb simply because i love the burlesque that drives this movie but still  it lacks the twisti cant stop thinking tarantino should also have directed all of those movie scripts that were eventually outsourced to people who simply couldnt create tarantinos vision  natural born killers true romance and even from dusk till dawn would all have made better true tarantino products than final conclusion  go watch it for its technical brilliance and the fun in finding and naming the movie and tv quotes and hope that we get more true tarantino goodness in chapter 2,cruel
for granted most people will sound their opinions from their own perspective and they have every right to but to critic any art form without first trying to understand its motivation and intent is like a heterosexual man calling michaelangelos david a piece of crap simply because he doesnt like to look at another naked manpersonally i enjoyed and i understand its a controversial issue as to many great art works  i do not believe qt intended this to be a serious movie  i believe that qt used excessive blood as a dark humor and qt has been known for dark humors ie reservoir dog pulp fictionetc it is just pure campy fun at asian cult kungfu movies expensebeing chinese and growing up watching kung fu movies i have my share of its influences  i find entertaining because never for one minute i took it to be a serous kung fu movie  like one of the other commenter mentioned if im looking for a serious kung fu movie why would i even chose one shot by an americanthere is no purpose for the excessive violence and bloodiness in other than pure campy fun  as another commenter pointed out if you want a movie with purposeful violence and bloodiness rent saving private ryanis not a masterpiece in the gone with the wind sense  its a masterpiece in that its the first movie of its kind in the american mainstream  its not intended to be a serious kung fu movie if you want that go rent lee angs crouching tiger hidden dragon  its not a real campy chinesejapanese kung fusamuri movie if you want that go rent east the invincible or white hair bride  its strength does not lie in its plot or character development if thats what you are looking for i can give you a whole bunch of other suggestions such as the others  its strength is its simplicity its excessive violence its bloodiness all wrapped in a nice package and get away with it by been shown in large theatres across the nationi find that disappoints from movie watching experience usually rises from mismatched expectations  if you expect to be anything other than what it is intended to be you will definitely be disappointed  but then it would be your personal bias not because the movie has faltered to be what it is intended to be  so maybe try to cast your own expectations aside try to understand the intention of the movie itself first and then watch the movie perhaps youll finally be able to appreciate the movie for what it is,cruel
the movie really had it coming all the way from the start but it could not have been anyway else so overflown it was and yes it really made an impact on audience they were forced to believe the unrealistic setting and free their thoughts the flows of unconscious production  neuroticized by the global economy  were the real aim of the movie the target was set and the film kept it all the way to break free from the penetrating fetishes of modern day hypercapitalism thanks quentin it couldnt have been made any other way it was only possible by combining the slapstick with samurais of kurosawa and the mythic fictions of western movies,cruel
quentin tarantinos is a throw back to the retro 70s revenge movie is not only a tribute but also grand come back to those styles of filmmaking  uma thurman is wonderful and lucy lu is just as great as her adversary  this is the first part of a two part movie and while that is frustrating because i will have to wait to the next chapter to find out what will happen but judging by this movie it will be worth the wait,cruel
do not be fooled by the yakuza setting and the plethora of wuxupian citations this is a fantastic homage to the italian spaghetti western and the clint eastwood movies from the music to the vengeance theme a masterpiece of the bmovies that will be considered by the critics like an a movie dont be fooled this the greatest bmovie of all time but it is still a bmovie and you should be glad for that quentin you are a god,cruel
this film is one of the best films i have ever seen its stylishslickclassy and very watchable ok so its v violent but if u want love n happiness watch finding nemo or bambi it maybe violent but its not unecessary violence its wot the films about but it also manages to be funny in places ill keep it short n sweet by just saying that this film is excellenta modern classic,cruel
in terms of moral and social comment is about as unedifying as a movie gets but and let me make this quite clear who the hell walks into a qt movie expecting to learn not me i went to marvel at the coolness the artistry and yes the fake blood tons of it rain down as the bride carves a trail of vengeance back to the shadowy billqt follows the physics of a revenge movie perfectly given ample opportunity to gain the upper hand by stealth the bride literally goes out on a limb to inform bill that she is coming for him bill for his part really should have finished her off by now so he will only have himself to blame come the finish but these samurai are not permitted an easy kill first they must dance and the dance is where this film is pure unadulterated tarantino light music and dazzling camera combine to pull you into the action as orens crazy 88 kato clones confidently step forward one by one to be slain i got the impression that oren wouldnt have sent them in if the had any chance of killing the bride and the oren revenge itself is a tableau in snow to contrast perfectly with the inevitable blood spillwhile watching the bride will herself to wiggle her toes she reminded me of mia wallace from pulp fiction didnt mia once do a pilot for fox force five maybe someone watched the pilot and offered her a starring roll in a revenge flick the familiarity of the characters new and old their connection to the qt universe is a tarantino trade marksomebody some time ago said something like we should stop trying to find a meaning or purpose to art but to enjoy it for what it is is the best bit of art i have seen all year,cruel
may not be a particularly deep movie but it accomplishes what it sets out to extremely well its a sendup of those cheesy 70s kungfu flicks and spaghetti westerns with a healthy dose of anime and tarantinostyle ultraviolence its shallow and nonsensical and entertaining as hell,cruel
i have given away the main feature of this film in the summary  violence ok other tarantino movies have been violent and it would be naive to expect this latest offering to be as violencefree as a pgrated cartoon flick but it should not be the lasting memory of the movie perhaps i am missing the point of this movie perhaps i was missing something  the plot seemed to be a simple case of revenge revenge exacted in a japanese style which was reflected in the samurai sword massacreing of so many people the effects are impressive  the anime sections are particularly well done it really manages to make you move the emotions and make you cringe at the violence which is impressive for what is essentially a cartoon section the music a vital part to most good movies really makes this film for me  it is what makes it tarantino the music mixing the old western standoffs with the modern makes up for the lack of really great lines  there were good ones but no quotes of pulp fiction proportions the lead role played by uma thurman could not have been played by anyone else  she is simply superb in the role and lucy liu is impressive as a homicidal japanasechineseamerican samuraiswordwielding mafiaesque leader so was this a good movie yes it had essentially a plot which kept you interested to the extent that im now eager to watch the second volume and some great acting performances from the leads with a fairly original section of anime the crouching tiger hidden dragon moments werent so impressive for the obvious reason that they are now oldnews so why the emphasis on violence ok films are more violent these days and this film to some extents needed to be this violent to succeed otherwise this would be a fairly average film  the only problem i have with the level of violence is the way viewers seem to get desensitised to it and even find it funny i myself found it funny by the end i just hope that there arent people watching this movie and seeing that it makes people laugh who then decide to make their own comedy with their own violence with more violence in movies comes the trust that people should be allowed to watch what they like rather than censoring in case a few take it the wrong way and decide to imitate great film for the lads and goryhunters just dont take anyone with a weak stomach i gave it 8 out of 10,cruel
absolutely 100 pure grown action never have i seen a movie that lives so good up to its expectations which it had a lot of being the new tarantino film and all but yet again tarantino achieves to write a movie on same standard as pulp jackie and dogs this film delivers 100 action all the way through along with tarantinos independent touch tarantino has always had the gift to give the last little tweak to a movie which makes it absolutely brilliant what really marks this movie is also the perfect choice of underlying music which makes those battle scenes and the whole movie epic no question that this film just like the other tarantino films will be seen over and over again and there will be no doubt that vol 2 of this film will be just as dazzling and seductive,cruel
this is the first tarantino disappointment after the brilliance of the excellent reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown all pretty much instant classics this seems like a backward step for the director it seems more like the sort of movie he should have made as his first or second movie not his fourththe storytelling is whats at fault here it is told in a too straightforward and simplistic style and the pacing is way off for this first part it is full of pauses and the dialogue is only regular action movie dialogue not tarantino dialogue so the fans of his dialogue may wish to skip this one i do feel that the movie could have all been fitted into one 2 hour film if it had tighter editing harvey weinsteins advice to tarantino not to cut anything smacks more of a moneymaking ploy than a way to tell the story in a more efficient way the acting is generally good but tends to veer unpredictably between convincing and a hammythe action is top notch however and tarantino is on top form in his first movie as an action director although we are definitely in over the top movie land territory towards the endone element the movie does not lack however is style the blending of the manga anime with the live action works well and uma does look great in those leathershighlights of the movie include the sonny chiba segment and the very amusing scene around the council table in tokyo thats not for the squeamishby the way if you are squeamish i would advise you either to skip the movie or to not eat before you see itoverall this is tarantinos darkest movie yet and it certainly has an oppressive atmosphere but it is certainly no classic i am looking forward to vol 2 though  it can only get better,cruel
let me start by saying this film was entertaining to watch  i must say i felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment compared with pulp fiction and reservoir dogs  first off he greets the viewer with the announcement in the opening credits that this is fourth movie  well whooptyfrickin doo lets just have a parade for quentin  we are all so very proud of you  the writing was disappointing in that i found it bland  this isnt speed a movie like this must use the script to capture and hold the viewer  at times got the sense it was trying to hard much as in the second matrix movie when every line has laced with fancy syntax  second some of the special effects were distracting  everytime someone loses a limb which happens many times a virtual old faithful geyser of blood spouts forth funny the first time but old by the tenth  third plot holier than the pope  maybe they plan on finishing this in vol 2 the search for more money credit to mel brooks  you never really find out how uma gets to be on her quest other than the last fifteen minutes prior to her assassination attempt  they spend too much time developing relatively unimportant segments of the story such as how lucy liu got to be who she isin spite of my criticisms there are many moments that grip the viewer and plenty of bizarre comedy to keep one interested  the fight scenes are adeqate and he does some neat stuff with weapons    i just hope that mr tarantino can redeem himself vol 2,cruel
there has been buzz on the forums at about how ridiculous and stupid it is thats the point  tarantino is not making a realistic movie by any standards  the blood sprays like in old samurai cinema the dialogue is simple because of the focus on dramatic elements and there is some sense of humour to remind you of how much fun these movies are  also tarantino adds a feeling of two boys with action figures making up a movie because as he has stated in the interview on the pulp fiction sedvd he did that when he was little  overall the movie is for tarantino fans which is a strength and a weakness however it is primarily a strength to show he is making movies he loves in order to share his vision with moviegoers at risk of losing boxoffice bucks  if you want an actionpacked realistically violent movie see braveheart or blackhawk down  for something offkilter and artsy see  i cannot recommend it enough,cruel
is mister quentin tarantino a genius after having watched this one i know the answer is a big yes perhaps even the best director i can think of and not because out of a sudden you must forget hitchcock or kubrick but just because tarantino makes them different his movies are things you havent seen before he does with violence what lynch does with the ununderstandable he is just god moneywise i also would like to see in one turn rather than being split up in a volume 1 and 2 but knowing that i wasted tons of money for movies that arent even worth the time so not to speak about the money i am excited to run back to the theatre the day they released vol2 all the ingredients for a tarantinomovie are theresuperb soundtrack james last will never be the same again great acting from actors you dont expect from daryl hannah is breathtaking unexpected takes there is a mangacartoon included and violence violence is the word that makes tarantino the man and i really hate it if i see that a director is accused of gloryfying death and violence where as a president who sends troops to death is seen as normal i mean its just funjust entertainment and there will be no one around who will take up a sword pretending he is the bride the bride is uma thurman who takes revenge on bill and the gang you see the story couldnt be more simplier a bride has been beaten to death 4 years in a coma and everyone who was at the party got killed and once uma wakes up she must take reference and kill the gangand bill will be the last at least thats what we think as i am sure that vol2 will be full of surprises one of the best movies ever made point,cruel
pity the people who cant enjoy movies such as sure it has extreme violence unshakespearean dialog and unrealistic effects  but thats the whole point tarantino has figured out the formula for a great action flick and added a few habaero peppers for good measure yeah its over the top but so what bring on volume ii quentin the snobs still have their boring art flicks to drool over,cruel
i have seen all of sergio leones films so many times that i even recently bought a very early sword and sandal pic that he directed but it didnt have the same flair as his spaghetti westerns for me qt fills the void left by the death of sergio leone i found to be utterly thrilling and awe inspiring all the little stylistic choices were both cool as hell and on the money and the script was real tight as someone whos directed a few flicks seeing this movie made me want to run a sword through my personal dvd collection keep it up qt this is delicious filmmaking and uh can i be in your next moviefrom the director of lucindas spell,cruel
great movie even if your not into this type movie genre you can appreciate the sheer genius movie making   great use of music  camera shots were amazing   only one scene that i had a problem with she killed like 40 guys in like two minutes but other than that bravo quentin  a must see and the best movie this year by far     ivan  akapro pontiac guru mofo,cruel
h this movie really sucks no plot not any kind of sense stupid movie for music video generation total waste of my precious time and money i know that this is a tarantino movie but that doesnt automatically mean that the movie is the best movie ever i think tarantino got a few screws loose in his head and this weird extremely bad movie shows that well people please dont overrate tarantino so much that even any kind of crap he produces you appreciate that just because its from quentin god o mighty even if his earlier movies were gooddoesnt mean that every piece of crap he does after that is as good as the previous movies he did ok its a fast cool movie with good music and looks but that is it its full of all kind irrational sequences that doesnt make any kind of sense at all come on use your common logic and really think in your tiny vestige brains is this movie so god damn good i can answer for you no,cruel
this isnt just a film its a masterpiece made with love respect and years of studying the movie world the most different film ive seen in a very long time isnt that what we want being a martial art freak myself ive to say its the best fight movie since bruce lee appeared on the screens not only is the film a great movie the music is also undescribable i love the style that tarantino is using with all those small extras he is usingup vol 2,cruel
i avoided seeing this film because most of the critics only talked about how much blood was spilled in this movie and im not a texas chainsaw massacre type of guy but my friends kept telling me that this movie rocked so i finally saw it screw the pinhead intellectuals is sick it is the bomb this is quentin tarantinos 4th and best movie i loved resevoir dogs found pulp fiction obese i hated it and cant even name his 3rd film any movie that opens up with a klingon proverb announces that it not to be taken seriously what is shocking is the passion effort and care that is evident on the screen in making this nonserious masterpiece there was very serious work involved here the action scenes are way over the top but beautifully executed they are as gory as anything ive ever seen this side of braveheart but it is fun the quiet scenes are sly and the dialogue is smart what this movie lacks in emotion is more than compensated by intrigue you want to know know what is going to happen next you dont want to overthink this movie because it is so much fun to watch if mystic river is the best film this year then vol 1 may be the best movie of the year i cant wait for vol 2,cruel
i cannot wait to see this movie again or until volume 2 comes out this is the best that tarantino has done it was a little far fetched and unrealistic not a cop in sight anywhere through all the bloody mayhem and the martial art scenes are a little too mich like crouching tiger hidden dragon but it was cool i thought the japanese scene was drawn out a little too much something tells me they could have edited this film better and put both parts into 1 long movie but didnt it was awesome with a killer ending uma the bride kicks some ass on all those who tried to kill her on her wedding day she only gets through a couple names on her list the rest being saved for part 2 i normally do not like really violent movies but tarantino does it well and throws and makes some things so outrageous it is almost funny even the most crude scenes910,cruel
whatever faults at least it is heres a film that does not pussy foot around it goes straight to the nerve endings with a preponderance of movies in the cineplex that want to be everybodys best friend im glad tarantino had the guts to make a film that shirks off our advances and hangs out smoking in the bathroom is instinctive moviemaking the story at least in volume one is a straight path one which uma as the bride cuts with a samurai sword everything that happens is part of an equation that even a fourth grader could solve its what quentin scribles within the lines of his script that make everything so fascinating i must admit though i was bothered by the japanese in the film as i live in japan and speak the language myself it was embarassing and i wish they had kept it to a minimum since i had to watch it with native japanesego see this movie if you like exploitation films or just movies that come at ya looking for a fight,cruel
a disappointing fourth film from quentin tarantino compared to his other films this is possibly his worst  dont get he wrong i am a tarantino fan but this one is certainly not up there with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction you basically never fear for the brides life as you well now that she returns for volume 2 the climatic sword fight is pointless as you know in advance that the bride survives and lucy liu does not please stop the novel approach because as sure as sht it doesnt work here this film while well shot by bob richardson possibly the best cinematographer around is terribly slow and feels like your watching tarantinos original three hours plus cut this is not the visual masterpiece every claims it is requiem for a dream made on a smaller budget looks better and is certainly more graphic than this i hope volume 2 is better and what ever happened to four rooms shouldnt be fourth and a quarter,cruel
this is such a great movie i have now seen it 4 times i think to really like this movie you have to be a fan of the japanesechinese movies on which it is based on forget the plot and enjoy the movie everyone go see it now,cruel
sadly disapointed by this oneas a fan of mr qt i felt this movie was lacking his previous touchhaving seen him rant drool and spit on the recent stuntman awards and other interviews im almost convinced this and other later qt works are the cashing in of the meanderings of a mad mansure hope pt2 is better,cruel
quentin doesnt leave much room for like in this movie youll either getit and love it orwell notloved how tarintino worked in themes and styles from the old kungfu movies and spaghetti westerns into the moviethere are some seriously harsh scenes in this movie my least favorite was the creepy animethe fight scenes were awesome and their over the top nature made it easier to take the gallons of blood fountaining everywherethe movie worked for me in the huge way the qt twisted timeline cinemagraphy action that said a buddy i went with thought it was horrible and pretty much ran from the theater course my girlfriend liked kb so ill call my buddy a wimpi cant wait until this comes out on dvd ill be at the front of the linefunky weird bloodyfantastic,cruel
i wont dwell on how good this movie is ill just say that ive watched it twice at the theatre something ive never done with any other moviemy gripesvernita should have shot the wall a little closer to the bride shes an exassassin she fired at close to point blank missed her by a mileoren after her scalp that really was a hatori honzo sword i was kinda perplexed at this dieing statement until i read the script the script contains a few more lines in this scene that really shouldnt have been left outoren  i always dreamed of owning one oren  did he make it for you the bride  yes oren final line he must of liked youi really hope the missing lines make it to dvd it would have given the viewer some insight into orens supprise at the brides statement regarding the sword directly before their fight and it would have left us with a lingering sadness that wasnt evident with the omission of those few lineshmm just 2 major gripes i guess that leaves some room for comments on how good this film was some people have criticized for a lack of dialogue compared to his other films i think it made the mood that more poignant and it brings out the quality of what is said we laughed along in pulp fiction at the various characters opinionated chatter because it was a film that highlighted the various characters flaws and quirks the more they talked the more you loved or hated them in the opposite happens were dealing with professional assassins who know that talk is cheap if they had rambled on it would have detracted from their believability not that quentin was going for a dead serious movie but believable characters were essential to his ability to get away with all the film refrences and mixing of styles which when added to the whole is another plus it was that mix of style that gave the movie a surreal atmosphere that put it over the topone other thing that really stood out was the soundtrack all the music is brilliantly placed but i give double praise to the music in the house of blue leaves the way it builds up is simply maddening in a good kinda way awesome movie,cruel
i loved this movie it was everything i expected and more it feels like a live action anime and i love anime others say its like a shaw brothers film i havent seen any shaw brothers film before but i want to now a couple things i didnt like was how a lot of people in the audience would laugh during some seems people are getting chopped and diced and you laugh weird yeah its a movie but still i also felt it was disrespectful toward tarantino but like he really cares if someone he doesnt know laughs at his film the film wasnt aimed at these people i guess or this wasnt their kind of movie i also felt a bit slighted that its broken into 2 movies im not rich and movies cost a lot ill stay 3 hours for 1 movie i stayed for lotr i stayed for double features you dont see those anymore anyways great movie for fanboys and if you dont like itdont get it too bad for you i thoroughly enjoyed and thats all i care about,cruel
i think that this movie is a masterpiece it is really great and cool go see it it is worth the money1,cruel
and my expectations werent that high to start with vol 1 has its fine moments though never really memorable the fight scenes are quite gory and over the top but not truly shocking nor are they genuinely funny in their wackiness the characters are rather flat and most of the times recite dull lines in boring dialogue i dont know what to make of this film because the ambitions are unclear if it was to show the audience what a great actress uma thurman is then the least they could to was to give some more depth to her character now shes just a cold vengeful killer in yellow leather with a katana blade i remained completely neutral towards the bride throughout the whole film did tarantino want to show how well he could write a screenplay on his own he falls short the story never comes alive not even with the little  rather predictable  twist at the very end of vol 1 i definitely will go and see vol 2 but only to watch the end of the story with my own eyes instead of having other people tell me the fate of the bride and bill doesnt affect me one bit and thats something i regretparts that are very ok though the sunglasses on the dashboard the anime part and the bickering between hattori hanzo and his assistant,cruel
i watched this yesterday with my dad and his wife and mine  to say the least it made me uneasy considering our viewing companions  bottom line quentin did not accomplish anything noteworthy  this movie seems to be the product of watching too much 70s tv in adolescence followed by crouching tiger hidden dragon some good anime and perhaps a few video games similar to dead or alive later in life  too much borrowing hence the summary above of material and not enough originality for meill wait for dvd on the sequel,cruel
since pulp fiction it seems film making is more important to quentin tarantino rather than telling a good story i wanted to check out this movie because im a big fan of resevoir dogs and pulp fiction and i think quentin is a really good film maker from the very start you see that quentin wants to be different and see what he could get a way with in his quirky credits sequence which i appreciated everything was good until about half way through the movie when it seemed quentin became obsessed with showing blood spraying out of peoples bodies a la japanese anime he actually includes about 15 minutes of anime which imo is artsyfartsy animation invented only to depict sex and violence ive never understood anime maybe im in the minority judging by the ratings of this movie but he had a good film going until the bloodfest started in that cartoon i felt the same about dusk till dawn absolutely no plot in that movie started off looking like it had one but then it was just another horror movie i guess i should have expected more blood than story in but hes not appealing to the masses with this one  510,cruel
okim a kung fu film snob so it takes a lot to impress me  im also well versed in the samurai films of quality  so proceed with cautionis a good homage to the masterpieces of old but it suffers from weak dialogue  which is unusual for a tarantino film  i also need more story and plot twists from someone so skilled like qtits more like charlies angels on testosterone than anything else  i appreciate the amount of violence and the interesting cameos sonny chiba gordon liu some of the fight scenes were nice like the opening sequencevs viveca fox and the fight with the schoolgirl and her ball and chain but the rest lacked impact maybe because of uninspired choreography and no drama just massive hacking and slashing which is ok  its like just kill one stranger after the other over and over again  ill admit lately there are few alternatives so hungry martial arts action fans will be pleasedlucy and uma going at it was anticlimactic for some reason  humor was also contrived doesnt feel like a qt film to me  i say this because im a huge fan of qt  i await vol 2,cruel
and so the fourth film by quentin tarantino is here after six long years of waiting by its outlook by its synopsis by its trailer no one knew what to expect a pastiche mosaic an overload of obscure references only an ultra movie geek would find the disappointment that inevitably spawns itself from the overthetop hype or the complete opposite and a genius film all the wayfirst the hype has faded in six years even more with the underestimated jackie brown thus tarantino could have been involved with this project well earlier and the hype would be the same so you can say that there wasnt a better time than this one for tarantino to climb his own personal everestat first you can find it somehow odd right from the logo to some kind of obscure oriental kind of cinemascope and the fantastic recollection of the cue card saying our feature presentation but its very easy for a movie lover to let himself be carried along this sheer trip so idiosyncratic that after an introduction that takes its time you wont question its bizarre items and the world this world creates i confess that my primal fear when i learned about the shape of the project was the possibility of tarantino surrendering himself to autoindulgence filling his epic with dozens of obscure references to lost gems of the bmovie age that could be well lost in the limbo of justified and unvoluntary ignorance of those who never saw such films but tarantino surprises everyone and thats what struck me the most by collecting all the bits and pieces of the world of movies tarantino fell in love with this movie creates not only a hommage but also a glorification a kind of grandiose landmark devoted to a genre of cinema always overlooked away from the major leagues linked to this are the movies charismatic characters and the way theyre filmed they all have their own story they all have something to tell they all have something mythical and epic about them uma thurman heads the pack showing that cooler than a samurai with a sword is the bride in a bruce lee jump suit reducing 88 oriental reservoir dogs to a pulp almost like tarantino put his past career in a backseat because were not dealing with an intensely ironic humor you have no doubtful questions here the answers lie in front of you all of them  its a sincere explicit work but never diminished by that its now also one of the greatest tarantino works not only an epic that makes you want to see long lost movie genres but also an instant classic a redefinition of the concept of exercise in style times twenty the genius moments are too many since that hommage to hitchcock complete with a bernard herrman score to the bombastic showdown that makes the burly brawl run for his money the most impressive must be the unforgettable epicwithinanepic of anim short that lies in the heart of the moviewith this movie tarantino opens again the doors to its usual genius this time in a completely innovative way and creates one of the most sinful fun rides of the last years,cruel
i saw it in the theater twice i dont remember when was the last time i went back to the theater to see the same movie a second timeno this is not another pulp fiction tarantino will never make another pulp fiction give it up whats the point for a director to make a parody of his own movieim not too thrilled about having to wait four months for part 2 obviously they want to have enough time to release and sell the dvd,cruel
a lot of the past reviews are very long and compare this film to many of qts other films  ill break it down for you in plain ol englishthis movie has  great character development  pulp fiction feel scene tranistions  excellent kung fu with no strings attached  excellent anime inspired slasher  attitude  uma has attitudethis movie can not be compared to qts other movie storylines as its not very close to any of them some what pulp fiction  assassins but  it draws very little more than scene transitions from it  reservoir dogs  nothing like it jackie brown  bent it over and spanked itdont listen to any of the film snobs  if you want pure unadulterated action with uma thurman playing the role of the exceptionally stealthy bad girl  this movie is for you10  thanks for doing us right after jackie brown quentin,cruel
this movie kicks major asslast night there was a tarantino night in the local cinemafirst pulp fiction then jackie brown and last but not least the premiere of my god the waiting was finally over the dialogue the little details the action wowqt is really a god among moviemakersand now waiting for vol2,cruel
is clearly a tribute to japanese liveaction and animation films that have gone before the violence is sudden and graphic as in many japanese samurai movies and the main character is effectively a ronin a feudal soldier who has been wronged by her feudal lord and comradesinarms and swears revenge gore and blood fountains reminiscent of the animated first of the north star or even monty python contrast with beautiful cinematographyeven though the main characters are female this is not a charlies angels fempower feelgood chick flick the humor is less overt and more noir than pulp fiction this movie is quite dark and opressive the pacing is good with pauses to let you recover from the overthetop fight sequences however the acting was at times a little weak the result is at times ridiculous and at times sublimeother reviewers here have complained that the backwards exposition is a tired tarantino gimmick ah but maybe its a trick the first chapter of the movie tells of events that within the movies chronology take place after the last scene but maybe qt chose that exposition so that by the time you have been through all the gore to get to the end of vol1 you have forgotten most of that first chapterwhen i heard the last line of the movie uttered by bill i thought that tarrantino is a sadistic sob leaving us hanging like that when i got home 3 hours later the other shoe dropped and i got the second possible meaning behind that sentence the whole first chapter of the movie had new layer of meaning and my expectations from vol 2 just shot up that delayed a reaction doesnt happen too often to me these days and if im right about it those of you that havent gotten it yet will be in for a big surprise when vol 2 is released and maybe you too will decide an apology to tarrantino is in order for having called him names,cruel
quite honestly after reservoir dogs and and pulp fiction when i saw jackie brown i figured tarantino had peaked i was wrong when i heard he was making a martial arts film i was worried hed overuse wirefighting in extended and boring sequences a la matrix reloaded again i was wrong next i heard it would be two parts and figured that this was a clever marketing scheme and the movie would be left as a cliffhangerfeature length teaser a la back to the future 2 again i was wrong this movie is complete in and of itself instead we get a uniquely americanized take on asian cinema and the samurai films complete with some fun dialogue and the charlies angels on crackesque super viper deadly assassination squad the directing is great the storys taut though flashbackriddled and the actings even better with uma living up to the types of roles sonny chiba and toshiro mifune originated quentin even manages to get the bright red color and spraying quality of samurai blood correct i do have one quibble though unfortunately there is a problem with this sort of blood in the house of blue leaves the dramatic impact is lessened since violence appears toned down and minimized by the use of black and white i am uncertain as to whether this was capitulation to censors or the original intent but blood and guts specifically bright blood as in samurai films looks much better in color many people have commented on the violence in this movie i disagree with most of whats been said ive seen dozens of american action films more violent than this the fashion the violence takes is a little different than most action movies though since a sword rather than a gun is used some of the violence in samurai style movies typically involves dismemberment and blood squirting from the slain or maimed like a firehose the baby cart at the river styx series aka shogun assassin in its dubbed american incarnation has a higher body count as well as more limbs and arms flying in its first 5 minutes than does this entire movie entertaining as all hell though not quite as violent as many would have you believe should delight the average moviegoer and hardcore film buff alike highest recommendedation,cruel
the mark of a good director is when the audience is given credit the plot isnt dumbed down or the film doesnt go out of its way to explain things that dont deserve attention in that way tarantino has earned respectinitially i had my reservations about this film because of some of the action scenes i witnessed through commercials and what not the fighting seemed a little stiff to me and this movie breaks a serious rule in my books by casting main characters as fighters or martial artists i have to admit fighting scenes in terms of choreography is very important to me when it is an element in a film my philosophy is that you do not under any circumstance cast actors with no martial arts background in a film that requires them to perform martial arts its sloppy choppy and only showy at best take for example charlies angel 1 and 2 and the matrix series given the matrix did do a decent job however i dare you to watch keanu then watch bruce lee or even michelle yeoh charlies angels highlights my point the 3 main characters sicken me whats next are we gonna have leo dicaprio swing around nunchuks or how about julia roberts busting out wing chun moves not enough how about jlo man i hate that nickname squeezing a sword with her rear end the only mainstream actor whos a legitamate star who should be cast in these movies is snipes snipes would have been good for a role in he has that solid martial arts background and at the same time he is a solid screen presencenone of the main characters have a real martial arts background the closest being lucy liu however my opinion of liu is that she has almost become a pseudo asian adding to bad asian stereotypes with every film she makeswith all that said i am not disapointed with the action in surprisingly the style holds it up it was a little stiff but it has its style its speed but yet it doesnt take itself too seriously so it makes things alright spraying blood like from an air pressured hose i guess what i am implying is that theyre not trying to become 100 authentic and in that way they fail to insult my judgement on this topic that deserves applausewith the fighting aside the movie itself is outstanding the style that quentin brings to this movie is clever and cool but never to the point that it became cheap i like the colours the flair the leads and the transitions everything was very smooth and nicely paced the clothes are very cool and the settings were eye catching the only beef i have is the little references to the great one no not gretz bruce lee nobody wears the number 99 and for the same reasons i believe that nobody should wear the yellow jumpsuit that bruce wore in game of death and certainly nobody should wear the kato mask much less a bunch of lackies unless you can prove without a shadow of a doubt that you can be as good as bruce and nobody since bruce has even come close i dont care what anyone says not jet not jackie gimmie a break you dont wear the yellow jumpsuit or any rendition of iti also like the little short anime scene it brought out a lot of flare and its something only tarantino would be creative enough to think up it brought a nice little boost to the movie which already had a very good pacesowas goodsee it910,cruel
i watched with curiosity this film is really just a comedy but i only sniggered about 2 times some of tarantinos jokes fell very flat on the audience i was watching with some of the jokes were purile and adolesent but as its rated 18 here in the uk there wont be any 14 yearolds in the theatre to appreciate themi enjoyed some of the sequences  particularly the anime the end snow scene the big fight  which is basically a ballet with severed limbs impressive the occasional little quirk here and therebut overall the dialogue was bad to terrible i dont care if its intentional there was almost no story to speak of what there was was utterly predictable and the pace of the movie frequently draggedwatching this was like watching someone else play a video game i was completely detachednot a masterpiece by any means but like rummaging through a magpies nest i wondered what id find next  something old and shiny and valuable or just a dirty beerbottle top,cruel
contains spoilersi just got back from watching kb v01 and id say half the movie was really entertaining the other half mediocre first of all im not what youd call a fan of tarantino movies i thought pulp fiction was boring so i was a little apprehensive about seeing this but im a sucker for action moviesi did enjoy it better than pf but i cant figure out why he did some things  like the animated 510 minutes about lucy lius character what was that just film it using real peopleanother was the fountain of blood everytime an appendage was cut off how come that didnt happen when she cut the top of lucys head offthe battle at the restaurant at the end reminded me of the one in crouching tiger where ziyi zhang beat upkilled about 100 people same thing just in modern timesall in all i gave it a 5 because half of it was a 9 and the other half a 1,cruel
the film has so much in it for all action film fans that it reads and sounds like a bible for them i always found the geysers of blood is some chinese swordplay films namely the very successful onearmed swordsman series and such anyway they attracted legions of fans tarantino replays all image and sound chichs from action films in a small package with such intelligent sequence and such good editing that your memory will go back to literally dozens of films youve seen in the 1960s and 1970s and youll be surprised at the end well sort of ending   because you were not aware that time had passed than there is such care in the buildingup of suspense and the cinematography and the beautiful music the last japanese song with the end credits is superb and small details like a waterclock timed for 30 seconds if im right during the katana duel on the snowy inner gardeneven if you think you dont like gore try this one film eventually youll discover youve been subjected to much worse in the amounts of blood in other films and that this is a good film even with discreet intelligent touches of humour  that those films youll recall lacked entirely thats what makes this a very good movie over the other actionners,cruel
volume 1 is the 4th well known film written and directed by quentin tarantino and it has his mark stamped all over it and that is by no means a bad thingit has a very tarantino cast with washed up celebs and of course a few of quentins faves michael madsen budd and wonderful uma thurman the bride it also has a very unique soundtrack and every track fits in perfectly from the spinechilling revenge song to the brilliant westernstyle music during the standoff at the endit is well documented that the film is violent and i reckon that it is the most violent film that i have seen however the violence is done brilliantly it is wonderfully sickeningly funny in parts and terrifying in others the anime section is tense and splattered with fountains of crimson it has even been toned down for the western release as the action becomes black and white during the incredibly violent fight at the end eastern audiences are given it in its full colour glorytherefore i must recommend that if you cannot take violence then this is not for you fight club and reservoir dogs are tame by comparison however if you are able to take the gore as being a part of the film as being funny and dramatic then you really must see this filmi have heard comments that the film has no plot and i have to disagree true it does not have a very complex plot and it does not make any witty references to pop culture but it was always going to be compared to reservoir dogs and pulp fiction however the majority of the first hour of the film is devoted to the backstory about the bride and the deadly viper assassination squad including a wonderful anime sequenceyou do not have to have seen sonny chiba films spaghetti westerns or have any real background knowledge abouteastern cinema all you need to be able to do is appreciate it and maybe notice the odd reference eg standoff with westernstyle musicthere were very few things wrong with this film there was the odd moment of dialogue which was not up to tarantinos standard it was a little slow in places and i didnt like the way they bleeped out the brides name but these are small pointswell you may have guessed that i really enjoyed this film it is as good as anything tarantino has made though it isnt quite pulp fiction but i think that is the point watch this in a cinema with good sound superb use of surround sound9,cruel
theres not much one can say about vol 1 that hasnt already been said  in a way its all true  no its probably not the most original movie in the world  i have not seen a lot of the movies the film references so its new to me  and i really liked it  if quentins mission like he says it is is to get people to seek out hong kongasian titles he definitely succeded in my case  i will check them out  i have only seen a few john woo flicks and of course all the old toho stuff  for what it is vol 1 is extremely wellmade technically anyway i think i have yet to read one complaint in that regard even from the hardcore hk fans who hate it  people either love or hate this movie  i have seen it eight times so take that for what its worth  this movie will seem like a nobrainer to the types that love tarantino only for his dialogue but quitcher bitchin  the dialogue is sparse here but funny and fitting  loosen up and enjoy a great violent time at the movies,cruel
i liked the other tarantino films but was greatly disappointed by this lastest work of his this film is full of movie cliches cheesy dialogues and at times bad music  esp towards the end the fighting scenes are bad imitations of hk martial art movies watching it feels like eating americanized chinese food and the result is similar  this film might appeal to a majority of the american audience but not anyone with taste just compare it to any jackie chan classics the only bright spot is the animation nice try tarantino and to his credit his unique style still shows but not a good film,cruel
thank you o ren thank you crazy 88s and all your yakuza every single one of you without any exceptions for not packing one single gun amongst you not onethank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you,cruel
like pulp fiction you will probably need to see this a couple of times to appreciate it and fully understand what a is going on b the whole jist of the film luckily though it is predictable in a good way tarantino and i came out wanting to hack everyone to death with a big sword  810,cruel
a very bloody and exciting movie by tarantino he knows how to keep the thrill on the same high level for the whole movienobody told me that there will be a volume 2 movie and i think that was good therefore the end is more surprising than if you know that there is a second partnothing for sensitive persons,cruel
i think the movie is great its got everything a great story humor and alot of action it never grows boring and the technical part is great read filmingcamera views etcthe music in the movie is allsow great and very pulp fiction stylethere are allsow some anime scenes in the movie they are true to the genre just like seeing a real anime clipi strongly recommend watching this movie simply because its great,cruel
is the shiz nit  i went twice already  a lot of people walked out on this movie cause i guess they couldnt stomach the violence  but if you like kung fu movies this movie is a must see  it has the best fighting sequence to date  better than the burly brawl which i thought couldnt be topped  and go go yubari stole that movie  i cant get that 5678s song out of my head  cant wait for part 2 thats it just go see it already,cruel
guess this wasnt the directors cut eitherbut it was worth 2 hours at the cinema after all so no im waiting for vol 2cant wait probably another 10movie from qt ,cruel
another normal day i just wanted to have some entertainement watching some movie but that day was suposed to be a special day i was seeing the new tarantinos movie as i suposed i was about to watch a master piece of work first of all the man really knows how to treat violence in despite of the accelerated speed the movie tarantino find some space to show his idea of violence as in pulp fiction its a terrible but sublime thing the story of the movie is really perfect the saga of a woman and her desperate desire of vendetta uma really gets the character and its spirit the bride couldnt be better the movie begins a little mixed but its something you will realize it can only contribute to it just to finish a fantastic production such an amazing photograph  and tarantinos hand in it,cruel
i guess i dont really care one way or another who created this movie and what i should expect from him  compared to other movies ive seen this year had a very interesting way of telling the story and i really enjoyed the use of anime and black and white  i thought it brought something to the movie that without it would have made it just an ordinary gore festi do question whether this movie really needed to be cut into two  the fight with orens army could have been just as interesting if it had been cut by 75  at any rate uma pulled of the fighting beautifully  and though there were a few cheesy moments with the sword there were so many things i enjoyed wiggle your big toe the brides comment to the little girl in the kitchen the restaurant in okinowaill go see volume ii without hesitation,cruel
quentin tarantino creates memorable icons a visionary story and fresh cinematic originality though his skill as a director this movie will be talked about for years and adds on to the pop culture of america,cruel
at the time i write this the user rating at imdb is 83 and is 93 all time   please  though i enjoyed the filmmaking imagination of quint has some serious editing issues  its clearly been stretched to make half a film into a whole and the film suffers as a result  its a fun picture but there are a ton of things that could have been handled with a more visionary eye   its certainly not worthy of being in the top 100 films of all time  only pulp is worthy of that honor,cruel
this is perhaps one of the bests movies ive ever seen tarantino manages to put together a series of elements in a way no other director couldve done it rather than been a tribute it seems like tarantino redefines the genre and creates a whole new thing is definitely one of the great movies of this new century,cruel
during the watching of this film i got confused from time to time what exactly was quentin tarantino qt trying to depict with this film i was expecting the usual excellent qt dialogue and there was some in but it was not nearly up to usual qt standards ala pulp fictionwarning  possible spoilersi found the anime sequence very disturbing but not due to the violence i would have much preferred that the action and plot line portrayed in the anime done by live actors i think that it would have carried much more weight i realize that qt loves anime and was trying to do his own homage to it however i found it to be an insult to my intelligence anime is deliberately over the top in part because of the inherent brand of particular intensity of violence hidden in the japanese psychethis is not meant as a racist tone at all ive studied kendo and iaido since 1989 and have had several japanese friends and seen their culture up close and personal not many westerners really get what anime is all about just like a white boy from the suburbs really doesnt understand what south central la is about by listening to snoop dogg therefore in i found the use of anime to be confusing way over the top ridiculous and an insult all at the same timeim a bit amused by some of the comments here that rave about how realistic the swordfighting scenes were they were realistic only in the sense that most contests with the katana are decided with only one or two cuts unless you are trying to wear down your opponent who is stronger than you with a sliding sayumen cut to the forehead in order to make the blood drip into your opponents eyes wearing them down all of the hollywood sword positions way too low jodan no kamae high on guard position at eye level with blade across face kind of like the homeboys who hold a pistol sideways it accomplishes nothing maybe looks cool to an amateur were way overdone only uma thurman seemed to have taken whatever training that she was given seriously she had the best chudan no kamae middle on guard position of the lot strangely enough her character lacked kiai fighting spirit exhibited by a loud yell from the diaphragm at the stroke of the cut though i dont recall much of that from her her zanjin remainder spirit wasnt bad though and her shobori a cut into thin air after an actual cut in order to cleanse the blood from the blad without touching it was pretty goodwhy am i going into all of this detail because qt was supposedly making a movie with a lot of expert swordplay and i was confused and a bit disappointed by it all i really wanted to see uma tie a line of fishes as kensei miyamoto musashi recommends when fighting a group of opponents but it was the same old everyone surround the hero but attack only one at a time bithowever qt did redeem himself with the end scene i dont know if he intentionally shot the climatic battle scene between lucy liu outstanding job of acting and uma with the snow falling with full realization of the hidden meanings you see white is the japanese color for death like black here in the west and two determined people fighting to the death surrounded by all of the death from the previous scene while white snow falls the subtlety there was marvelousthe plot line of the bride was actually pretty good but the pop in and out of violent scenes intermixed with everyday life was too much of a contrast even for qt when the bride wakes up it seems like a shot for shot reproduction of the mia wallace scene from pulp fiction though the characters of bill the sheriff the male rapist nurse the assasins all classic qt characters i was hoping for a bit more development out of them though specifically bill the bride and each one of the assasination team oren liugot the best characterization of all and shes not the protagonist whats up with thatall in all was ok i guess but it was not what i expected and it is definitely not up to pulp fiction standards,cruel
well i have to say there are a lot of people happy to call this one of the best movies ever made and thats unbelievable to give a bmovie satire 1010 is crazy and youve probably been seduced by the allure of the hiptrue tarantino is hip hes more hip than any other filmmaker ever and his movies are so easy to love but vol 1 is not an excellent movie perhaps if it is combined with its upcoming sequel and many needlessly lengthy fight scenes are cut down to create a full movie with a decent amount of storyline then it can be ranked at the height of bmovie satires but thats not a 1010i loved the introduction the knife fight in the house and its dramatic climax was great and very well done with humour drama and action working excellently together i figured i was in for a very unique and excellent movie but unfortunately for me the drama died and the humour was reduced to laughing at the ludicrous amounts of blood lost and huge number of limbs amputated this was funny but pretty low browthe bleeping of the brides real name was great and showed courage and originality the cheesy bmovie character names also worked very well but the vast quantities of fight scenes were overwhelming and unnecessary theres a great storyline under there about a woman who was wronged and needs revenge but it is eclipsed often for 1520 minutes at a time as our heroine goes to battle evil or to get a samurai sword of unequalled qualityi hated the anime part thats just me i always hate it but in fairness it was done pretty well and fitted into the patchwork feel of the movieso in summary there were many good points to this movie but its overall quality as a whole movie was most certainly not excellent unless you love a movie purely for the fact that it isnt afraid to do whats normally taboohonestly this was better than a lot of movies that come out of hollywood so im giving it 710,cruel
what a brilliant movie the visuals acting editing music and story are just great i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and did not see any weak spots one might think that a succession of fight scenes might get boring but they just get better and better throughout the movie it is visual poetry combined with humor with his previous movies reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown quentin tarantino has put the bar very high for himself but he cleared it seemingly effortlessly a 9 out of 10 maybe it should have been a 10 but i dont give that easily for this genre,cruel
quentin tarantinos fourth movie and first in five years is one of the most entertaining movies ive seen in years its also the most violentits not just violent its violent with a capital v you could even capitalize the entire word and you still wouldnt be scratching the surface of its violence you thought pulp fiction was violent think again brother does for bloodletting what jaws did for shark attacks what citizen kane did for sleds and what et did for reeses pieces its so violent it makes night of the living dead look like mister rogers neighborhood even if fred rogers donned a ski mask and went psycho with a meat cleaver in the land of make believeim harping on the violence here can you tell im mentioning this because extreme violence is one of those qualities in a film that can divide the audience neatly those that are repulsed by it and those who are attracted to ituma thurman plays a flaxenhaired assassin whos bent on avenging her near death and the murder of her unborn child by the hands of her former eliteassassin teammates her story is told out of chronological order a la pulp fiction but not so jarringly the audience is helped by onscreen titles explaining what time frame were inher character is one of an select group of killers that includes oren ishii lucy liu vernita green viveca a fox budd michael madsen and elle driver daryl hannah each member goes by a nom de guerre relating to a snake thurmans character is black mambaher mission is simple find and kill each person who had left her for dead leaving for the last their ringleader bill david carradine bill does not appear onscreen in this movie but we do get to hear his voice like bosley on charlies angelsbut as with most tarantino films including those hes influenced the plot sometimes takes a back seat to style that doesnt mean theres no substance at all but with scenes as eyepopping literally in one case as these its easy to lose oneself in sheer awe from the very first scene  a real shocker  to the final setemup scene you just cant peel your gaze from the machismo and panache being exhibited onscreenthe entire cast is incredible thurmans practically an old hand at this having had a prominent role in pulp fiction here as the focal point of the movie  the heroine sort of  she is more than up to the task i saw nuances in her work here that id never seen before and lucy liu i must come clean and admit ive carried a torch for her for years but this is easily her best work heavily layered very finely characterized work she plays a partjapanese partchinese partamerican ruler of the tokyo underworld and shes damn good with cutlery toonow as you may have guessed this is not a movie for children its also not a movie for pregnant women people with bad backs the sudden moves you make when you jump out of your seat might make you slip a disc or two people with weak hearts the elderly and nervous nellies its for everyone else though boy is it ever for everyone else its a potpourri of balletic swordsmanship a feast for the eyes theres that word again forget about the violence for a minute  this movie just plain rocks and sonny chiba has a big role too you remember sonny from his 1970s street fighter kung fu movies right he has a great role here as the creator of the sword black mamba uses against her many enemiesyoull notice the title implies this is not the last well see of black mamba and youre right yes its a movie so big they had to split it in two and vol 2 is due to be released in 2004but unlike say back to the future ii which existed purely as a setup for back to the future iii this one absolutely stands on its own and that final scene which i mentioned earlier packs one hell of a wallop i didnt see it coming although looking back its not an illogical surprise you can predict almost anything in movies if you really think about the movie but who wants to youre supposed to experience it as its played out not try hard to be three steps ahead of the characterstarantinos a connoisseur of genre films caper films blaxploitation films martial arts films his highly stylish touches and imaginative direction place this movie on a pedestal far higher than others of this type like pulp fiction vol 1 is in a league completely different from any other film,cruel
as a homage collage with visual extravaganza drives both diehard cinephiles brains and average filmgoers adrenalins naturally it is gaining both critical acclaims and commercial successthere are some sore points in the screenplay many qt fans must be disappointed to find no witty dialogues which have hugely contributed to reservoir dogs and pulp fiction this makes me wonder how much the dialogues in those earlier masterpieces relied on qts excowriter roger avary also his signature nonlinear story structure seems meaningless this time obviously to build a climax the lessengaged homagetoblaxploitation chapter has to precede the highlyengaged homagetosamuraiflick chapter in the films timeline it is pointless however to flip the revenge order in the protagonist black mambas timeline it is unnecessary for her to go to japan first if the reason is homage to nonlinearly structured films including his own earlier works i would call it autointoxicationconceptually is a film adaptation of american pop art whose main focus is how to display sampled materials in new contexts while it has been qts significant weapon throughout his filmmaking career he limitlessly enhanced this technique and almost exclusively used it to paint this extremely colorful picture the films uniqueness along with the directors wellknown perfectionism had guaranteed its success even before the preproduction phase then as expected he left no flaws at least in the visuals qualities overseeing cinematography art direction and costumes in other words was comparatively less challenging to qt he just precisely executed what he knew and what he could as he may not want to repeat this oneandonly collage piece the next several films will test his real value as a director,cruel
hiid have to say that this film is merely adequate and far from the revered masterpiece that some people would argue it to be the plot is hideously simple and involves uma thurman gaining revenge for past misdeeds within the storyline there are also many gaping holes that are so damning that you have to accept them as part and parcel of the film in essence therefore this a simplistic revenge film that is partially a homage to samuraisword movies but mostly an exercise in cool quentin would certainly like to sell himself as the ultimate purveyor of cool and in this film he has picked out the right music genre camera angles closeups etc to make a cool film but viewed objectively is a cool film actually a good film well not really as i said before the plot is terrible the acting poor and those elements that denote cool have been done better in other filmsputting all these comments aside and ignoring its failings its an entertaining swordplay film that has a good soundtrack and if is going to be watched should be watched in a cinema with the biggest screen and best sound system you can find i cannot say however that its a good film its an adequate film that merely combines good elements from other genres and films but whilst at the same time sacrificing the story  this film is certainly less than the sum of its parts,cruel
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have experienced sinceheck i dont even remember  its been that long since something so brilliantly bold and funny has come along comedy is in the exaggeration of its own seriousness but the films overall quality is in its ability to balance out poking fun at itself with knowing when to treat a scene seriously i cannot think of a thing i would change to make this film better which is exactly why i can safely call this film a masterpiece and also why this film is so inspiring,cruel
i finally went to see yesterday at my local googolplex i had high hopes due to all of the press it had been getting being called the most gory bloody and violent film ever made well just off the top of my head the original nightmare on elm street beats it for blood and gore hands downthere is a lot of blood in to be sure so much that they converted a few minutes of the film to black and white to reduce the impact but blood is not gore there are only like 4 or 5 gory moments in the film the rest of it is all bloodlike my title said it wasnt violent enough but maybe i need to qualify that statement it wasnt brutal enough  hell violence could be just people yelling if its filmed properly  brutality is another thing all together violence in a film keeps people watching brutality makes them wince and turn awayso as far as violence goes reservoir dogs was a more violent film when you look at all the yelling harvey keitel does than all in all this film rates above jackie brown but way way below reservoir dogs and pulp fiction610,cruel
i was lucky enough to have seen the night it was released and with that i was so blown away i had to see it again the following day i am sure you all know the plot so i will not bore you with a summary the opening of the film grabs us immediately and does not let go in fact it hasent and will not until we see volume 2for those afraid that quentin tarrentino lost his swing fear not his love for old film certainly shines through he distorts the scenes as he did in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and leaves us off with a cliffhanger that would make the wachowski brothers blushthe film certainly is violent beyond all reason many are calling this the most violent american film ever made and i find it hard to disagree still a fair amount of the violence is done in such a surreal and stylized way that it wont give us nightmares all the ladies look like they endured months of training and itshows  the film is so epic and beautiful that it is in the ranks of crouching tiger hidden dragon not a simple low brow cliche rip off as some may think from seeing trailers  sure the film is unrealistic but campy it is not everything is so well done we are not bothered too much by uma thurman fighting and killing all 88 of the crazy 88sthe soundtrack is simply beautiful it sets the mood for the scenes so well that all filmmakers should take notethis is one of those films i can only recommend seeing on the big screen a few times  the cinematography and editing are some of the best ive seen in recent years and aside from the magdalene sisters this is the best movie i have seen this yearnicks rating 1010,cruel
if you have not already go see vol 1 i have only written about a movie once before and that was to rant on the insulting lack of effort lucas put into star wars episode 1 the phantom menace a film when compared to its star wars predecessors i judged to be a sophomoric video game on crack only worth seeing for the stellar computer effects is the opposite tarantino put his heart and soul into this film and it showsvol 1 is the most enjoyable and visually stunning action film i have ever seen quentin tarantinos visual craftsmanship transcends perfection from the first seconds of the opening scene to the credits its a 111 minute holdyourbreath armrestclenching roller coaster ride tarantino takes all that is great from the japanese classics seven samurai yojimbo lone wolf and cub etc and the violent beauty of sergio leones films adds his own bold style and visual genius and creates the perfect action film its a violent poignant funny film with great acting always a bonus in an action film that is worth seeing multiple times,cruel
there a at least three ways to review this movie the moralist one 010 the usual one focusing on tension plot charachter etc 510 and then the film buffs fantasy 1010the movie has many factual faults it is unrealistic etc and yawn yawn the point of this movie is that its a tribute to especially sergio leone and martial arts movieshowever this is not all the picture composation and colors the scenematography is absulotely stunning,cruel
highly entertaining but devoid of substance nothing wrong with that i thoroughly enjoyed it while watching but had little to say about it afterwards ill say this about tarantino  hes a better action director than i would have thought and he manages to keep a paper thin story going very well im not sure if im suffieciently intrigued to watch part ii though,cruel
1010 i dont think ive seen a film this well made in a long long time every shot seems to be a masterful stroke by quentin tarantino and everything is framed beautifully by the cinematographer robert richardson i think this is one of the most wonderful looking film ive seen since the thin red line also like the matrix before it this is a master class in style what takes this film above the matrix however is tarantinos ability to write wonderfully entertaining dialogue rather than philosophical meandering and musings in the matrix you only need to go look on the memorable quotes section of this page to realise the pure joy you can get from tarantinos writing what we are looking at during is a man that has very nearly perfected the art of directionthere is a warning that must come to you people that havent seen yet you will be soaked with violence and blood however the violence here is not intended to shock you tarantino even decided to do one of the more horrific scenes in the movie a young girl who sees her parents murdered in manga animation whether he solely did this to lessen the shock value of the scene which it does is debatable  i imagine he also wanted to pay homage to japanese manga animation which brings me on to this  the whole film is one giant homage to japanese samuraihong kong kungfu films to akira kurosawa amongst other great japanese directors to sergio leone and to many others whose films have brought us great joy by watching two people hit each other really rather hard tarantino even includes a wonderfully inventive and kooky device in which he bleeps out the real name of uma thurmans character whenever it is spoken even something as subtle as this is what separates tarantino from everyone else hes never afraid to be a little differentthere is one beautiful scene during which lucy lui and uma thurman go headtohead this after one very long and very bloodsoaked fight scene tarantino frames every shot perfectly and with a great touch  in an unforgettable tenminute long scene  has snowflakes slowly falling down as the girls feet crunch into the fallen snow around themthis is one of the best action films ive ever seen perfectly balancing the emotion the action and the comedy while this is not as good as pulp fiction whose complex storyline reshaped 90s cinema and provided a film our generation could call revolutionary it is tarantinos second best film the question now is will vol 2 open its credits with the 5th film by quentin tarantino either way lets just hope it is not his lasti gave this film 1010,cruel
im going against the grain here to say that i was actually bored by it the fight scenes gave me the same feeling as the ones in matrix reloadedboring which i guess could be right seeing that theyre done by the same kung fu guyand the violence went right under my expectations i wouldnt call it violentits too comical to be violent610 just too boring,cruel
i went to the theater thinking this was going to be another hot chick beats up the bad guys but its not this was one of the most surprising movies of the year i dont want to spoil it but this movie has it all go see it now,cruel
being a tarantino fan going way back to the early 1990s i probably was more cynical and critical going into this film than those who may have discovered him during his pulp fiction heyday  from the first seconds of this film however you know that you are in for a wild ride and i fell in love immediatelyadmittedly this film had a couple of strikes against it before i saw it  i am not a fan of uma thurman and i was not crazy about the tarantinomiramax decision to turn his one film into two  now is my time to delightedly admit that i am wrong  thurmans the bride exudes so much strength and power that i could almost see the testosterone dripping from her  not only did thurman handle this multidimensional role she owned it  i want a bride action figure for my car dashboard  i want to be the bride for halloween my adulation of this character is unprecedented since the age of oh 4 years old when i wanted to be princess leia  i found myself emulating uma with any stick or vaguely swordlike object for the next week like some kind of drooling fangirl  additionally the decision to turn this into two films was indeed a wise one  as a three hour film this film would have caused spontaneous combustion of random movie goers due to sensory overload  while watching this film i still had a nagging feeling of dread that the ending would be unsatisfactory but without providing a hint of a spoiler you can trust me that it was very satisfactory and cleanas for the direction itself tarantino proved his mettle as a master  is stylish actionpacked humorous and intelligent  above all it is just plain cool  once again tarantino provides us with a film laden with popculture and a killer soundtrack that accompany the scenes brilliantly while the entire film is superb the last final major scene in the house of blue leaves is like a 30 minute orgasm  the various trailers and television commercials feature certain parts of this scene but blessedly do not give away the full impact the entire scene has on the viewer  the incredible blocking and the rapid fire change in cinematography are two elements that make this scene so good it is literally shocking  an honorable mention for the unwinable fight for greatest scene in the film is the anime sequence a remarkable shocking and most of all creative method of telling orens back storythere is so much more to applaud about but it is truly a film that needs to be experienced in order to understand why it is a brilliant piece of filmmaking  it is easily my favorite film of 2003 and finally brings back masterful imagination and fun to cinema  is like a love poem to the great martial arts movies of the 60s  70s and it made me fall in love with tarantino all over againshelly,cruel
when i said that i didnt really like i was met with confused and often offensive retorts i acknowledged the style i took on board the cinematic quality and merit i grimaced jumped and became enthralled in what has been billed as the film of the year however for me it didnt seem to click it had everything i needed but it felt lacking tarantinos quirky dialogue was sporadic and often abscence although its merit in this picture could be questioned i also became bored and my mind wandered as the bride took the length of my life to get hattori hanzo out of retirement to then construct her weapon of choice it seems that this will indeed as the title reads require a second viewing and hopefully results will vary,cruel
this was entertaining but didnt have the freshness and innovativity were used to seeing from tarantino the action sequences were nice not too overexaggerated like on romeo must die but still  this is a pure trend movie from the late 90s   kungfu movies have already been seen in the 70s and the 90s a couple of years ago it was sort of refreshing to see the old ideas being warmed up again using new technology but enough is enough and the story although good just doesnt carry the burden of staleness far enough to keep me eagerly waiting for the sequela big plus for the soundtrack and uma of course ,cruel
after all the computer generatedness of the last little while matrix reloaded ahem its refreshing to see someone who can triumph using plain old fashioned filmmaking sensetarantino creates great characters effortlessly with as little as a few pairs of sunglasses on a dashboard and this put with great choreography witty dialogue and a frankly baffling array of shooting styles has resulted in one of the most fun couple of hours at the cinema that ive had in a good whilethe movie though only the first part isnt hindered by its existence as only half a story and could easily stand alone with just a little tinkering of the storythough very violent at parts in keeping with the samurai movie tradition its never meant to be taken too seriously and thus isnt likely to offend anyone but the most squeamish but then again with a title like one would have to question the logic in them choosing this film in the first placesimply brilliant,cruel
as i started to watch i was taken aback by the new way in which it was presented nolonger a stereotypical hollywood film but a fantastic gritty story the flicks to animation caught me off gaurd but i loved the artistic way it was done the only unsure part of the film was when it flicked to black and white during the excessive blood i would have like to have seen all the fighting in colour but i did like the blinking of her eyes changing it back otherwise fantastic i cant wait for volume 2,cruel
disturbingly violent but overall a very good story with excellent direction less cussing than pulp fiction but a lot more blood  i can see why the director wanted to split into separate movies considering the detail he puts into the background of each character which makes the movie long definitely worth seeing,cruel
the 70s are often lauded as the era in which american cinema first reached the status of art as a new breed of directorauteur snatched the reins of film making from the old studio system  lucas and spielberg and the emergence of the modern blockbuster would mark the end of that era as the corporatization of the movie industry would reshape the very rationale for filmmaking itself the work of contemporary directors like tarantino fincher smith favreau etc may now be categorized as a new cinematic form one that selfconsciously reflects an appreciation for film in all of its varied manifestations  while coppola et al honed their craft under corman their later work abandoned the simple forms of exploitation cinema  tarantino more than any of his contemporaries found something to appreciate in all forms and nowhere is that more evident than in vol 1 while his previous work embraced 70s film aesthetic here tarantino is wearing his heart and influences on his sleeve vol 1 is a modern spaghetti western with heavy asian influences  the film follows the path of revenge taken by a character referred to a both the bride and black mambo her code name as a member of divas the deadly viper assassination squad  the divas are a parallel universe version of charlies angels a genius conceit through which tarantino also takes issue with modern cinematic violence  kbv1 is one of the most violent major american films of all time but its bloody aesthetic stands in sharp unsanitized contrast with the modern film versions of charlies angels where the protagonists often engage in bloodless unarmed combat and violence is easily dismissed as something can occur without the benefit of permanent injury if not death  in some sense the exaggerated gore in kbv1 serves as a constant reminder that combat is rarely bloodless and always injures someone whether physically or spiritually all this aside i cant recall a more enjoyable time spent at the movies  the plot is crisp the acting fantastic and the action scenes are unbelievable  the back stories are alternately tragic and touching with oren ishii origin story and the brides encounter with hattori hanzo being particular standouts  this is film as it should be artfully constructed without drawing attention to the often arbitrary distinctions between high and pop art  this film in particular forever shatters the significance of that distinction,cruel
possible spoilers oooh baby  ive been a fan of quentin tarantino since i first saw resivor dogs over ten years ago  in my intro to cinema class i took my freshman year at college in the fall of 94 i did a report on resivor dogs when i was asked by my classmates on what film i was doing my report on i replied resivor dogs directed by quentin tarantino  i got a blank and expressionless reaction after saying that with a response of whos he i had to answer hes the man who wrote natural born killers to get a full response from the classmate then two months later to my pleasure and enjoyment quentin tarantino became a household name and pulp fiction would change cinema history then to my displeasure everybody loved pulp fiction  people would dress up like the characters quote the movie even explain philosophical subtext of the movie the film attracted the same people who thought ferris buller was a righteous dude sportos motorheads geeks sluts bloods waistoids dweebies etc in the later part of 1994 until 1996 a cinema geek couldnt go anywhere without hearing the name quentin tarantino tarantino surprised everybody with his followup to pulp fiction with jackie brown a well done and intelligent homage to the blaxploitation film of the 1970s  a majority of the people that were attracted to tarantino from pulp fiction like the people associated with ferris buller felt tarantino didnt have what it took to make a entertaining movie  but jackie brown did deliver a great story with detailed characters and great dialogue it was just a film that needed to be seen more than once to enjoy  years later rumors and spectulation began to arise on tarantinos whereabouts causing a mystery surrounding a man who was claimed to be the man who talked too much now 2003 six years later tarantino returns with his 4th film and for those who felt tarantino lost his touch will be reborn again and for those like me who always enjoyed all of tarantinos films will have their expectations surpassed with this film the plot for vol 1 is very simple its a revenge story however since tarantino directs the film its not important on what the story is about but how the story is told  look at resivor dogs and pulp fiction  both films have stories that are pretty simple a diamond hiest gone wrong and two men delivering a briefcase to their boss  but seeing the way the storyteller tells those stories is what makes tarantino a brilliant director the story is about the bride aka black mamba uma thurman is shot and left for dead on her wedding day  the bride was attacked by the team she use to work for the deadly vemon viper squad oren ishiicottonmouth lucy liu vernita greencopperhead vivica a fox buddsidewinder michael madsen elle drivercalifornia mountain snake daryl hannah and their leader bill david carradine  four years later the bride comes out of her coma and immediately seeks revenge on the people that tried to kill her but since this is a tarantino film there is his usual style of filmmaking including fantastic shots complex characters great dialogue and monologues a groovy soundtrack wonderful settings and even a style of its own the characters are explained their background in detail as well however with bill the actors then display impressive and amazing acrobatic movement as they fight tarantino even does a jean lucgodard approach by manipulating the audience with having total control of the film and even the viewers  such a case is by having the dialogue of the bride character name bleep out when characters speak it  it similar to the whats in the briefcase theory of pulp fiction its left up to the viewers opinion  then there is the tast of retrofeel with the beginning title have the shaw scope and the 70s style music and title card with the words our feature presentation appear and like a tarantino film watching the film a second time around one could pick up on things that they missed ie chapter one 2 the number 2 is circled there is the flashy and stylish scenes such as when oren ishii and her crew sofie fatale julie dreyfus go go yubari chiaki kuriyama and others as they arrive at the house of the blue leaves  with the people moving in slowmotion to the cool beat of tomoyasu hoteis battle without honor of humanity then tarantino giving the film a great tracking shot following the characters around the club should i not forget the fight scenes  which i say make the martix reloaded look pale in comparision since the matrix resorted to being a philosophy movie instead of action and even surpasses the upcoming last samuari with tom cruise yes ive already seen that film and fight scenes are more impressive  and why shouldnt they be it was advised by the legendary wooping yuen who also did all three matrix films and crouching tiger hidden dragon  yet while the wachowski focused on the complex meaning and mystery of what the matrix is and give less action tarantino gives more action and having the viewer decide the meaning which makes the film more meaningful andenjoyable dont get me wrong i highly enjoy matrix and matrix reloaded but the action in those films are not as impressive as then there is the discussion of blood is there a lot  well the blood ratio in this film makes pulp fiction look like a pg13 film and no im not kidding  there is blood in this film a lot of blood  then tarantino hints to the audience that the blood factor shouldnt be taken seriously such as a decapitation with blood shooting out like a fountain  that obviously could never happen we know that and tarantino knows it and makes that point clearly with this film  tarantino even makes it more clear about the violence by having a japanesse animatied sequence showing massive blood and violence  yet to inform the audience that it shouldnt be taken seriously i havent been excited watching a movie the second time around more than the first time since last years gangs of new york  this was one fantastic and highly entertaining film  its a point that most hollywood and studio filmmakers should acknowlege when it comes to filmmaking  its not important on what the story is about but how you tell the story tarantino believes in that statement and it shows with  my only complaint is that i could have easily watched another 100 minutes or so of this film being how entertaining it is  i will say this and stand by this comment  i think would be more entertaining as a whole than watching any one of the lord of the rings films which isnt really a fair statement to make but as for pacing and enjoyment it is a true statementits a shame that tarantino doesnt release vol 2 by december 31st since the quality and satisfaction vol 1 shows it could have easily been a contender for this years oscars  i might be dreaming and off in lala land thinking of that statement nominated for best picture since there is a lot of violence the academy ignored the modern masterpiece city of god  but hey pulp fiction was nominated for best picture  with the exception of seabiscuit lost in translation return of the king finding nemo mystic river and maybe last samuari and master and command is there any other film that

i love the way quentin tarantino knows how to open a movie i was anticipating a patented faceslapper of an opening sequence and boy did i get it the movie starts with a quote revenge is a dish best served cold  a klingon proverb taken straight from the movie star trek ii the wrath of khan now from this point before the movie had actually begun i was ecstatic with anticipation to quote from star trek as if it where history was just way too cool for thought and the following scene a singular shot of a bloodied uma thurman as the bride shown in black and white managesto sum up the tone of right from the get goand bang youre in the film wastes no time heating up the screen and getting right into the thick of things violently tolerant tarantino commands your attention with every last shot its a return to his infamous form whilst also creating something original and challenging his approach to this film is unlike any of his previous efforts its a little less concerned with itself and is vamped up to ballistic mode this time around he has spent a lot of vigour tweaking the visuals and bending the style to his own unique fashion elements that were not so important in his other films have come to be vital in the telling of the colour tones choreography design and the explicit attention to detail all convey a very precise pitch of expression for a change this film is without much of the usual attention to dialogue tarantino gives he instead focuses that energy carefully on movement and body language the dialogue this time supports the film and doesnt carry itdirector quentin tarantino is a film buff at heart and finds pleasure in identifying that in a personal way channeling it through his films flying at ya from every avenue possible in the medium visuals audio etc are references homages and clichs in every shape and form its one thing to visually reference something or indicate it through dialogue its another to feel it and music does just that together with rza tarantino once again shows you the power of music in motion pictures the music changes sometimes dramatically but never feels wrong like the very story itself the song and score selection takes obvious inspiration from cult genres such as spaghetti westerns and classic kung fu pictures and like the movie the styles change and weave in and out in perfect rhythm that on its own manages to inspirethe fourth film by quentin tarantino is grandeur filmmaking from the master his directing style is incomparable and proves that he is indeed the commander of his own domain im in awe of the way he has made this film and believe now more strongly than ever that he is a rare maverick in the world of cinema this film is wonderful martial arts mayhem in an organized and timely manner how can i say this theres plenty of kung fu but its not a kung fu movie its something unto its own volume 1 is respectful of the many genres and cultural styles found here and has evolved these old influences into a new breed of film the biggest annoyance though is that even with the knowledge that volume 2 is to come early next year the ending was still too abrupt it just stops without warning or closure its as though tarantino literally snipped the movie in two oh well the action is a warm change from the cgi computer generated image revolution the matrix brought with it i think because its all so very traditional is a smart witty over the top action spectacle that will knock you flat its extra violent though so be warned if you cant stand the sight of blood this isnt pulp fiction  phase 2 its a whole new chapter in the book of tarantino one worth reading over and over and over again now bring on volume 2 you scumbagscore  5 out of 5,cruel
as if pulp fiction didnt confirm it finally certifies tarantino as a genius  what is a genius  someone who possesses uncanny knowledge of his medium and has the inborn skills to master and tranform his artformwith tarantino references everything from grindhouse cinema to sphaghetti westerns to early brian de palma giallos and even kurosawas samurai movies  however in the process of referencing these movies what makes tarantino so brilliant is that he reveals the artificiality of movies thus forcing us to laugh at instead of be repulsed by the copious amounts of gore and bloodshed  why  because all the spurting limbs beheadings and scalpings exist in a parallel cinematic universe totally divorced from the real worldto prove this point tarantino opens with a scene of intense bloodshed which culminates in the brides first victim lying in a pool of blood and a pool of kaboom cereal  the cereal with its fake facade and sugary coating is the ultimate symbol of the popculture world of movies which exists in  just like the tacky cereal the violence and blood in is so overthetop that anyone who takes it seriously is totally misguidedso for anyone who argues that is too violent they should stop eating cereal and leave the rest of us to indulge in our junk foodthat i suspect is why is receiving negative reviews from some highbrow critics the new yorker anyone  instead of referencing high art such as shakespeare and james joyce references what many refer to as trash cinema  but the true geniuses are the ones who like tarantino see the beauty in popular cultureproves that tarantino is both insane and brillianti also suspect that after tarantino may head in a completely different direction as he may run out of things to reference or he may start referncing his own moviesto all the naysayers go watch your six hour movies about rich snobs eating and killing the masses,cruel
ill make this short since no one wants to read another actingcinematographytonestorydirection recapis so fantastically vibrant and different from most all american action movies today that its no wonder so many people arthouse snobs cough despise it i mean being neutral to it is fine disliking it sure but to hate it on the level some people dowell i question their priorities it is just a movie after allthe film is one big homage like it or not  its all style cold stares quirky humor dizzying fight scenes  a wee bit of editing might have helped a tad i guess but this is tarantino for gods sakeyes naysayers have established time and again that hes often selfindulgent but who cares hes good at what he does  and to endlessly compare him to kubrick demigod to many film buffs or any other director is pointlessquentin wanted to make a film that was a sort of lovechild of all his fond memories of watching oldschool martial arts and samurai epicsthat means minimalist dialogue and any dialogue has to have some sense of selfaware homage buckets of spraying blood and fighting lots of fighting  if qt had put his usual prophet chic into it wouldnt have workedlike he said in several interviews kb takes place in a twisted universe different from our own even different from the magical realism of reservoir dogs and pulp fiction by the way jackie brown is not his best work as so many nonfans love to espouse for some reason  it was a misfire a wellintentioned one thoughto be fair i think the fact the movie was split in two does lessen the overall story somewhatit had to be done i know but hopefully once vol 2 comes out there will be a splicing together of the two films similar to the godfather epic for the dvdso people esp tarantino fans should stop comparing this to his other work because he wasnt trying to top his previous films he wanted to do something different and the result is a movie that i think is the epitome of cultappeal you like it or you loathe it  i loved it its not trying to whittle us down with unbearably asinine philosophy like matrix reloaded because thats quite simply not what isbelieve it or not every movie doesnt have to have an omniscient morality permeating through it if they all did when would we ever just enjoy ourselves at the theater arent movies first and foremost an escape  and although i guess ill be labeled an idiot by the snobs i honestly dont care  let them wallow in the selfcongratulatory crap they usually do often just so they can affirm themselves as smarter than everyone else i mean that is human nature after all  i personally like movies of all kindsand if every movie tried to be american beauty i think this would be a pretty bleak and downcast world wouldnt youequally horrendous are those people who call themselves true grindhouse fans and then bash qts film as lacking the fight scenes are crap uma cant handle a katana this smacks of subtle racism against nonasian female action stars methinks theres too much bloodeven if those claims were true theyre not why nitpick  anyone who really is a fan of these genres should be thanking tarantino not spitting in his face  or maybe you want your hobby to stay buried under the mainstream publics radar because otherwise you wont be so unique  in that case shame on youis cult just like master of death and street fighter sonny chibas not capcoms are cult just like the evil dead and pink flamingo and the adventures of priscilla queen of the desert are cult  and its damn good cult tooeh that wasnt so short oh well  go support this movie if you like the genre is the summation  because if you dont qt will fade away and lesser filmmakers will take his place crapping out cookiecutter remakes of the ateam and rollerball and god knows what else  and then we really are in troublebring on vol 2,cruel
ive noticed that many people even those who loved the film have said that this film is just an homage to grindhouse films and is the celebration of style over substance  while agreeing that the style of the film is so breathtakingly original as to potentially overshadow the substance i believe the idea that there is no substance to this film is gravely mistaken  when i watched it i saw archetypal images and themes filtered through an imagination with a real understanding of the zeitgeist of our culture creating an entirely new perspective on ancient even primeval issues  i saw a storysimple on the surfacein which women rebel against their sexual oppression by men almost every man seems to want sex with a main characterthe rapist boss matsumoto the goofy guy in the bar with go go and every one of them who does is subsequently brutally killed  go gos line do you still want to penetrate me  or is it iwho have penetrated you encapsulates this them with typical tarantino economy and style  i see a story of lost innocenceevery young character witnesses a horrible act of violence and the question is perpetually asked how will they deal with it  i see a movie that exhibits the idea in our social consciousness that the world is shrinking and the rise of eastern ideas in our western culture  i see an undercurrent of the immense repercussions when a great potential the brides is violently repressed and then unleashed  i see a stylized mediation on the catharsis of violence as well as a film with a deep understandings of the very real effects of that violence in the real world  and somehowthat thing that makes this film brilliantits supremely unequivocally immensely enjoyable to watch it is a movie that tells us why its okay that we love to see violencebrutal visceral bloody violencein our art even though we know that violence in the real world is a terrible terrible thing  1010,cruel
i really enjoyed tarantinos latest flick awesome choreography camerawork and effects combined with plenty of action and a tolerable plotline something thats becoming disappointingly uncommon these days if you dont mind blood and gore i strongly suggest you go see but dont expect a masterpiece its not nearly perfect but still very enjoyable a nice semimocking tribute to the martial arts films of old,cruel
quentin tarantinos vol12003is one of the best movies i have seen this yeartarantino perfectly mixes beautiful imagery with highly stylized violencewonderful uma thurman shines as the brideshe is seeking revenge for horrible atrocities she has suffered at the hand of mysterious billthe fight choreography by yuen wo ping is amazingstill the film is not as violent as some people claimin actualitythe violence is so cartoonish and overthetop it can only be seen as amusingthe film is clearly a homage to japanese samurai cinemahong kongs kung fu movies and italian spaghetti westernsi think that tarantino was inspired by such movies like thrillera cruel picture1974lady snowblood seriessleepy eyes of death seriesshogun assassin1980battle royale2000plus various sonny chiba and bruce lee flicksanywayi enjoyed this film and you should tooespecially if youre a fan of exploitation cinema,cruel
this movie is the perfect watchwithyourmouthopen flick  its visually pleasing with all of the camera angles and kung fu scenes humorously macabre see blood squirt for long times from a severed arm and consistent with other tarrantino film themes murder revenge action power struggles those who have written that the writerdirector has no range with his stories apparently never read an interview with qt  he is not a comingofage movie type guy  his interest lies in movies that inspired him as a youth and his focus in cinema is on violent sarcastic action flicks with smarmy dialoguethe only downside is that i have to wait until volume 2 to see what happens next  i wasnt ready to leave the theater,cruel
that tarantino has a real passion for the movies we all knew that he loves his quirky leftofcenter soundtracks we were never in any doubt that he could successfully pull off another ultrastylish genrebusting event movie whilst from dawn till dusk and jackie brown good as they were still withered in the dazzling light of reservoir dogs and pulp fiction we wondered and wonderedhas quentin tarantino writer and director of reservoir dogs and pulp fiction still got what it takes has been worth the wait or is it merely a good moviewell relax because vol1 sees tarantino back to his true formthe story is simple a basic revenge movie but this is only a structure on which tarantino can hang his stylish visual feast  from the outset his influences come thick and fast martial arts 70s baxploitation akira kurasowa alfred hitchcock sergio leone and many more however how many would have ticked the checkbox marked japanese anime that many huhis ultra violent but in a graphic novel sort of way that is hard to take offence anyone who has seen other asian exploitation movies such as battle royale with cheese and ichi the killer even monty python and the holy grail will know what to expectthe film constantly surprises and always entertains but the biggest revelation is uma thurman as the bride she not only kicks ass she also gives a performance which constantly walks a tightrope between seriousness and parody with such skill she gives johnny depp in pirates a run for his money so much so the tarantinothurman partnership could almost be the new scorcesede niro for the new millenia well seeto say kicks ass is no measure of its success pulp fiction doesnt kick ass reservoir dogs doesnt kick ass what they do do however is to showcase a blinding storytelling talent that excites and inspires a new generation of kids all around the world into being film directors like the movies of peckinpah hitchcock kurasowa leone scorcese did for the present generation of filmakersquentin tarantinos unabashed passion for the movies is there for all to see it excites inspires and above all rekindles our love in the moviesthat is success thats what does,cruel
it all depends when do you want to diethis is difficult to review half of a movie yes few things were missing like the introduction of some characters but knowing that there is a second volume makes all the differenceuma in her yellowsuited  la bruce lee is a clin doeil to the old and cheap kungfu movies in the other hand there is a perfect reflection of the good spaghetti western a real salute to sergio leonethe fights scenes were absolutely brilliant matrix beware and i thought the switch to black  white at the house of the blue leaves was quite genius as well as the manga part so clever the music is so tarantino just the way i like it imagine a real kungfu fight on a western spaghetti music which is probably there to reflect umas vendetta from the place of the massacre just brilliant the traditional and modern japanese culture was very realistic you have to understand that this is very different from our occidental culture and so it can be a bit surprising and even funny sometimesis a success and this is only the first part and please before judging it wait to see volume two really cant wait for the second volume,cruel
i really liked this movie it reminded me a lot of black belt theatre when i was growing up uma thurman looked good kicking a the music was crazy and catchy at the same timethis movie makes me think of what actually happens to coma patients in real lifecringecant wait to see the volume 2,cruel
this was the best movie that i have seen in a very long time  i do not know enough superlatives to describe this movie without sounding like i was paid to say it i was hooked from the very first bang all the way through to the end that seemed to come much too soon  the story made sense the acting was incredible and the fight scenes did not have that fake look that i grew to dislike in other movies such as matrix reloaded  the infusion of comedy anime the japanese language with subtitles and a great soundtrack added even more enjoyment and excitement to this wonderful movie tarantino has outdone himself as well as all of the actors choreographers special effects etc  i cant wait to see it again and again  if you liked or loved pulp fiction youll go crazy over this  the same is true in reverse though  if you did not like pulp fiction you might not like this either although i just cannot imagine anyone not enjoying this movie  i dont have any complaints  my husband however thought it would have been better if uma thurman and lucy lui had switched roles  i could somewhat see that but i enjoyed it tremendously as is,cruel
after waiting 6 years for quentin tarantinos 4th movie i was expecting nothing else but an outstanding movie and as usual quentin delivered the fight scenes in this film were absolutely amazing impossible but still amazing especially black mambas thurman fight with gogo yubari uma looked like a great fighter in this film her trainers done a great jobtarantino has a habit of bringing superb showings out of has been actors and he has done it again in this movie with brilliant showings from carradine thurman and hannahi truly recommend everyone go see this film outstanding 1010,cruel
this movie was da bomb it brought me back to the time when i used to go to the saturday kung fu marathon of the old good kung fu flicks from hong kong etc quentin did it again the flick was one of the best ones ive seen this year and im a movie fanatic i truly enjoyed the film his choice of protagonist was excellent the scenes with lucys characters underlings and uma was some of the greatest fight scenes in a long time way surpasses even the the matrix vol 2 im there,cruel
to tell the truth ive never been a tarantinos fan and i wasnt really eager to this movie i saw it yesterday and i was stunned i was great some people say that its too violent or theres too much blood or something how dont they understand that its not the point of the movie  its its necessary part but it doesnt show the violence  its the means of expressing directors ideasi liked alomost everything in this movie beatiful professional stunning910,cruel
to those who give bad reviews because of gore i say pish i mean its a tarantino movie if youve seen such films as reservoir dogs pulp fiction or natural born killers one should expect the maximum amount of violence in the film to say that it is a bad movie because of the gore is overlooking the cinematic masterpiece that it is is so welldone cinematically that it is a viewing pleasure throughout the whole film and unlike anything else youve seenalso to those who complain about it being overthetop and unrealistic its a movie and while it is overthetop at least it is consistent throughout the whole film it makes it kind of funny the way everything is overdonethis is just my opinion why is a pleasurable viewing experience and an artistic cinematic milestone very entertaining and a fun adrenaline rush throughout,cruel
tarantino has done it again this time kung fu style and he dose a damn good job of it  the story starts off in a little church in texas where black mamba played by uma therman is about to get married but its not a happy occasion she is beat almost to death and then shot  4 years later after being in a coma for that long she finially awakens and seeks revenge on the people who attempted to kill heri found this movie very bloody more so then classics like scarface and reservoir dogs but thats just what i think  this movie gets an instant 1010 everything about this movie was brilliant and i cant wait for vol 2 i hope this review has helped some of you,cruel
i thoroughly enjoyed this movieenough to see it twice in one week as expected uma thurman lucy liu daryl hannah  vivica fox put on great performancestarantino gives us fully fleshed out female protagonistsantagonists playing up their femininity without patronizing them in their physical abilitiesthe audiences intelligence is never insultedthe anime sequence was well integratedit was a brilliant additionthose who never considered the artform as mature enough for adults may have been pleasantly surprisedi could go on forever about the cinematography costume designthe score which is tightthanks to the black male genius rzai cant wait to cop the dvd,cruel
grotesque at times but skillfully and tastefully done if hard to watch however it was completely necessary to create the mood that tarantino was going fori loved the soundtrack it was probably the best of all of his movies to date in my opinion  good combination of beautiful authentic japanese music mixed with american style at times incrediblei loved this movie and i cant wait for vol 2,cruel
i totally agree with the guy who says that vol 1 is a movie with both good and bad scenes some parts of the movie are very well done with class and style like only tarantino can do  he makes the goriest scenes look like an art form theres good japanese music that creates the perfect atmosphere and a lot of blood however you wont find really interesting dialogues between the characters and when kb turns into a sensless kungfu action movie  its a little disappointing  15 minutes of swordplay and wired stunts are boring and spoil in part the rest of the movie i would still recommend it because its highly entertaining but if you are not into martial arts go with low expectations v1 is much better than jackie brown  but doesnt even come close to pulp fiction or reservoir dogs,cruel
after waiting six years since his last piece of cinematic genius mr tarantino has come back to the limelight with a bang and some arterial spurts it is seemed like the director had just wanted to become the prodigal son walking the earth and to rediscover himself before allowing himself again to be loved by the mainstream again however this time he is does not have any witty lines amongst a couple of gangsters but a bunch of kick ass martial arts ladies kicking the crap out of each other a kinda of anti charlie angels a sense of irony there since lucy liu also stars in this movieanyway i digress and i would like to explain the concept of the movie before then i would like to warn possible spoilers aheadit starts off with a black and white close up of the bride uma thurman left almost to die off screen you hear bill the mysterious boss of assassination gang divas trying to justify his actions upon her before placing a bullet in her head this sets you off for the big rollercoaster ride the bride awakes from a four year coma and boy is she wrathful for what has happened and so she tries to seek revenge the first person that she gets medival is copperhead who is an ex divas assassin who was involved for the near death of the bride enter a superb knife duel bitch fight set amongst the leafy surburbs of california after annihililating her opponent in front of copperheads pre school daughter the bride makes a move to toyko to seek and hunt down the next on her list oren ishii lucy liu the movie then turns into first how the oren has become what she has become in a style of japanese anime afterwards it shows how the bride seeks help from the old but wise master harroti hanzo the legendary japanese actor sonny chiba by obtaining a hand made sword by the man himself after this it is all fun and games martial arts style violence come thick and fast like blood spurting out of a freshly severed head which happens many a time in this movie but this is a tarintino moviei will not try to give too much away which at this moment of time is gonna be quite hard however from what you have read from this review i would hope that you would see this movie the acting in this movie is not thespian style acting and the dialogue is not all to what tarintino can give but it is the martial arts scenes and the visual medley of cinematic art in which would should be shown to budding film students and veterans alike this movie would have to be said to be the greatest westernised martial arts movies if not the most violent and it should be watched by anyone who loves a good cinematic experience that includes all the daily mail readersrating 1010,cruel
from the outset this is tarantinos moviealthough uma thurman almost wrests it awayumas a bride seeking revenge on a group of assassins who killed her entire wedding party at the altar pretty much she just hunts them down and with sword fights and severed limbs tries to kill them all whats staggering is thurman manages to inject a resigned frailty into whats essentially the role of a coldblooded killer somehow amid the fountains of blood this is oscar contender actingit is extraordinarily violent possibly one of the most violent western movies of all times the blood gushes and heads roll and while in the earlier parts of the movie tarantino merely hints at the violence he shows it all in living colour and black and white and japanese animation toward the end hes not making a point hes saluting the justasviolent hong kong and japan movies many whities have never seenis brilliantly made there are thousands of reasons not to see this movie but only one to see it its very difficult to take in the sheer amount of lightningquick tarantino touches such as daryl hannahs eyepatch this needs to be seen more then three or four times you may be tempted to either go home in disgust or watch it again right then the direction is amazingthe music mistakes and jumps in film costumes and colours the fight scenes its all made brilliantly albeit without a trace subtlety but tarantino is hardly known for thatand if anyone wants to claim he stole wirefight ideas from the matrixjust remember the matrix stole it from japan first,cruel
wow what a major disappointmenti bought the original soundtrack a few weeks back played it once and never played it again tarantinos ost choices are some of the best cds ive ever heard the one while not terrible was so forgettable and backgroundmusiclite that i should have seen this as some kind of omenthe movie in short is actually pretty terriblei know what quentin was attempting to do i grew up watching the asian martial arts flicks of the 1970s and early 1980s and i loved them there was something incredibly satisfying about the incredible physical realism of seeing those guys strut their stuff guys like sonny chiba who features in left an impression on me that will never be forgotten their allaround coolness with martial artistry that topped anything youd see from hollywood was a revelationhowever i hated the wire work i hated ninjas that could leap thirty feet vertically i hated the fact that they possessed superstrength and never seemed to tire i hated the fact that for some stupid codeofhonour reason the bad guys only ever fought the good guys oneonone despite overwhelming odds and i hated the ridiculously overthetop bloodworkunfortunately tarantino in his quest for the perfect homage concluded that would have to feature all of these awful traits and more and for someone who has openly criticised the matrix movies for their use of wirefu i thought it was pretty rich indeed that featured so much obvious use of wireassistancethe plot is simplicity itself its your basic revenge thriller the bride played by uma thurman wakes from a fouryear coma to find herself not only less the child she was carrying but at the receiving end of godknows how many unwarranted sexual advances as her surething dormant body was leased out to hicks for a straight 75throw this obviously pses her off big time but when we learn through flashbacks of the massacre of her husbandtobe and entire party at her wedding four years prior well shes really not very happy at allthe killings were orchestrated by her former employer bill leader of the muchfeared deadly viper assassination squad which includes oren ishii lucy liu elle driver darryl hannah budd michael madsen and vernita green vivica a fox at the wedding the bride is beaten severely the final blow coming from a bullet straight into her head at close range from bill her final words the baby is yours before he pulls the trigger nicethe bride draws up her death list the five members of the viper squad that she will kill leading up to bill himselflike pulp fiction before it isnt told in sequence its not as clever as pulp but the opening scene for example is actually the end of the movie timewise it works because you move straight into the action and if actions your bag then youre laughing baby the film is pretty much nonstop action bar a few necessary plot movements and pauses and initially youre grateful because this is what you came to see by the end of the flick however youre praying for it to move on like most films of this type ultimately the reason you came to see the movie is lost fights blend into each other and you find yourself checking your watchhowever in other tarantino movies these endless battles would have been saved by the little slices of genius in between this is so not the case in for someone who has built his career on dialogue some of the shite uttered by the cast in this flick has to be heard or read  lots of subtitles to be believedmostly its the japanese translations that fall totally flat sonny chiba for example utters the immortali can tell you with no ego that this is my finest blade if on your journey you should encounter god god will be cuthello god is jewish  of course hes cut as you have probably read this is a very violent movie quentin got the film past the credits for three reasons one the blood and gore is so overthetop that it cannot be taken seriously at all its cartoon violence two the most disturbing scene of the movie which traces orens history is shown entirely in anime obviously this was necessary because it features a young child and includes the notion of paedophilia however the scene is so sleazy that it will leave a terrible taste in your mouth again i know what he was doing but anime is so awful so ridiculously dated that it just plain sucked finally a concluding scene of the movie is shown entirely in black and white this gets the critics past the most overuse of blood that youre going to see in any flick post brain dead its also played for laughs and you guessed it pretty much sucksthats what really gets to me with this film quentin as ive repeatedly spewed was making a direct homage to those asian movies of the 70s however while these films hold on an important place in the heart of many a fan these films could never be described as good pieces of work fun sure important maybe but as i laid out above so much of them was utter garbage and even as a tenyear old i found myself shaking my head repeatedly throughout a viewing by not removing these parts and indeed highlighting them quentin has taken what could have been a fantastic homage into a nearparody you want blood sure here you go  lets take johnny depps death scene in a nightmare on elm street and make everybody shoot blood out like that when they die you want chopped off limbs sure here you go  lets make everybody lose at least one limb and have arms legs and heads flying all over the place you want our hero facing ridiculous overwhelming odds in this case of eightyeight to one and still come through even though the bad guys could have just rushed her and  god forbid  pulled out a gun at any time and ended the battle in seconds sure here you go  and lets not only let her beat them easily but have a laugh while shes doing itworse tarantino sets up these concepts in the movie but then breaks them ok so people bleed ridiculous amounts of blood before they die  fine but then dont have somebody dying within minutes of having their tongue bitten out only for someone else to live out half of the movie with several limbs missing duhhh in the case of the latter she must have been in possession of eighty or so pints of blood because she lost at least twenty with her first arm yes its not meant to be taken seriously obviously but it should have been this should have been a serious moviethe acting is decent enough im not totally convinced that uma thurman was right for this role but quentin worships the ground she walks on almost literally the closeups of her disgusting chimplike feet turn your stomach clearly she was in good shape but more than once it was obvious that the distance shots of her fighting were actually some geezer in a blonde wig only for the camera to then zoom in for a grimacing closeup of our umayou dont see much of bill david carradine or budd madsen but the female members of the viper squad are given serious screen time and with beauties like uma lucy liu daryl hannah and vivica a fox nobody was really complaining except me i guess i dont find any of these women all that attractive liu and fox stand above the reason thurman used to be gorgeous but now shes a walking skeleton hannah has always looked like a walking skeleton her character is terrible an eyepatch has never been cool especially on a woman and a medical eyepatch even less so a terrible scene aside from the bride lius oren gets the most background and shes the second best part of this movie both from an acting and character perspective outside of the posse and getting sound applause all round chiaki kuriyamas battle royale go go yubari armed with ball and chain is perhaps the one genuine reason to go and see this flick shes ubercool and you gotta love the insanity in those eyes youd love to fuck her but you know that pretty much for sure youd never survive it ease up cowboy kuriyama is 19 years old she kicks arse you have to respect a woman who knows how to handle balls so masterfully i loved herthe film is split into five chapters and the final part shows us the longcoming battle between the bride and oren its a nice scene prefixed by the bride singlehandedly beating orens crazy 88 without hardly breaking a sweat and then facing oren herself clearly theres much respect between the two and the samuraiinspired scene filmed outside in a beautiful snowy landscape is very attractive indeed if only it handed ended so lousily quentin mate you set it up so wonderfully and then pull the snowy rug away and leave us with farce i saw shades of hannibal and wouldnt have been surprised if it concluded with the bride tucking into a cerebral snack when she got back on the plane and what was the deal with the bride being allowed to have her sword next to her on every flight hello hello quentin is anybody home shockinga few quentinesque touches were nice a big poster that the bride walks past displays red apple cigarettes the bride dons a pair of clarances true romance elvis sunglasses i like that but overall the usual feeling of cleverness so eloquently expressed by pulp fiction and jackie brown was missingas i mentioned earlier usually tarantinos choice of music is pretty much spoton every time i hear stuck in the middle with you im sent straight back to that cops hell at the hands of michael madsens mr blonde likewise the pulp fiction ost is about as good as it gets in this movie quentin once again throwing a nod towards the 1970s asian flicks chose to set up a scene pretty much exclusively on the back of the music the oren ishiibride final battle is totally dominated by a very loud and in my opinion poorly chose theme that totally undercuts the beauty and impact of that fight it just didnt work at all theres some good stuff on the ost but it pales next to his other moviesas does as a whole its easily quentins worst flick to date my gut reaction when it came out as that was bollocks but i told myself to go away and think about it i have done it was bollocks sure it was stylish bollocks and there is some really good stuff in there but overall its still bollocks quentinworshippers will defend the superficiality of the movie with the same force that they would have tornapart a jeanclaude van damme flick that featured the same identical ridiculous scenes and thats their prerogative but however much you look at it and want to like it this film is flawed and its for the very same reasons that inspired tarantino to make it in the first place the truth is as i said and this comes from a big fan that those films of the 1970s just arent really all that good and despite the cool fighting and style when you get below the surface theres very little underneath indeed sure ill go and see the sequel  i do want to know how it pans out but no matter how many times you watch this flick its never going to open up for you like pulp fiction did,cruel
volume 1from the opening titles we know we are in for something different  from the first line we know we are in for something special  from the first image we know we are in for something powerfuldo we get it  hell yeahquentin tarantino has delivered to the screen a martial arts tourdeforce ultraviolent coolashell cinematic masterpiece  he has returned in fine form after 1997s blaxploitation flick jackie brown giving us what is sure to be the most original film of the year  interesting considering he uses so many homages and retro references within the body of his work tarantino is master of his craft and he has proven this once againthe plot is not overlycomplicated the bride thurman massacred on her wedding day along with nine others including her husband and a coloured organ player watch out for this reference as theres a great cameo in vol 2 awakes from a four year coma to reek revenge on those responsible  the deadly viper assassination squad divas headed by the mysterious bill it is the way tarantino takes this revenge plot and delivers it to us in nonsequential temporal order with delicious turning points and mesmerisingly choreographed fight sequences that makes this a true work of art  this is definitely an exercise in style with a perfectly manipulated collage of techniques including black  white split screens title screens chapters bleeping out a characters name altering temporal order and an amazing anime sequence to deliver the back story of oren ishii liulucy liu delivers possibly her best performance but it is uma thurman who is at the top her game  she owns this role  even the supporting characters leave an impact and include cameos from sonny chiba who i first realised tarantino was a fan of when i saw the theatre scene in true romance michael parkes one of tarantinos favourite actors  playing a role similar to that in from dusk till dawn and michael bowen from jackie brown making an interesting appearance as buckbut it is not just tarantino and the actors who excel as oscar winner robert richardson finds a nice balance of his and quentins style in the cinematography some of the lighting is distinctly richardson some of the shots distinctly tarantino  and this film is a visual feast beautiful shots exquisite sets and appropriate costume designs help digest the story  the final act in and out of the house of the blue leaves is perhaps the best example of the consummation of these filmic elementsthe final act especially but not restricted to also lets martial arts gurus fan boys and film geeks have a field day with the various references to martial arts and pop culture  from costumes to characters music sets and opening titles tarantino manages to take elements that are familiar and make them feel fresh unique and original  similar to what he did with the stories in pulp fictionif i have one complaint about this movie it is that it is not long enough and you are left begging for volume 2  although what would be the midact turning point at the end certainly has impact  a question posed by bill that if you have being paying attention has been answered  the trouble is now tarantino has set the standard volume 2 is going to have even higher expectations  but at least this way he does get to show his complete story in a brave move by harvey scissorhands weinstein  not many directors would be allowed this privilege  but when you see it youll know whythis is not for everyones taste  and if you thought reservoir dogs was too graphic then perhaps you mightnt appreciate this  but personally i think it is the best film of the year  it is definitely the film to beat for originality craftsmanship and pure entertainmentthis moment this is me at my mostmasochistic david carridine as bill,cruel
volume one is definitely on my top five favorite movies the movie tied everything together so perfectly making everything flo together with such ease the fighting scenes were amazing some people say this movie is too violent but i disagree this movie is rated r after all so what do they expect this definitely earns a 10 and im still suprised that its only at 91250 im sure its ranking will go higher though i mean why wouldnt iti definitely can not wait until the second volume will be released,cruel
sorry but i just didnt like this film much  even though uma thurman is fantastic in her role as the bride the storytelling leaves much to be desired  outside of thurman theres not much character developmentmany of them are lifeless and i found it interesting that lucy lius character was more developed in sections where she wasnt actually acting610,cruel
after the film i realised how hard it is to be qt and come out with a new film people will expect nothing but the best when youve made films like he has in the past so im pleased to say i wasnt dissapointed this movie adds in with pulp fiction and reservoir dogs as a qt masterpiece love the perfect use of anime the soundtrack is as allways with qt perfect and the use of over exaggerated violence it all makes it a great movieonly thing i miss is those great comments which will be spoken so many times by qt fans and offcours thos hillarious moments where your not supposed to laugh but you still ie marvin in the car u pulp fictionafter the film i realised how hard it is to be qt and come out with a new film people will expect nothing but the best when youve made films like he has in the pasttho like qt says vol 1 is just a andrenaline burst in vol 2 there will be those qt trademarks cant wait1010,cruel
what is the deal with quentin tarantino he is haled as a god by pretty much everyone in hollywood apart from spike lee maybe he is so good at self promotion that he has the world fooled into thinking that he is maha raja of la la land when in fact he is nothing more than an average movie maker resevior dogs was a pretty good movie when you concider that it was his first pulp fiction had everything you could want in a film jackie brown well to be honest i cant remember much about it which says everything really and his latest is juststraight to video tosh the action is no where near as good as the hype would lead you to believe it simply cannot compare to the likes of crouching tiger or the earlier jackie chan flicks he relies way too much on very shody wire work and crap camera techniques and the script which in his past movies have always been brilliant was just well not very good really and what was with all the gore i like a little blood and guts just as much as the next guy but only when its used properlly the film was so bloody that it actually got really boring by the time you saw the 20th person have a limb hacked off ok so the film had one or two redeeming features lucy lu being one and sonny chiba being the other but that was about it really one thing that i did find very funny though was the fact that most of the audience didnt realise that the movie was part one of two the abrupt ending left people wondering what was going on that was funny i know that im going to have annoyed quite a few movie geeks out there who worship at the holy shrine of tarantino but hey get a life if you want to see really visionary movies check out the likes of the coen brothers instead of those made by a self publicising brat i thank you,cruel
wow quentin tarantino is back with a vengeance director tarantino has created a film that incorporates many styles into it with a heavy nod to the martial arts of the far eastit was a stroke of his genius to cast uma thurman as the protagonist of this tale of revenge ms thurman has not played anything before with so much relish and verve as she does here in this film she continues to show that led by a good director like tarantino can work wonders for her as it was the case in pulp fiction these two belong together and doubt they will collaborate more in the future only next time dont show us her toesthe cast assembled for the film is very effective although this version shows too much of lucy liu who is as blank as a white piece of paper perhaps she should be paired next time out with keanu reeves just think of the possibilities and what a great couple they would makethe master is back so now give us part ii,cruel
tarentino has hit the proverbial jackpot yet again with this ultraviolent homage to 70s kung fu movies it seemed in my personal opinion that after jackie brown that q had fallen off his pedastal as a director but after watching this i will never doubt him again this movie had everyone in the theatre by the throat from the opening scene and didnt let go until the movie credits rolled im ready for volume 2 quentinshow us your bloody worstone problem i have noticed is that everyone who didnt like the movie can be grouped into 2 groups 1 very religious type or 2 people who that are completely oblivious to who quentin tarentino is and how his movies are,cruel
quentin tarantino reaches out through the screen and grabs the audience by the throat and hangs on until the end when we crawl towards the screen leaving a bloody trail screaming more morei dont think i have ever been more thoroughly entertained by a movie every scene was nearly perfect absolute perfection being unobtainable every performance was captivating and believable  the sound track was amazing  not only was the music itself mesmerizing but every note added to the impact of the film no mean featmy only complaint i would rather have seen a three hour movie than have it split in two  but i would guess thats not tarantinos fault rather the fault of studio executives more interested in money than art,cruel
im not going to spoil this for anyone with details of what the film contains but i will say that this isnt pulp fiction or even jackie brown it will appeal to kung fu bmovie fans  anyone thats been stuck in the arctic for the last 10 years  hasnt seen his last 3 i must say that the animation sequence is brilliant to inject such graphics in the middle of a film that was already juddering was a bold move but just the sheer quality of it makes quentin come out smelling of roses its a good film mr t thats tarantino not ba baracus but theres something just not right about it,cruel
there are no words to describe how utterly amazing this film it from the very first scene it grabs you and leaves you beaten begging for more everyone is brilliant in it lucy lui stands out and almost steals the limelight from quentin tarantinos leading lady uma thurman i highly reccomend anyone to sit through this and not leave with a huge smile on their face wonderful,cruel
to give tarantino credit vol 1 like his other movies is a well crafted stylish and entertaining picture technically speaking it is solid on virtually every level unfortunately it is also a literal blood bath of fetishized violence on par with the goriest of horror moviesnormally i can handle seeing limbs chopped off or geysers of blood streaming out of a decapitated torso or a close up of a handgun blast to a head but thats because usually there is some kind of meaningful reason attached to it in other words i accept some degree of violence to tell a storysadly tarantino just seems to really like violence for its own sake and appears to be just another vehicle for his desire to bring carnage to the screen its basically another iteration of from dusk til dawn which had a flimsy story constructed to justify a slaughter of humans and vampires the notable difference is that instead of selfdefense the protagonist is motivated by pure revengeperhaps if we knew what was going on we could really get behind our hero and rationalize all the killing as good but the film tells us nothing we dont know why she is involved with her enemies what she has done to earn their hatred or what kind of person she is is she honorable is she a modern day samurai or is she just a psychopathic killer with a penchant for swordsif you want blood youll love this movie if you want some kind of context for violence a good story about honor in battle or something with any kind of meaning dont waste your time check out ghost dog or gladiator insteadkb vol 1 gets a 55 from me,cruel
if tarantino was absent for 4 years in order to create this then he should have stayed in hibernation a homage to the japanese martial arts flicks if so then it was just another american crass remake if it was not for a few memorable martial arts moments then this film was instantly forgettable i walked out thinking i can not remember one line of dialogue the characters were all two dimensional just like the anime in the middle and the talent on show was a complete waste if the best bits are in the next film then it is an even bigger con however i seem to think many of them ended up on the editing floor classic tarantino this is not finding nemo is a better film and i disliked that film,cruel
yes its violent yes its the more bloody movie that ive seen in my life life  but yes its also the best movie of 2003  tarantino is back and he should be proud to have done this movie  he proved that he is able to do other kinds of movies  not just a gangster thriller  pulp fiction will stay the main film of tarantino but is now very near of the top and the musicperfect  i hope that the second volume will be like the first,cruel
uma thurman dress like our late bruce lee on game of death in japan fought against the black mask hornet and the sound track from green hornet way cool and lucy lu   fights like the real samurai swordswomen in the late satoichithe wolf and the cub movies way cool,cruel
did not live up to its promise interestingly preceding the movie i saw previews for lord of the ring the king returns and matrix revolutions both films rely heavily on film technique martial artsfighting and violence the difference between and lotr and matrix is that has no substance and invokes no emotional resonance with me lotr and matrix in contrast tell a compelling story on multilevels  unfortunately is all flash all technique all form borrowed and copied and no story that resonates with the audience i felt nothing on walking out of the movie i never got involved with any character i sat back and watched the movie noting and appreciating its technique music and staged fights more importantly i felt sad that tarentinos considerable talents are wasted on copying and inflating the martial arts form instead of using that form to tell a compelling story is that classic movie  style over substance maybe q tarentino is not interested in stories with emotional content maybe he is just interested in the technique of telling a story,cruel
if youre looking for a normal runofthemill action extravaganza  move along  this movie wont be for you not that there wont be scenes that anyone would enjoy  true to his craft mr tarantino has succeeded in creating an askew version of the widelyused revenge plot making it fresh interesting and entertaining  i think everyone should see this film twice even if you didnt like it the first time  its amazing some of the things youll catch on viewing it a second time  just when i think ive got this one figured out he goes a throws another curve ball making the whole thing like a story from an alternate genre all togetherit was so nice to see umas return after how ever long its been  it just seems like she pops up every once in a while and this was different for her and a refreshing changelucy lu played the part of a cold and calculating assassin to a tea  the role was perfect for her and the music is really great if not at times somewhat comical like the theme to green hornet playing shortly after the mention of the kato masks classicanyway i really liked this movie despite and because of its abnormality  i dont mind a repetitive theme in movies as long as theres some creativity to it like in 910 thank you,cruel
either you have the chops to enjoy tarentino or you dont  i was not disappointed with kb1  it had been so long since pulp fiction and jackie brown i have to admit i was afraid quentin would lay an egg butno problem  i bought the sound track about ten days before going to see the movie and played it a lot turn it up  please as a warmup the sound track is killer  favorite moment  uma looks at go go and her ball and chain and arches an eyebrow  10 out of 10 cant help myself tarantino makes nine out of ten other movies seem boring boring boring,cruel
everyone must see this movie asap  please please ignore those few silly reviews that are slating this movie i went to see it today with my girlfriend and we were both more than impressed i thought that every second of this movie was precious movie timei urge all the doubters out there to go and give this movie at least a chance  i very much doubt that you will be disappointed,cruel
ive seen a lot of kung fu movies and ive seen a lot of samurai films takes those mix together a little japanese anime and a whole lot of violence and you get one wicked awesome movie with enough blood to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty of us movie goers and some great actingemotion that really sells what is basically a cheesy action flick with style cant wait for the second part,cruel
as i watch this film viewing the marvels that flash before my eyes i wonder what it must be like to be as brilliant as tarantino is literally 3 opposite emotions are thrown in your face all at once and it takes the rest of the movie to get them off some scenes are so disturbingly sad that you want to burst into tears but then you remember you cant because something gross just happened now you want to throw up but you cant because that joke that just happened is so funny you might choke on your puke and die and thats just one minute from the moment you walk into the theater and see the opening shot you realize that this movie has a hold on you and its not about to let go tarantino proves himself as one of the greatest directors the world has seen making a huge deal about this being his 4th film symbolism and metaphors are commonplace in this film but not in the sense youd expect he uses them not as a way to make the audience understand whats happening but rather it seems as entertainment for himself and what entertains him sure is going to entertain you dont expect to leave the cinema feeling good about yourself the devil inside you will love this movie and will force you to go back in 2004 to see the conclusion which if were not careful could end up competing against part one for an oscar who knows pulp fiction got one,cruel
i had low expectations going into this one  the reviews in the nyc papers were near unanimous in giving it only two and a half stars  it was supposed to be a wild ride but ultimately emptywhat i got was maybe the best action movie ive ever seen  maybe qt has raised expectations to the point where this simplified plot was not enough to please the critics  but dayamn this was a great action film  best sustained fight scene ive ever seen  if these critics can praise the lameass matrix series then how can you discount this one  which was much more intriguing and actionpacked than either matrix flick  highly recommended  cant wait for pt 2,cruel
one of the ways by which i qualify these types of movies is by noting if a sustained state of exhilaration is manifested  came through with loads left over like receiving metered doses of crank at just the right moments without the inevitable crash afterward  now for this to be effective in my eyes the film must have a certain sumptuousness to ita certain quality of beauty and artful delineation woven into the action it was there  also the action has to be delivered in a freshly innovative pace without being noisy  tarantino pulls this off as well using an almost breezy humor to keep the mood from becoming morose with all thematic violence ie crouching tiger hidden dragon  those who would call this violence gratuitous are being flip  gratuitous violence is uncalled for typically used to illicit some type of reaction when the film is failing on all other fronts  one may not like the style of but the film has integrity with the violence being an integral part of the whole piece i urge those with thicker skins to check this one out  it was a clever and rewarding riot  all you socially responsible viewers check out mystic riveranother wonderful film with a whole different agenda,cruel
what makes quentin the genius that he is well ill tell you his brain has spent countless hours recording every cliche camera angle piece of pop culture and character in every bad movie ever his genius is that he is able to orchestrate this knowledge into masterpieces of cult cinema with expert precision and cleverness also he manages to make it all even the most violent material palatable to the mainstream public that alone is genius after six years off im glad to see that the master is back with all of the crap out there weve missed him and needed him,cruel
the first time i heard about or knew anything about it was when i bought the gangs of new york dvd and watched the sneak peeks popped up and i decided to click on that what i saw was a preview for a mind boggling action film from my favorite directorscreenwriter quentin tarantino i was convinced that the 4th tarantino film would be the world war ii film the inglorious bastards since last i heard of him he was still working on the screenplay was a mighty surprise for all tarantino fans i saw on october 10th at 430 the first show to be shown at our theater i even took off work to see it seeing uma thurman as bluuoop or the bride as they call her reprising her role in a tarantino film since 1994 got me so excited since pulp fiction is one of my all time favorite movies the references in showed how dedicated tarantino was to this and the rest of his films pulp fiction fans will roar with laughter once they see the things that tarantino snuck into when you see the bride walk though the tokyo airport you see an advertisement for red apple cigarettes the same brand bruce willis bought at the bar in pulp fiction and the relation between the brides secret organization divas deadly viper assassination squad compared to fox force five uma thurmans character in pulp fiction starred in a pilot tv show with this namewill bring joy to all fans of tarantinos workstarantino is back with an amazing action flick a great cast and a brilliant screenplay and this is my favorite movie of the year my rating 1010,cruel
after seeing twice now i can honestly say that tarantino is one of the most talented directors in hollywood todaythe film just works  it is one of the most entertaining films i have seen so far this year  ill tell you what watching was also fun  this was a fun movie loaded with great music and lots of references to how movies were made some 2030 years agospoiler alertone of the biggest kicks i got out of watching was some of the little things that were strewn throughout the movie  these little things were references to how movies were made in the 70s references to action heroes of the 70s references to styles in the 70s references to bad music scores in the 70s and references to bad special effects in the 70sthere was one scene where the bride was pushing her way through a parking garage looking for the yeah wagon for those of you who have seen you know what i am talking about  there was this really bad 70s tune playing  you know the generic 70s track that goes along with some action related moment in a 70s action film  the shot is then cut in a really bad edit from the bride wheeling her way through the parking garage to the inside of the  wagon  that bad 70s track i told you about comes to an abrupt end  i mean the track is just cut off in mid tempo  i cant tell you how many times i have seen this same kind of edit not done on purpose mind you in some of the 70s action films i have seen  too me that was just funthere was another fun scene where the bride is in an airplane  there is a shot of the plane flying through the skies  it clearly looks like a phony special effect  how many times have you watched an old movie that has a special effect of a ufo or airplane flying through the skies which is attached to black thread  it was hilariousi also thought that the movie was very well acted  none of these characters seemed to wink at the audience  whatever was happening in their world was very real  tarantino was doing all the winking but the actors were very serious  i really got into the story and could understand why the bride was bent on revengeis a simple story with a simply plot but tarantino has a way that he tells this story which makes it really interesting and fun to watch just you wait and see other directors will try and copy this film and its stylethis is a fun movie folks  it reminds me why we go to the movies  i anxiously await vol 2,cruel
in a year thats consistently dissapointed me matrix reloaded underworld lxg just to name a few i went into this movie with relatively low expectations i wasnt overly impressed with jackie brown so that probably added to my pessimism  however in the end what i experienced was 2 hours of the best cinema this year hell the best cinema in years  presented in shawscope spouting references to star trek filled with anime pussy wagons and uma thurmans stunningly green eyes i was presented with the best movie all yearor have i already said that ive seen it twice in 3 days and now ill watch it a third time  thank you quentin for restoring my faith in movies,cruel
it must have been great to be a serious moviegoer in the 70s alien apocalypse now badlands chinatown dog day afternoon the deer hunter deliverance the godfather jaws mean streets one flew over the cuckoos nest papillon star wars and taxi driver all hitting the screens serving up something creative fresh and inspiring whilst audiences these days are subjected to remakes sequels many of which leave a bitter taste and effects driven movies where even some pornography has more plot and dialogue  so when a film like comes along you make a point of seeing it especially when maverickdirector quentin tarantino is at the helm in his forth and easily his most ambitious venture behind the lens audiences are treated to what tarantino himself describes as his grindhouse epic a film which ricochets through a wide range of genres such as kungfu spaghetti western hong kong action yakuza gangster thriller japanese anime and theatrical samurai saga any wonder it was chopped into two parts uma thurman stars as the bride formerly a key member of the elite viper assassination squad headed by the mysterious bill david carradine when she attempts to break free and start a new life her plans come crashing to a halt when her former colleagues lucy liu michael madsen daryl hannah and vivica a fox show up at her wedding and slaughter everyone in sight they leave the bride and her unborn child for dead not realising that they have only put her in a coma four years later when she comes to she seeks a bloody revenge and hell hath no fury like a woman scorned her ultimate goal being  to nancy sinatra sings bang bang i hit the ground bang bang that awful sound bang bang my baby shot me down as the opening credits role and watching the screen intently i find it hard to believe that nearly six years have passed since tarantino has released a film so was it worth the wait absolutely will divide audiences like a civil war with the word violence a major player more blood is witnessed on screen than in any other mainstream movie ive ever seen but you can take it or leave itand if you were happy to name drop qt after the success of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but didnt get his 97 adaptation of elmore leonards rum punch the film that became jackie brown  then may not be your thing with the pop culture references and the witty repartee taking a back seat in volume 1 miramax big man harvey weinstein should be congratulated for giving his full blessing to this project and quentin tarantino deserves even more recognition for his artistic merit and brilliant work here i sincerely hope his critics do as is suggested earlier take it or leave it when clockwork orange was released in the 70s it was easily the bravest film to come out of a major studio then came oliver stones natural born killers in 94 an early tarantino script in stones film woody harrelsons mass mudering character mickey knox tells the press as hes about to have his day in court you aint seen nothin yet until you see volume 1 you havent five very big stars,cruel
this movie was great  i cant believe that someone didnt like it  the way in which this movie was filmed the use of visual imagery and the overall storytelling is amazing  tarantino more than redeemed himself for jackie brown  not to mention i spent some time in japan  he really captures the culture and i was truly engrossed by this movie  next to reservoir dogs its his best work,cruel
quentin tarantino has once again solidified himself as one of the elite directors in recent history this is an amazing movie from many aspects most notably the incorporation of old style bmovies and kung fu movies into this film it is by design that this movie is over the top and nottoorealistic and thats the genius behind the movie is pure action done very stylishly and visually appealing we will not see the true genius behind volume 1 until volume 2 is released then the masterpiece will be completed and we will see what tarantinos method truly is for this filmthe only sour note i have to report is the musical score in some parts it is terrific and sets the mood perfectly but in other parts the choice in music can ruin the scene and leave you wondering why he put that song in that spot of the movie oh well everybody makes mistakes and qt is aloud to make them,cruel
i felt that volume one was one of the most unique films i have ever seen tarantino has really branched out as a director and this is only his fourth film though it is violent it is still a tarantino movie to quote him you do not go to a metallica concert and tell them to turn it down viewers know exactly what to expect from him so why in the world are there so many complaining tarantino is a great filmmaker and a very unique story telleri can not wait to see what else he has in store for us for years to come,cruel
here herethat feeling i got when watching matrix the first onelets not even delve into what i felt for the second was this tickle in the spine i knew right there and then i was watching something that was amazing and would be remembered for a long time i looked on in amazement of the shots the angles the effects etc this same feeling doesnt come along often and it reminds you why you go to see movies or make them if youre anything like me ive got that tingle only a couple of times but when you do any film lover knows what im talking about here you know its a classic film youre lucky enough to be watching remember the feeling in fight club when tylers real persona was revealed in clockwork orange in apocalypse now when the helicopters fly over in the opening sequence of citizen kane in the godfather we all have those momentsnow to the film either gave you that feeling or it didnt or wontpersonally like anyone cares about my opinion i knew it was  at the very least  something special when i realised i was on the edge of my seat during the daring and shocking fight sequences during the matrix reloaded i was shock horror actully bored with the films fight scenes they seemed to be involved to much within themselves and this is the crux they forget about the audience watching whether you liked or not is irrelevent okay it does matter a little but you have to respect the use of the art  that is film  to engage the audience so well tarantino respects the audience hes been watching countless films so its only expected and this is why so many people respect him i wont describe how he does it so effortlessly in as you really have to see it for yourself but rest assured some people wont like and some will fall in love please see this film and decide for yourself even to see how film can be used to engage the audience so welli only hope that you fall into the latter and that you are lucky enough to get that tingle in the spine all over againhave a good one,cruel
as much as i enjoyed the first time i saw it i enjoyed it exponentially more on second viewing  this is a movie that shows us the road to revenge in its most straightforward but its never been brought to the screen more effectively than in this film  every single aspect of filmmaking has come together under the genius direction of mr tarantino to create a unique compelling stylish vision of this world  its a world im glad im not in i cant even wield a sword in a videogame without cutting myself on the controller but one that nonetheless draws you and quarters dices and minces you into pulpy submission  this is more pulp fiction than pulp fiction more doggish and rugged than reservoir dogs and well more brown than ms jackie sorry i hadnt one for that  its the most thoroughly enjoyable film if youve a somewhat strong stomach of mr ts four and i imagine will go down in the annals of cool movie history whew what itd be like to hack the limbs off of 88 people at the same time all the while sporting a playful yellow jumpsuit perfect for showing off blood and entrail stains  its utter craziness but regardless a collection of incredibly cool scenes that set the tone perfectly for the next film if that werent the case i might well have ranked this to be my favorite film of the year but i still feel somewhat cheated by the sliced in half concept of volumes 1 and 2  cant wait for february though,cruel
just magnificent  tarantino has done it again  in my opinion the best of the four movies made so farinspired casting  uma was terrific the voice and presence of david carradine outstandinglucy liu superbcant say enough great things10 out of 10,cruel
whilst quentin tarantino is undeniably masterful at forming the shorthand of cinema into stunning imagery and unique characterization his adolescent preoccupation with misogynistic violence has become both wearisome and troublingas an auteur tarantino quite rightly has complete artistic freedom but his own ability to sift the postmodern references in his work isnt matched by that of his core audience who are no doubt comfortable with the familiarity of the computer game violence pithy dialogue and mtv promo wrappingits interesting that jackie brown is described by tarantino fans as his most disappointing work  could this be because grier and forsters characters were the directors most sympathetic and mature yet,cruel
i thought mr tarantino did a really good job i am one to not like these action movies like charlies angels etc where everyone can do impossible jumps and flips but this movie was funny yet dramatic tarantino has a way of making movies with work like by using strange songs or weird camera angles i love this man he is a genious and the movie in my opinion is phenominal and beautifully made i give a bunch of starsps soundtrack kicks ass,cruel
this is the 2nd best film i have ever seen since year 2000 the music is undoubtedly excellent and the beautiful photography make the film a definitely success being rated category iii is correct the film is very bloody and violent director quentin did an incredible  perfect magic making the film full of exciting plots particulary the beginning it is unbeliveable intense dont miss the beginning part it is near perfect except it is extreme violentthe only critic is that the main plotline  to revenge is directly copied from my no 1 classic  memento quentin cannot override this classic plot as in memento except this this film is sure to become a new classic in this century,cruel
never has there been such silliness looking so stylish i must admit it gripped me most of the time a schlocky tabloid masterpiece tarentinos violence is stylised cartoonish which adds so much to the whole insane enterprise but what craft there is here the black silhouttes against the blue background in the house of blue leaves the last swordfight in the drifting snow its exhilarating,cruel
man i just watched and i think its one of the best tarantino movieswell he never made really bad movies but is a very special oneits a perfect mix of brutality and story a perfect work from mister tarantino the end rocks tooi will watch it again in cinema to get the right sound and feelingsorry for my bad english greetz,cruel
ill never trust those awards again  this has to be one of the greatest movie of all time  for those who complained about the excessiveness of the blood it is precisely the excessiveness of the blood in the movie that made it campy silly and fun  i for one has never been a big fan of the gory hack and slash genre i hated nightmare on elm street friday the 13thetc  but is done with such style that made it tolerable and even poetici think people who complained about the excessive violence might have taken the movie a bit too seriously  honestly i dont believe for a minute that human blood gushes like a geyser when one of the limb get severed  i think its this unrealistic overdone that made the mood so fantasticali do find one flaw in the logic of the movie though  the way oren ishii died  i know for a fact that people have survived worse injuries  so she could not possibly have died from thati think qt has really outdone himself this time  i think people who complained about the movie might change their mind after watching this movie a few more times later on  i for one actually walked out in the middle of pulp fiction thinking that it was one of the stupidest movie ive ever seen only to find it to be one of the most enjoyable movie later on when i watched it again and again and againin my humble opinion everything in this movie is done perfectly  the music is simply divine  the scenaries the costumes the characters the choreographies the scriptetcas an avid movie goer i watch about 4  7 movies in theatres a week and owning at least 200 some dvds  my family used to own several video stores is one of those rare film that left me wanting more and thank qt there will be more,cruel
there hasnt been a better movie in the past 4 years period perfect soundtrack unique and just perfect for the film perfect story straight simple and done in perfection perfect photography no one could have done better perfect in any way 1010can only be beaten by vol 2 but it sounds like blasphemy to say that this film can ever be beaten by another,cruel
minor spoilerfirst of all im not a big fan of qt  yes i like dogs and lesser fiction but this has put him up there in my books finally someone has captured all the great things from spag westernsmartial arts and manga and put it all together into a great movieor two it is truly a stylish movie with great directing and camera worksadly the two main things that lack in most of the genre films that qt has drawn from this movie is not meant to be a dialog master piece but a straight out action style movie with real style i hear people going on about the blood and violence but this is spot on to what manga etc are like and the very nice black and white action scene was amazing  i mean using what i think looks like water for blood as we all know blood would be black what pure magic it was nasty in some places but that as i said is the genre and it but compare it to most rubbish movies out there ie resident evil it doesnt rely on the blood and no guts to make people go see the movie for pure shock value  but i think some people will go just see it because of the fuss made for me the story did drive along with the action so well that i was most upset over the fact ive got to wait several months to see part two finally its great to see a movie that delivers everything i expected and more  for onceto all the people who didnt like it see a pile of manga  sergio leone kurusawas movies and see again  then youll see the lighti hope,cruel
im usually the one to find whatever is wrong with a movie and the only thing bad about this movie is uma thurman has ugly feet is the most amazing experience you will ever have in a movie theater uma thurman did an amazing job and quentin tarantino is still on top 10 years later this guy is a freak of nature go see it now hey i said now,cruel
i didnt know what to expect of this movie while sitting there and watching the upcoming movie snippets when it came on and nancy sinatras bang bang came on i knew i was in for a good time money well spent the plot was genius and the action and acting were brilliant the gore was a nice feel to the film for me to ultimately grasp the idea behind it very nice quinton cant wait for vol 2,cruel
this film had everthing that i wanted in a kung fu movie  it had witty dialogue great fights and one of the hottest woman in the world slicing and dicing  the use of chapters made this movie flow well quentin has really out done himself  this should prove all of you naysayers wrong he is not a one trick pony  i am sure i will be like the rest of you and will be one of the first in line to see vol 2,cruel
is an interesting film in that its in a genre i consider a guilty pleasure yet many other people consider incredibly stupid or without merit until a name writer  director does it then it is valid to enjoy if qt wasnt attached to this project there would not be the cry of art that seems to surround incredibly brutal in parts sometimes tinged with black humour is an experience i enjoyed very much but will need to see the conclusion before being able to decide exactly what to think of this movie at the moment it is certainly not a masterpiece personally it is more like a rollercoaster  thrilling shocking enjoyable  but hardly high artfor all its fans this movie is just another blockbuster albeit done with style qts talents at framing scenes is working perfectly and there are some very memorable moments but its a martial arts film for all the talk of homages and referencing there isnt any real soul to this movie you get on enjoy the ride and get off not once stopping to think about the greater ramifications of iti am certainly looking forward to seeing volume 2 lets hope it is worth the noise that has surrounded the decision to split it,cruel
is a very intriguing film with largely female driven action it could best be described as the female equivalent of mel gibsons 1999 film payback done as a quentin tarantino film  interestingly lucy liu is attached to both projects  i recommend seeing this film but dont bring the kids and look the other way during the blood letting scenes,cruel
for all the complaints ive read all i can say is this movie isnt for them if they dont like its off the wall style yes there is prolly more blood and gore in this movie than any other movie ive seen but its all done in good fun one of the best movies ive seen im pleased to have seen it in the theater rather than on dvdvhs,cruel
theres something not quite perfect about  for the first hour i went back and forth between liking it and not liking it especially between the first fight scene which is wonderful especially when the school bus appears and the anime sequence  the movie is missing something in that spacemaybe its too slowly paced or takes too much time explaining a plot that is so simple it could be explained in 5 secondsbut starting with the anime sequence was unflappable  so much of this film is a homage to other films and yet it manages to be one of the most original films ive seen in years  the images and music in some scenes such as the final swordfight in the snow are simply beautiful exquisite even  and even the minor characters such as the sushi chef and the texas sheriff are interesting people you want to know more about it is violent and bloody  most of the blood is so overthetop its just a geyser of red and not very disturbing  but some of it is disturbing and although ive seen much more gory movies like dead alivebraindead and day of the dead i actually wish had toned it down a touch  its so bloody that many people have focused only on that aspect of the film which is a shamehas moments that are among the best ever filmed but i dont think the film as a whole is as good as pulp fiction  i give it 910,cruel
i have for a long time been skeptical of whether quentin tarantino was a worthwhile talent certainly pulp fiction was a seminal film of the 1990s for better or worse and reservoir dogs and jackie brown were at least worthwhile but it was my burgeoning opinion that his style of goofy selfreferential filmmaking was already irrelevant and that the cinema even american cinema had moved beyond anything he could accomplish and watching vol 1 i realized pretty quickly that i was absolutely correct with a new crop of young protoauteurs that has been born since qt made jackie brown in 1997 seems awfully trite i predicted a while back that if tarantino didnt make a masterpiece this time around it would be the end of him well now i think i was wrong about that is far far far from a masterpiece but its not a disaster its somewhat mediocre but entertaining enough that i will see its second installment and the fact that it comes in two parts doesnt annoy me at all in fact as i believed it would it ends very well and probably the next movie tarantino decides to make as for the film its all style no substance i spent most of the movie wondering whether i liked it or not and there was plenty in the film that i didnt like the story is very poor not compelling in the least and the characters are dreadful the pacing is way too slow and the dialogue is extremely awkward at times but the action sequences are fun if too bloody im not that big a fan of violence to tell you the truth i very unfortunately had to go to the bathroom during the longest action sequence i dont think i will ever see this movie again but i might just to see everything in that balletic mele but what tipped me over from dislike into indifference was mostly the technical stuff the costume design is fabulous as are the cinematography and music and the production design is some of the best ive seen a shoo in for an oscar nomination some of the editing during the fight sequences was annoying this certainly doesnt compare to real martial arts movies so the shaw brothers logo at the films opening is a huge tease but a lot of it was very good too while the shifting in time wasnt necessary it worked well what pushed me from indifference into approval was the animated sequence it is the only exceptional thing in the film it reminded me a lot of peter chungs work he created aeon flux which is perhaps the greatest work of animation in the last decade this sequence seemed particularly influenced by the silent aeon flux cartoons from liquid television but my theatergoing companions did not allow me to stick around and watch the full of the credits i did see that it was animated in tokyo but any other info would be much appreciated so in full is very worthwhile hardly great id already call it extremely overrated  some of the reviews i read last week i find a bit embarrassing but a decent sunday afternoon entertainment you might even want to wait for dvd as youll most likely get to see both installments as one long film although i have doubts that it would even work as one movie considering that this first part is nearly two hours long as it is 710,cruel
the oscars can say whatever they want but is the best movie of 2003 its a total movie a work of art that could never be realized in any other medium reservoir dogs and pulp fiction would have worked as novels though no prizes for guessing which kind and jackie brown was adapted from one theres an immediacy to it rarely matched elsewhere  one brilliant conceived setpiece rapidly follows another after another quentin tarantino knows how brilliant he is and is not afraid to show it making narrative leaps other directors would retract into the fetal position just contemplatingcase in point the samurai swords i cant imagine anybody in japan uses samurai swords as practical weapons anymore to say nothing of their being the weapon of choice for the yakuza tarantino overcomes this logistical roadblock by totally ignoring it and after the climactic fight scene lasting probably twenty minutes and with more thrills and intense choreography than the matrix reloaded could ever dream of were more than happy to let it goive always felt there is an art to the integration of pop music into a movie by skillful editing but its been grievously weakened by its poorlyconceived overuse in recent years the credo seems to be that faster and more chaotic is better and the tone of the piece isnt as important tarantino knows better exercising the same brilliance in picking tunes and editing the movie around them that helped pulp fiction be as great as it waseven the smallest touches are masterful  coppolas oranges have nothing on tarantinos breakfast cereal uma thurman for her part dominates the screen in a performance thats far more difficult that it looks and speaking of difficult  dont even get me started on waiting for volume two,cruel
there were so many action sequences in that i was nearly comatose at the end in and of itself this movie is not much better than movies made from video games i despaired when the army of 88 took stage and i was really ready for volume one to be over i am going to see volume two and hope for the best it really has its work cut out volume one is a stylish flop,cruel
this movie is 1 great fun 2 great art 3 distinctly tarantino its not necessary to have a working knowledge of 70s kung fu movies to enjoy but it helps tarintinos hand is obvious but only in the best possible way wellwritten dialog interesting camera angles artistic production additions wellplayed scenesi saw this movie on friday saturday and may go again today is this his best film i cant say that tarantinos films are all great in their own way and i dont really think they compete against each other ill say this tarantino fans will not be disappointed but casual moviegoers who dont understand tarintinos art probably will be10 out of 10steve,cruel
quentin tarantinos previous big hitters reservoir dogs and pulp fiction confirmed his status as an innovative writerdirector who isnt afraid to challenge the standard normquite simply vol1 explodes onto the screen and proves that the maestro qt himself has plenty of petrol in the tankwhilst simple in its story strengths lie in the visuals and it delivers uma thurman is simply amazing as the bride who seeks revengefor all that1010roll vol 2,cruel
after the film i left the cinema on the same sort high i experienced with lord of the rings and the matrix its quite simply an exercise in violence and cool and i have no problem when its this sharp making a true mockery of the cgi fights which dog most films tarantino has made a truly outstanding action film which is what it is regardless of what most would say we just dont seem to notice it because it lacks a car chase which lasts a half hour a pumping soundtrack and ludicrous wardrobe i imagine a small minority of tarantino fans will hate it with passion because tarantino has moved on from his roots into new exciting genres not that the man himself will care im more than happy to see him broaden his palette the performances are spot on despite criticism the soundtrack is next on my shopping list and the direction is sublime a neat anime back story in the middle brilliant and numerous moments of black humor combined with lightening fast swordplay rises above every other film ive seen in the cinema this year i cant wait to see how tarantino tackles the war genre but most of all i look forward to volume 2 the choice to split the film in two is still a mystery as i could have easily watched another hour and half but its something to look forward too another masterpiece in the can id say,cruel
note  the comments for this movie may contains spoilers so you have been warned     after a long hiatus mr tarantino created a beautiful masterpiece entitled volume one that pays homage to the 1970s and martial movies in general  the beginning when it showed the shaw brothers logo was simply wonderful       the story is about a former assassin uma thurman who is left for dead by her former cohorts and put in a coma  she wakes from her coma four years later and goes on a revenge spree on each member of her former assassin team that left her for dead  miss thurman locates her second victim vivica a fox and kills her with her child watching the entire scenario  then miss thurman in flashback sequence kills her first victim lucy liu  at the end of this great movie bill david carradine informs one of his associates that the brides thurman child is still alive     this movie has it all comedy action and a great anime sequence that tells the origin of lucy lius character  the anime was simply realistically done to a perfect tee  also mr tarantino uses a lot of 70s references like the theme to ironside and shaw brothers logo  this movie has to be one of the bloodiest in cinema history but its more comical than horror       the dark gengar gives this movie from one gengar to ten gengars ten gengars   plus the soundtrack has a very eerie cut that was used in the opening of this movie which was done by nancy sinatra and overall good enjoy the movies and aloha from one to all,cruel
sure it looks great and the action scenes are very well done and well shot  but the dialogue is appalling  for one thing the women arent terribly believable in their roles  especially lucy liu she isnt believable as a villian at all  uma thurman is a great actress but her part isnt written very well  the best part of the movie is the anime sequence theres much more emotion in that then there is in the live action stuff the writing here is not nearly as good as pulp fiction or resevoir dogs5 out of 10,cruel
words cannot describe this movie this is tarantinos 4th film and its probably one of his best its performances are oscar worthy and the whole movie is sublime every scene keeps you on the edge of your seat a must see for any movie watcher what is even better is that this is only volume 1 volume 2 is released early next year and i dont care that people are complaining that this movie is in two parts this means twice the entertainment and excitement 1010,cruel
excellent direction by his excellency very great mr quentin tarantinoexcellent work by her excellency very great madame uma thurmanand her excellency very great madame lucy liulast scene is just beautifulblood fountains are very impressiveviolence at its bestoverall rating athanks and regardssam rupanihouston texas united states of america,cruel
that little summary phrase is japanese for extremely awesome  this movie proves yet again how talented a director and writer quentin tarantino really is  the previews for the movie do an excellent job of keeping people in the dark about the most of the movie and ill try to do the same  basically centers on the bride uma thurmanand her quest for revenge she was an assassin betrayed by her former comrades  this movie is full of action  in fact its quite refreshing to see such an actionpacked movie that relies very little if at all on firearms  the special effects may not seem to be stateoftheart youll see what i mean but i beseech you to disregard such vain things  theres much much more to the movie than the violence and action  unlike most action movies the plot proves itself quite riveting  the twists and turns while most movies have them mask themselves so well and when they finally do make themselves known they do so in a surprising manner  being only volume 1 of a twopart franchise i eagerly anticipate volume 2s february release  i cant say in good faith that this is my favorite tarantino film as im a sucker for the land of the rising sun  but vol 1 is an excellent comeback after a fouryear hiatus of tarantino films  i give it a ten out of ten,cruel
is a masterpiece stylistic brilliance at its absolute best that is what is all about  style if you can appreciate its attention to style then you will love it if you cant then you will most probably see it as a shallow excessively violent slashfest tarantino has fashioned every small part of this film to work together in the same artistic direction and the result is phenomenal it was tied up nicely too so to not feel like an abrupt cleavage of another film it is definitely a worthwhile feature in its own right has my highest recommendation,cruel
never before have i given a film a 10 rating until i saw this one  this film is absolutely perfect  quentin tarantino has created a masterpiece a combination of many genres that captivate your sensesthe woman with no name the bride uma thurman deserves an academy award for her role in this film and tarantino deserves an academy award for his majestic writing and directing including the sound and musical score there is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as being one of the best films ever maderesistance is futile ancient borg proclamation,cruel
pretty typical tarantino fare as far as content violence excessive bloodshed is there such a thing  extreme theatrics largerthanlife characters and cool music umwell except for the gogo rock at the restaurant but even that had an interesting effect on the scenethe bride was definitely as cool as el mariachi but maybe i only say that because im a chick shrug oren ishii was a total badass and gogo was one of the awesomest psychos ever  once again tarantino delivers a starstudded cast as well uma thurman lucy liu david carradine sonny chibathe plot is great and out of order again a la pulp fiction  i liked that we got to see what kind of person the bride was it was not my intention for you to witness that right off the bat  it was great how we were shown where oren came from and why the bride was so torqued it made them into compelling characters and made their final fight almost but not quite poignantgood cinematography too definitely liked the shadowfight as well as the black and white segmentsone thing  did anyone else notice that everybody on the plane had a katana  isnt that justweird  cough cough like the dancing in pulp fiction wasntany fan of action films andor tarantinos work will love this movie  the only problem  the second one isnt out yet,cruel
ive never done heroin but i imagine that first hit the one that gets you hooked feels a bit like how i felt watching the massacre at the end of vol 1i was skeptical as a big qt fan i felt six years was too long to wait and i really didnt believe the anticipation and the hype would be rewarded with a great movie i was expecting merely a good movie and for qt good isnt good enough luckily he knows this and instead he delivered what is if not his best film certainly his most energetic exciting stylised and downright fun filmtheres been a lot of dissing of qts motives with this movie the hyperstylised look of the film has been criticised as too fanboy centric this is a good point but its certainly no more so than robert rodriguezs desperado or the coens blood simple and i dont remember anyone accusing those of being fanboy movieswhatever your take on the movie you surely have to admire the mans technical ability and sheer audacity the tea house battle that ends the movie is a masterpiece a real example of the ballet of violence that john woo fans have always lovedi did get the feeling from the crowd i saw it with that many were not sure what they were watching crouching tiger this most definitely was not pulp fiction is was not hell even dusk til dawn it was not this was unlike anything qt has ever done and for that alone he should be applauded on the release of jackie brown many critics had decided that he had run his course and he couldnt do anything else well is the samurai sword up the arse to those who believed thatanyone who loves cinema should see this movie i wont say that everyone will love it but it has everything that hollywood has forgotten how to do a good story adrenaline pumping action and a sense of awe remember how you felt when you first saw star wars the imperial destroyer roaring over your head or when indiana jones was being chased by a giant boulder that kind of excitement is captured here as hordes of katomasked villains fall at umas sword or the sight of legendary sonny chiba bestowing on her the sword that could cut godthankfully the pop culture references that were his trademark have been toned down unfortunately theyve been replaced with an almost airplanestyle desire to reference other movies and tv shows its nice when it works ironside music quotes from eaten alive im buck and here to f even the girl from battle royale wearing the same costume as she did in that movie but there is the potential danger for it all to become a little selfparodying something most definately is notsee it and regain your faith in cinema,cruel
as a movie theatre manager i see tons of films  top is the best ive seen in i dont know how long  it tops everything tarantinos done to date the writing fight choreography  gore are brilliant  tarantino at his most stylish  cheeky  another perfect soundtrack too  the only thing i dont like is having to wait until february to see it concluded,cruel
will hopefully be err hang on how does that goas a standalone film this doesnt work for me its fairly entertaining but goes nowhere a revenge film with huge amounts of deathdealing but the whole tapestry is left unfinished and weve only seen a few threads hopefully when the second volume comes out it will come togethermuch as i cant stand tarantino as a person not that ive met him i just imagine from the interviews ive seen that hes one of the most annoying people on the planet i think hes a pretty good craftsman in this industry hes certainly thrown a few good scenes in here but there are a few things that are jarring like the anime and the black and whiteanother reviewer mentioned the sherrifs sunglasses as an example of tarantinos depth every character is thought out in great detail the way i see that is that tarantino finds it impossible to be subtle if it were a throwaway moment fine but its right in our faces and then for good measure the deputy is the sherrifs son why isnt he out looking for the banditthe cast was great and the soundtrack excellent but ill give this a 7 until i see the whole thing,cruel
whether or not you appreciate this genre you must see this film  qt has created a film of a unique genre for everyone  those who love the genre will plotz  those who hate the genre will leave smiling  those unfamiliar with the genre will learn more  this is an extremely high quality production with refined qt shots angles and ages between cuts  the action is great and largely believable  there is as always qt dialogue that makes you think while you chuckle  once again a movie to respect see in the theater and purchase for your home,cruel
with the cost of seeing a film reaching an ungodly amount a film has got to be totally worth it its got to deliver and delivers in spades does this mean that its a movie you recommend to everyone no i am not going to recommend it to too many girls i know or anyone over the age of sixty five i am however going to espouse its virtues to any true lover of films is it better than any of the other three films tarantino has created its hard to say it will be easier to determine once volume 2 is released and then wait for about 10 years right now it doesnt matter because its recaptured that feeling i had when i first walked out of pulp fiction although jackie brown is my favorite by a slight margin and i did walk out of that viewing totally thrilled pulp fiction was like a drug and has that same effect i had read the screenplay when it was first online and i wish i hadnt in a way but really it didnt matter because it did not prepare me for what was on the screen this movie isalive and knowing that the best is yet to come i cant wait every positive has been talked about and touched upon by every scribe in north america so i will quickly go over the obviously great aspects of this hyper active revenge tale uma thurman  sexy as hell and fg bad ass the female charles bronson i cant understand how some people feel that her character is underwritten and undermotivated i dont get it what more do you want she was a killer she got shot in the head by her ex husband and boss her new husband and family were killed she was pregnant at the time she went into a coma where her body was peddled by a depraved orderly she wakes up to realize this little detail then realizes that she lost the kid she is super pissed and has more need for revenge than any character i can rememberthe music  this might be the greatest part of the film because it is stuck in my head like a ten inch blade i love the use of nancy sinatras bang bang the enrico marccone score is used to great effect and the one that really gets me going is the green hornet theme that plays as uma heads to tokyo it all just kicks ass go go yubari  every scene she was in she stole those eyes that face i love that little asian school girl giggle she gives as the ball and chain hit the floor like i read somewhere i think on chud she is the boba fett of the new millenium oren ishis anime backstory  unreal i love how the animation gets better as she gets better its completely involving and creates such a unique tone to the film without really taking you out of the story its  thrilling the dialogue  now alot of people are talking about how it isnt tarantinos best how there isnt enough of it and the stuff that is there seems forced or too contrived too hey look at me i dont buy it i would buy it with a critique on from dusk till dawn but not here there is no need for long witty pop culture referenced sililoques whats there is enough anyway it does serve a purpose later and you know with michael madsen there we will get a taste of some original verbiage its a different film from his others is there anything i didnt like well there are some aspects as with all great films one of them concerns her obtaining of the hanzo blade it lacked the whollup the scene as a whole was great but maybe too quick i was one of the people that didnt like the switch to black and white during the house of blue leaves battle the obvious body double didnt help and the use of the steel sometimes did not seem right these were all small details overall the film was great lucy liu was beautiful what a great character i love the little sonny chiba scene the man from okinawa but like i said it might of been too quick now to all those that bitch about the film and how its cut in two and this sucked and that sucked just wait i guarantee the next film will be unbelievable and then we can sit back and judge it as a whole and just like jacki brown people will come around tarantino is not god but he sure can make going to the movies fun as hell,cruel
 episode one here was a movie that i had been looking forward to for such a long time and what hype i personally am a huge tarentino fan i was convinced by reservoir dogs and i was completely sold and enamoured by the truly excellent pulp fiction and then later liked jackie brown but not anywhere near the level of the others and now here is the fourth of his films or at least the first part of itafter watching it i sat there thinking this movie has not let me down one bit and i simply cannot believe how it delivered exactly what it said on the poster  a roaring rampage of revenge if anyone comes out of the cinema and claims that all it was was about killing firstly they would have missed all the undertones and issues that were present and displayed in a number of superb ways including anime and secondly next time read the poster before you go infrom the sweet singing sound of the samurai blade being pulled out of the sheath by the master that crafted it to the superb perfectly choreographed fights to the sensational dialogue i can say that the only thing wrong with is that i know for a fact that when episode 2 finishes i will be dying for more i am glad that tarentino is likely to do an anime prelude because in all honesty i cant get enough of these characters and this fantasy scenariobut the main thing is  it is not just some movie with lots of deaths that is just a good laugh to watch it manages to supercede even pulp fiction in the simple fact that what is created on screen just makes you bite your tongue and love every second that the film drips out well pulp fiction managed to do that too but mix that with a great andrenalin rush and theres with classic salutes to so many genres from westerns to classic 70s martial arts to so many other things i get the feeling that this film will be especially special for those that really love the kung fu martial art movies of old and yes i did grow up on films like snake in the shadow of the monkeyand then theres the anime  beautifully drawn and haunting in its execution of the emotional issues the music is superb and is a part and parcel of the fights to create a sensational experience ahh this can go on and on in truth this film is simply a masterpiece and one i will be seeing countless times again what can i say just like the razor sharp hattori hanzo blade the movie manages to inspire me and drive me and i could sit there for houts watching it with its monumental soundtrackbah this is too much go watch it for heavens sake and see what the fuss is about simply one of the best films by one of the top film makers ever 1010,cruel
what a wonderful way to welcome fall after all the bombs and disappointments ive seen this past summer ive only seen two really good movies the whole entire year and this was one of them the other was finding nemo,cruel
spoilers being a fan of tarantino and pulp fiction i had been eagerly awaiting for months  maybe my expectations were too high because when the movie was over i was disappointed fist of legend 1994 is still the standard by which i compare all other martial arts movies to and although the tone of is different it doesnt hold up like his previous films tarantino uses nonlinear storytelling a technique that became so prevalent during late nineties  a straightforward narrative would have been more appropriate for this revenge epic as many other people have commented is all style and no substance  character development is one tarantinos strengths but theres barely any of it here  in fact the character with the most depth is oren ishii whose background is told through a beautifully animated sequence but so what  all that information that we learn about her serves no purpose and is negated because shes killed off at the end of the movie although the fight choreography by yuen wooping is good it doesnt compare to his previous efforts like snake in eagles shadow fist of legend or tai chi master  the finish to each big fight is anticlimatic vernita green got a knife thrown into her heart  go go got a board with nails stuck in her head and oren ishii got the top of her head lopped off for three villains that were supposedly lethal assassins they died like chumps as it stands i can only give a 610,cruel
when it comes to alcohol absinthe comes in two main varieties distilled which is the purer form and mixed and macerated where the additional herbal ingredients are blended after the distilling process  in general pure distilled absinthe is both more palatable and more effectivea master distiller of any intoxicating beverage draws on tradition and experiments to not only pay tribute to that past but to give the world his own creation to leave his markis a heady mixture of pure action drawing on numerous inspirations blended to perfection and distilled onto film  from an unlikely mix of anime spaghetti westerns and grindhouse comes a concoction in which each ingredient can be tasted and identified on sampling but the sum is what makes it unique and more than its partsat the same time it is infused with tarantinos unique brand of humour and emotion  the liquid flows freely from the screen to the bloodstream leaving one both intoxicated and wanting more by the endthe more familiar you are with the ingredients at work here the more youll appreciate the fine blending techniques that tarantino has used to achieve the end result  even if you arent familiar with any of the genres at work maybe a taste of will whet your appetite for more as there is a reason tarantino is paying tribute to this stuff  if you want to know the history behind it id suggest looking at the imdb message board with all the reference being listedits not a drink for everyone and most definitely an acquired taste but if you dont try it youll never know  and that would be the biggest shame,cruel
wow its been awhile since ive been blown away after watching a movie after his hiatus im glad to see quentin hasnt lost his touch this movie is definitely for the openminded the carnage that is in this movie was amazing im glad that quentin is giving props to the asian culture go sonny chiba oh and gogo looks like a japanese uma to me anyways i cant wait for vol2 i wouldnt be surprised if this movie gets snubbed in the awards shows except the mtv movie awards i really hope that the rumors of quentin wanting to do a us remake of battle royale is true i think only he could do it justice,cruel
a very long wait but once again tarantino the man has deliveredevery single one of his movies have been brilliant with pulp fiction and reservoir dogs setting standards i really didnt know what to expect when he moved towards the action genre but after seeing the movie  booked in advance  i realised that the film is in a genre of its own i dont believe i have seen a film quite like this for a very long timewhat impressed me about the film is the audacity tarantino had not only the way he had written it but also some of the beautiful directions in the film most directors these days have forgotten why and for whom they are making movies throughout the film it is clear to see tarantino has kept the viewers eyes in his mind he shot it in a way that will intrigue the viewer throughout a lot of directors these days have ignored the viewers and have been directing in a way they feel is good enough hence a lot of bad moviesi loved the music he used and would like to give praise to those who worked on the soundtrack  score im downloading it as we speak  but ill also buy it so dont get mad at me for downloading robert richardson cinematography must also be given credita fantastic film by a genius geeki would recommend the film to anyone overage who loves movies but who isnt easily shockedpeace  loveps make sure you watch it and vote honestly,cruel
quentin tarantino is to cinema as the who is to music  while you can call their works art the truth is both are entertainers who concentrate on creating things that they like to seehear  quentin tarantino is really nothing more complex than the worlds biggest quentin tarantino fan  that is not a negative  i too am a big tarantino fanone thing i found interesting is there is a children motif in umas character starts the film pregnant lucy luis character endures unspeakable horrors in her youth gogo is only 17 and already a worldclass killer and viveca a foxs child is left alive to perhaps avenge her mother somedayperhaps the greatest twist is that will at least be nominated for many technical oscars even though the film and sound editing are at times deliberately bad,cruel
first things first if you loved those old 60s and 70s kungfu flick you will in all likelihood love this movie if you hate those type of movies you may hate this moviewith that out of the way tarantino beautifully takes memorable scenes from classic movies and gives it a tarantino twist scene and music homages range from the old black and white samurai movies from the 50s the aforementioned kungfu movies of the 70s bruce lee moviestv show classic western 70s action movies the night of the living dead sergio spaghetti westerns modern japanese anime and culture hk action operos and on and on knowledgeable viewers will love picking out the little tidbits of classic movie icons both visual and sound in this gem only tarantino can do this and make you smile unlike other directors in which viewers scoff at their lame ripoffs i loved the scenes when uma does something cool in which a corny 70s sounding bionic sound fx playsabsolutely fantasticfor the detractors of this movie see my above statement one thing viewers have to realize is that since this movie is a homage mainly to the shaw brothers and other grindhouse flicks of the 70s did you notice the intro of the movie that its going to be heavy on action and short on tarantinos usual dynamic dialogue which i missed except for the excellent scene with chibasama this movie doesnt take itself seriously and expects the audience to do the same there is a reason for the corny 70s music and sound fx it is to put the reader in the mindset that what will be seen will be overthetop and dare i saygoofy for your average western viewer for lack of a better word when i first saw glimpses of the trailer i didnt know it was a tarantino flick i knew it was going to be a actionheavy movie short on narrative obviously seeing uma wielding a samurai sword wearing a bruce lee game of death style jumpsuit surrounded by masked kato men told me that this movie was going to be a comic book style flick and in that it did not disappoint at all a great action flick from the man himself,cruel
is one of the best times ive had at the movies in a long timeis it violentyes very much sofunnyagainvery much sofor those old enough to remember the hong kong martial arts films of the 70sthis film is both a put onand homage to them,cruel
granted it is hard to follow as auspicious a beginning as this movie has opening as it does with a klingon proverb but i generally expected more from tarantino his trade mark quirky characters dialogue and scenes are almost absent from this movie and all we are left with is an above average turbo hong kong flick dont get me wrong i dig a super violent nobrainer as much as the next guy but there are a lot of guys out there who can do that with this kind of budget and after a sixyear hiatus from tarantino this is a disappointment i give it a 7 out of 10,cruel
this movie caught me by surprise i didnt really expect it to be that good i really enjoyed it and thought that it was fun it was a great send up to those kung fu flicks i am not a big quentin tarantino fan i am more of a spike lee person so i dont understand his style but he did a good job i would recommend this film to the men cause the women wouldnt be able to handle the violence and bloodshed,cruel
i havent experienced this sort of exhilaration for a long time so many memorable scenes one thing many people seem to forget is that while the impact of a play is largely determined by the performances a movie can arrest an audience through sound and images tarantino has taken the latter and riskier route here and he has one hell of a vision the marriage of the music and the editing is just breathtaking the scenes without music are just as compelling every shot seemed carefully designed edited and finetuned for maximum punch this is one movie that demonstrates the difference between a large screen and a television set,cruel
rating qt does it again with his different  brilliant style of filmmaking is not as great as pulp fiction or reservoir dogs in my view but does come close in at 3rd place for me infront of jackie brown which i still liked very much however what i do have to say is that is tarantinos best lookingsounding film in terms of visuals  sound he has once again like he did in pulp changed the order of the film which i believe makes this film even greater but what blew me away was the visual look of the film  especially the sound effects ok i watched it at leicester square with a massive screen  tons of speakers but i still feel the sound would of been excellent in a smaller cinema in the scene before uma thurman wakes from her comer a mosquito is flying about  it actually sounded like there was one in the cinema  all the sword slashing  stabbing was awsome  the gunshot uma thurman takes to the head i hope no one takes this as a spoiler as you should know she gets shot and wakes up from a coma as thats the whole point of the story was very good  made tons of people jump in the cinemame including as it seemed to come out of no where i heard it was meant to of been one of the goriest movies ever  although it was fairly gory it still isnt as bad as many people have said it is  was just like the japanese versus  was no where near as bad as the story of ricky or braindead the cast isnt as slick as tarantinos other films not as good as jackie brown which had a great cast although uma thurman was excellent bill caradine isnt seen visually in the movie well you dont see his face michael madsen  daryl hannah are barely in vol 1  vivicaa fox isnt in it much also whereas lucy lui is in it quite a bit  is the character the movie goes into the most although she didnt seem right to me in this part she had the looks but not the acting ability overall is a stunning  amazing achievement in filmmaking with a terrific ending which i wont spoil for anyone to lead to vol 2  with its fair share of gore humor  tarantino trademarks shot from car bonnet55  i cant wait for volume 2,cruel
over the past year i have been forced by my friends to watch all of tarintinos work my best friend wouldnt let it go that i hadnt seen reservoir dogs but let me tell you i am glad he did get me into tarintinolast october i remember hearing about and i could barely wait for it now a year later i had the awesome experience to see yet another masterpiece by qtnow tarintino may be a bit overrated i dont blame people for thinking that but he has every right to be especially now is the best film that i have seen in 2003 it even beat out matrix reloaded for me and thats saying a lot all throughout the film every scene just drenched with tarintinos imagination and charm to me i just saw a little boy growing up in california watching kung fu movies and now he gets all these awesome toys to make his ownsome of the acting was a little corny but that was his intention he wanted it as authentic as possible quentin tarintino has done it again and he knows just the right people to act in his films uma thurman was fantastic and hot as usual and i couldnt help but laugh at all of the awesome acting from the other cast members i eagerly wait for the next installment from quentin and the band apart gang,cruel
i will spare people the spoilers lets just say that i have seen this movie 3 times already and am going a 4th time tonight i will clarify that as a movie theater employee this was for free this is one movie however that i would gladly plunk down money for this film is the best fusion of comedy and violence i have ever seen it is at times very twisted some times poignant but practically always amusing on one hand the violence is cartoonish and so over the top so as not to be taken too seriously but on the other it seems almost as though the bride really is dispatching people at a pace that any nefarious serial killer or mass murderer would envy honestly i would have rated this movie nc17 without a second thought kudos to quentin tarantino for finagling an r rating maybe the mpaa liked it so much they gave him a pass say what you want about qts homage paying cribbing amalgamating  what have you all i know is that he has once again delivered a solid entertaining movie i think all those people bashing harvey weinstein will have to eat their words first off i think his primary reason for splitting is so tarantino could make a full movie that would not have to be cut down for time and thereby we are getting the real deal even if a big part of the reason is to increase profits so what that is mr weinsteins job after all i think it is a winwin for both audiences and miramax note to parents do not bring kids younger than age 14,cruel
when pulp fiction came out it blew peoples minds  with the way it flipped around and showed things that would happen before things that did happen was mind blowing  it had only been done once before and that was in reservoir dogs  the later did not get enough credit of publicity when it came out and if i personally had seen rd first i probably would have liked it better than pulp fiction  but i saw pulp fiction first and it completely  blew my mind to me there had never been anything like it so i was anxious to see what else then barely known quentin tarantino had done  to those who have seen and do not think it was that good i have this to say to you nothing is ever going to be pulp fiction again and tarantino just happen to make his sophomore directing effort probably the best movie he will make but is an awesome movie and deserves alot of credit just for the feel of it alone  i know i walked out wishing vol 2 was already in theaters  the movie is uniquely done and well worth the price of admission,cruel
i remember the days of watching usas kung fu theater on saturday morningafternoons and renting endless kung fu videos in the 80s with my father and best friend  the stories were all unique but had a basic formula vol1 follows the style and story of these movies characters that seem one dimensional but actually are deeper then what we have become shown in the movies as of late  we follow the bride in her journey to seek retribution against those who did her wrong on her wedding day  unlike most action movies she goes after her prey with precision patience and control  it is a delightfully rewarding film for any kung fu fan the movie has sonny chiba what else needs to be said  the soundtrack is perfection the songs chosen and the score is by rza if im not mistaken fits the movie so well and i cant remember a shot done as beautiful as the one of lucy lui and her gang walking into the japanese bar,cruel
the 4th film by quentin tarrintino and once the hype has died down you will realise how mediocre this film is  stylish yes  original yes but a boring script that lacks direction and a film that was so long it was cut into two will ultimately seal its cult statusif pulp fiction was his mona lisa then this is a fake mona lisa and a poor fake at that,cruel
alright here it goes  myself and 4 other of my friends got together on opening night to see what we have been anticipating for years  the film opens with these old logos that looked to be reused from the 1970s that set the tone and from then on i could not keep my goosebumps down  i knew that it would be a good film just because it was tarantino but it beat my expectations ten fold  during the film i looked over at one of my friends to see his reaction he looked over at me with a with his jaw dropped and we just turned back to the film  the words were not spoken but we knew how one another felt about the ridiculously amazing cinematic masterpice that we were witnessing  so i guess that is kind of my metaphor towards how much this film meant to all of us and to everyone else i have talked to about it it would have been an even better experience if my exgirlfriend wasnt sitting a few rows up on a date with some jerk  although i would have been bummed about that for a while killed my petty jealousy and fueled my desire to create plus i went back the next night to see it again is up there with some of my all time favorites along with 2001 a space odyssey dead presidents foxy brown and of course pulp fiction,cruel
i dont understand the bad comments  i can see how you might think its bad but its a tribute to like 70s asian martial arts cinemadid no one notice the paper cut outs of the city and the string on the plane  it was all just blood stimulating that you should expect from a movie like this you cant take it seriously just have to have fun with it  fyi qt is a big asian cinema fan resevoir dogs was based on city on  fire a hong kong flick with chow yun fat way back in the day,cruel
a cinematically beautiful work by tarantino without the flashy cgi effects and realistic gore that plagues contemporary film the main thing that stands out about this movie is the absolutely ridiculous amount of bloodshed  all the rather bloody gore in the film is meant entirely to be over the top and at that it succeeds  its just that the bloodshed is over the top to the point of being one of the most memorable things if not the most memorable thing about the filmwonderful camerawork extensive use of color visual irony beautiful women from darryl hannah with one eye to the jawdropping chiaki kuriyama a killer soundtrack marvelous swordplay but above all enough fake blood to fill a lake  theres even an incredibly bloody anime sequence thrown in for good measure  its entertaining enough to keep your interest but bloody enough to make you feel like showering afterwards so long as youre not too much into doppelganger as that would just continue the trend  i personally have a very active imagination and am quite open to sympathy pain so i probably wont watch this one but perhaps once more right before vol 2 comes out810  it would be 9 but you honestly dont understand how freakin bloody this film is until youve seen it,cruel
this action movie was really fun to watch because you have a wonderful cast and great action the people were great the music was great and the fighting better then everything in it uma thurman was excellent in it a beautiful  smart woman kicking bad people butts i mean you cant beat that anybody who loves really cool action movies then go see this its off the hookps  cant wait for vol2,cruel
its been a whilebut it was worth it  currently stands as my favorite movie of the year  though i must admit that i hate having to wait to the see the second halfgreat moviedont take your kids great stuffqt does indeed have the midus touch,cruel
im sorry as good as this film is the dialogue is so below par i am shocked that it was penned by the same man who wrote the snappy patter and grand soliloquies of reservoir dogs and pulp fictioni can only assume that hes either doing it on purpose in an effort to emulate the lousy subtitles of his favorite asian action films or that much of the dialogue is stolen from various sources or that he has lost his gift for it altogethercome to think of it all three reasons could be valid to a degreestill the bottom line is this the trick he was trying to pull off didnt workamazing dialogue would have catapulted this film to greatness as is it falls a wee bit short in my opinion,cruel
from the beginning to the awesome fight scene to end it well volume 1 this is just a great movie everyone has been complaining about the violence blood and gore in this movie while i wont preach about one way or another all i have to say is that its a rated r movie what do you expect while i had no problems with it some people may like anything you have to decide if the risk is worth itbut more importantly the cinematography and script is just plain awesome from the subtle nuances and tributes to hong kong kung fu films see if you notice the bruce lee homage for example the influence of anime the humorous dialogue and most importantly the emphasis on the samurai code makes this beyond just an awesome action movieif you take the time to see whats going on outside the great fight scenes youll have that better of an experience but if you want just the great action see it the first time for that then see it a second time to appreciate all the underlying depthcant wait for volume 2,cruel
this is a triumph for quentin tarantino  beautifully shot  amazing cinematography  the soundtrack was eclectic but appropriate  the action sequences were a pure joy to watch  especially after so many films find it necessary to matrixize with cgi most action scenes today  this film is a mustsee,cruel
is a superb pop culture masterpiece bravo i loved the color tunes and beautiful attention to detail in a film with little dialogue careful attention must be paid to movement and expression i believe qt through in cheesy one liners such as to get even steven or silly rabbit trixx are for kids to divert meaning away from words and onto physical emotion expressed through ones eyes expressions and body language i cant wait for part deuxa la prochaine,cruel
i really enjoyed while i was watching it but the more i think about it the more i feel certain that is not a truly great movie  heres whyi think i have to consider two aspects of this movie when critiquing it the style and the substance  style includes things like the music the visual quality of the movie the references to other movies and genres and even the tone of thedialogue  substance though includes the quality and the originality of the narrative any moral or philosophical dimension and whether the movie offers anything actually to think about when its overput simply tarrantino is a stylistic genius  if all i wanted were style this movie would be beyond a 10  no one matches a soundtrack to the feel of a movie like tarrantino  no one can make an audience think bad asssss like tarrantinothere were some lines of dialogue that made the audience laugh and cheerbecause they were so bad ass  the fight sequences are great the animationsequence was extremely cool the black and white scenes worked  the feel ofthis movie is simply amazing and thats what keeps the audience engagedwhile the movie is playing  the movie has soul without a doubtbut it seems that tarrantino put all his energy into the style of the movie and spent little time on anything substantive  he uses the standard revenge plot thats served as the narrative backbone for thousands of movies and books over the years and he adds very little to it  its almost as if he wanted to save time and energy on the actual writing so he could devote more attention to makingthe film look and feel really really cool  to tell the truth i care very little about any of the characters in this movie and i dont really wonder all that much whats going to happen to them  in fact using the standard revenge plot line eventakes the interest out of tarrantinos socalled nonlinear storytellingsequence  i mean since its a revenge plot there is a correct sequence even if tarrantino chooses to show the events out of order the result is that his non chronological sequence seems like more of a gimic than anything else  when it comes down to it has soul but it doesnt have a soulsomething that powers the movie from deep within something that lives on when the movie isover  what i mean is that theres really nothing under the surface of this film  its empty spectacle  maybe this is what genius has come to in our times  were so cynical about things we cant see that surface spectacle is all we ask for as if thats all that could possibly matter  but i think that movies like crouching tiger pulp fiction hardboiled show us that a movie can be quite violent and visually stunning but with some actual thoughtprovoking substance  i think tarrantino managed todevelop both aspects in his previous three films but he fails in this oneone caveat with something of a spoiler if vol 2 gives us some truly incredible breaks from the typical revenge plot stuff that we never could have expected maybe the missing baby will prove to be significant in this regard this might redeem the disappointment i feel after vol 1  if vol 1 is just a set up for the surprises of vol 2 all may be forgiven,cruel
i enjoyed but i found myself rolling my eyes a lot quentin tarantino seems to think that if a scene is stirring once then itll be equally effective if he repeats it half a dozen timesthere was absolutely no need for to be divided into two films what tarantino needed was an editor smart enough and tough enough to say theres a lot of unnecessary repetitive crud here and it needs to go one decapitated body spraying out a fountain of blood is fine but not six one huge samurai sword fight is plenty theres enough film here in the can to make one great movie or two mediocre ones i say we make one great onebut tarantino didnt have such a capable gutsy editor too bad,cruel
this movie was an astonishing visual treasure  tarrantinos deep enthusiasm with the martial arts genre shines through in the story but it is masterful use of story that haunts you after you leave the theater  tarrantino is unflinching when it comes to showing true grit  there is a rape scene that instills the viewer with a complex array of emotions fear disgust rage and ultimately triumph most directors shy away from visuals that make the audiene feel vulnerable but puts you right in the same state you felt when you first watched marsellis in that whitesupremacist dungeon in pulp fiction  beyond the tarrantino edge visuals in are superlative an absolute visual treat  battles are fought in delicate snowdappled gardens and against simple shadowonbackdrop 3dscreens his focus on even the faces of the warriors when they are dying and killing are gorgeous  and there is a scene done completely in incredible animation tarrantino has spent his life ingesting film and he has in turn expressed something that is both a wonderful homage to his influences and a totally original sensation,cruel
i went and saw this friday night when it came out and i am so impressed by this movie the only quentin tarentino film i had seen before this was pulp fiction qts movie speak for themselves they have a great script characters and a unique aspect that makes the film what it is just blew me away my favorite thing about the movie was the music and how it just played along with the storyline and the anime sequence was so disturbing that if it would have been real it would have given you the same effect the scene was just how do i describe it wow my kudos to qt uma thurman was just perfect for the role as the brideblack mamba the fight scenes were great it had a little too much blood for me but i wouldnt take it out because it makes the movie,cruel
tonight i decided since being bored outta my mind i would catch the newest entry by quentin tarantino so at approx 1020pm i decided to leave the house and haul a to the loews cineplex to catch the 1045pm showingafter sitting thru some of the most boring trailers i have ever seen it was feature presentation timei loved quentins use of the old fp backdrops but what followed was not worth my time or trouble the first 15 mins of the film was utterly boring quentin what are you doing you are better than this then the film begins to pick up pace now the film actually does have its moments such as the brides arrival in okinawa and some of the films best moments are played out between the bride and the sushi bartender once those comical bits are thru we begin to slip back into the boringness of what is to be the 4th entry for quentini hope you notice i am not trying to get into detail about the film so i dont spoil it for those whom have not seen itnow the fight scenes are pretty decent the gore is outrageous and at times extremely over the top come on how much blood can you lose and still be alive many kudos to knb fx you can see how much tom savini has influenced this company anywayother than the fight scenes which are very good the films pace and mood are destroyed by the use of the obscure music quentin digs out of the ole vaults the trailer entices us with a very catchy rhythm and it is featured in the film for about two minuteswhat a shame that music is why i wanted to attend in the first place instead i am treated to music that neither fits the scenes or provides any help to the films story maybe i am missing something cuz quentin is usually very good at music placement but this time wow is it offmy other peeve is the fact the music is soft then blaring loud which in turn makes the film less enjoyablevol 1 should have just been kill the volume  or kill the dj my other peeve is the fact miramax made quentin cut this film into 2 films i believe had this played in its entirety i think i would have enjoyed it moresorry but this is quentins worst entry so far and i would not recommend this film to anyone especially a qt fanso in february 2004 will my opinion change no because kb should have been left uncut sorry qt i love your work but this i cannot enjoy sorryone of your biggest fans out of ,cruel
vol 1 definately lives up to the expectations  is the story of the bride uma thurman  everyone the bride loved was murdered on her wedding day by the groom bill david carradine and his henchman the bride who was also pregnant is also shot in the head by bill but she survives the baby does not though  so she now seeks revenge on bill and his four henchman played by lucy liu vivica a fox daryl hannah and michael madsenthis film has a great plot but the action definately is the highlight of vol 1  the action is extremely stylish and is supported by great music  this makes this action movie many steps ahead of any other action movie  another thing that stands out in this film is the violence  this film is by far the bloodiest film out there  in all the action scenes blood sprays everywhere and body parts are being cut offthe acting in this film is great  uma thurman is awesome as the bride her only emotion is sadness and revenge and she makes it very clear thats all she feels when you see how she interacts with the other charactersthe supporting cast is also just as good as uma thurman  lucy liu is great as oren shii  her character is very well developed and she alot of humor and sadness to her character  daryl hannah is extremely humorous and has one of the coolest scenes in the film and is the most stylish character her character will have a bigger part in volume 2 however  vivica a fox is good as vernita green and her one scene in this film is awesome and funny  we get a good feel of vernita but she gets killed off way to quickly  david carradine is good as bill we never see his face but we get a perfect sense of how sadistic he is from hearing him  michael madsens character only says one sentence but he seems to play the nice villain his character will definately have more screen time in volume 2  julie dreyfuss was amazing as oren shiis translator  she is extremely funny and adds so much to this film  sonny chiba is good as the swordsmaker  lastly chiaka kuriyama is funny as the sadistic and young go go yaburi  she is pretty sick and viciousthe film does end perfectly and it has a suprising twist that will make you wonder how this is going to affect volume 2 of  it is definately the perfect twist for this nearly perfect film,cruel
finally tarantino has proved to me that it is worth it still to see movies in theatersafter seeing much of the garbage released this year i started to wonder why i am even wasting time shelling out the 8 dollars it costs to see a movie in the theateri dont want to spoil anything but if you have not seen this movie and consider yourself even a bit of a tarantino fan you should go see it you will not be disappointed,cruel
in no way did qt miss his mark this film hit so many levels i can barely get over it perfection perfect 10 this film is certainly not for the squeamish so anyone with problems with gore stay away or watch with hands over the eyes playing homage to grindhouse anime leone and kurowsawa this movie is what hollywood should be about,cruel
none of the reviews i read mention that the film opens with the old shaw brothers logo and that is the key to what this movie is all about its a tributeupdate of the great martial arts movies like 36th chamber of shaolin and street fighter the stars of both of those films feature prominently in as gangster general johnny mo and swordmaker hattori hanzo respectivelythose who grew up on saturday afternoon martial arts movies should appreciate not just the appearance of these two stars but also the ways in which tarantino has learned what made those classics great he films fight scenes so that we can see all the action as opposed to the closeups and quick cuts we get from hollywood action films watching the fights is satisfying not frustratingtheres not much of a plot and that may be another cue from classic martial arts movies not that it mattersthis movie is a series of vignettes tied together by one event the murder of former  assassin black mamba aka the bride by her former colleagues of the deadly viper assassination squad divasuma thurman does a surprisingly convincing job as the unbeatable fighter as do all her opponents the stunts are handled excellently and there werent too many shots where it was easy to tell that it wasnt umasonny chiba is excellent in the films mellow interlude as he creates the ultimate weapon for black mamba to exact her revenge and while i would have liked to have seen a lot more of liu chia hui the few minutes of him fighting uma were worth the price of admissionthose who were not raised on shaw brothers and samurai films will either love this movie for the sylized violence or hate this movie for the stylized violence i loved it and cant wait for volume 2,cruel
 possible spoilerswhile i can give this film high marks for being unique the cartoon flashback was very creative i was really turned off by the montypythonesque blood spurting except in the case of this movie it is bloodspurting samurai instead of the black knightwhile the acting is wonderful in this movie it wasnt enough to keep my interest  i shudder to think how bored i would have been if this movie had not been split  it is worth seeing if you are able to fastforward through most of it,cruel
holy crap ive never seen so much blood not even in blade when it was pumped through a sprinkler system it should have been entitled uma and the arteries it actually distracts a viewer from the rest of the movie which might be a plus because there isnt much substance alas since i have seem part one i will also watch the sequel but under protest more meat and less hemoglobin please,cruel
oh the hollywood drivel i have to endure just to be entertained i wade through dozens of overblown overhyped junk to find a jewel like this one this movie is every bit as good and innovative and entertaining and unique as pulp fiction  go see this movie,cruel
quentin tarantino returns his talents to theaters with the much anticipated vol 1 in a charlies angels meets crouching tiger hidden dragon way tarantino has crafted a film with excessive violence and gore yet the film is a marvel for its homage to samurai movies as well as the commonly referred to spaghetti westerns westerns made in italy such as the good the bad and the ugly however dont expect the entire movie in this showingit actually runs over three hours and tarantino cut the film in half vol 2 opens in february tells the story of black mamba uma thurman whos referred to as the bride a member of a band of international assassins whose boss bill and team turn on her on her wedding day and being pregnant with her bosss child she is brutally attacked and shot in the head luckily she manages to survive and wakes up after being in a coma for four years with the memories of the assault she manages to escape the hospital seek out her killers the first of them is copperhead vivica a fox who would appear to be a happy homemaker if it werent for her deadly intentions after black mamba takes care of copperhead she still has unfinished business with three other assassins of billsthe only other one we see her take on is cottonmouth lucy liu she has to go after the assassins budd michael madsen the california mountain snake daryl hannah and bill david carradine but well see those in volume two whether youre a fan of tarantinos style or not one cant deny his talent his direction is astonishing as well as his screenplay the violence level that he incorporates isnt for the faint of heart however its far more humorous than revolting its intention is to be satirical to violence in society and to ultimately pay homage to samurai films that inspired it after all dont most films that try to pay tribute to their inspirers by exaggerating the original intention this is tarantinos stylehe wants us to be shaken and disgusted by the violence he wants us to the leave the theater feeling tired and affected by it allamong other creative aspects there is an anime sequence that shows the history of cottonmouth assassins murdered her parents as she watched it all happen its the primary reason she becomes such a bloodthirsty person in her adulthood you can expect witty dialogue that made pulp fiction so famous this films isnt as ongoing as pulp fictions however this is only volume one and black mamba hasnt gotten to her conspirator bill yet undoubtedly shell have some choice words for him also consider the fact theres really only one story here pulp fiction had several stories intertwining that required a great deal of dialogue to make the connectionsother creative aspects of note that are smaller in scope but equally important to the greatness of the film are the general format of the film and the music the film plays out like that of book tarantino splits the film into chapters as it focuses on character and plot development the music fits the film like a glove in traditional tarantino style he uses a great deal of 70s music that reflects the films western and samurai impact with a strong dose of disco which gives the film a hip feeloverall vol 1 is an excellent film as tarantino proves once again that his talent is unbeaten in this brand of cinema ,cruel
is an excellent work of violent art that goes beyond the word imaginative  this is definately one of tarantinos best  i thought the film was clever wellacted and choreographed and of course welldirected  uma thurman delivers one of her best performances yet the cinematography and fighting scenes are simply brilliant  every aspect of this film has been done with such great quality that it really allows me to say is one of the best movies of the year,cruel
volume 1 is hands down one the most elaborate original action films ever created  stunning cinematogrophy by robert richardson goes into every kind of genre there is western kung fu drama comedy and of course the cult  along with the blending of different film stocks and animation it is visually a masterpiece  sergio leone sam peckanpah and kenji misumi would all be very proud of quentin for this one  fantastic homage to the great cliffhangers of the old days  cant say enough about how impressed i was,cruel
alright ill start this review off by saying that i am rather biased on the issue of this film im one of those tarnentinofollowers that you hear so much about that would follow him to the grave as long as it meant they could see another one of his films the difference for me of course is that ive gasp never seen a tarnetino film yes i know this is terrible and it will be remedied soon however vol 1 just made me know why i am a tarnetino fanthe second reason i am biased is because i read the script before seeing the film a couple weeks before in fact why does this make me biased because i can view the film as the whole that i wish it was rather than the half of a film that it turned out to be okay lets get down to the nittygritty and hopefully ill explain a little bit more of that in the reviewthe actingive not much to say about the acting in this film it was perfect for what it was supposed to be it was perfect with what i was expecting from the script there were some awesome moments umas first line in the film still haunts me to this day because of the way it was written yes but also because of her delivery i have no complaints with the acting in so it deserves a 10acting score 1010the writingi love writerdirectors i hate it when a bad director takes a good script and makes a bad film out of it i hate it when good directors midunderstand a script and make a bad film out of it neither of those can happen when youve got a writerdirector tarentino knew what he wanted to write and he wrote it perfectly the brilliance of the script is not understood i dont believe until youve seen vol 2 i love the script version of vol 2 a bit better than vol 1 but once you see it the amazingness of vol 1 is shown yes it is a revenge film but it is the revenge film of all time every line every scene is perfectwriting score 1010the directingand this is where the film truly shines every shot is amazing every shot is what it should be every shot delivers exactly the right sensation to the viewer okay i had some different shots in mind from when i read the script but its okay because what tarentino has delivered is better than what i could have come up with everyone imagining going into the film industry must see the chapter entitled the house of blue leaves simply for the four amazing styles in which the fights are shotdirecting score 1010overalli admitted at the beginning that i was biased for this film before i saw it but i dont think that that means i think a crappy film is a good film any film that puts this much effort into being good deserves to be seen and this film not only tries to be good it accomplishes that goal stunninglythe only problem i have with this film is not a problem with the director actors or anyonebut mirimax i have a problem with cutting the film in half yes it is a four hour movie and yes people dont like four hour movies i dont know what the solution was but i hate that they had to cut the film in halfjust know that you will not be disappointed when vol 2 rolls around it is better than vol 1 through and throughso should you see vol 1 i would say yes for sure but i do want to say there is a lot of violence in the film not as much as i was lead to believe was in it from the script but still a ton some of it is unrealistic and meant to be so but there is a lot that was so realistic that the more squeamish among you may want to skip this the rest of you yes go see the filmoverall score 1010,cruel
vol 1 to say nothing of vol 2 is the best film that tarantino has made so far since qt is so versed in different film genres it is fitting that he had to pay homage to martial arts films this is the best martial arts film i have ever seen although i must admit i have limited experience with the genre everything about is unbelievable the powerful soundtrack by the rza that completely fits and compliments each scene its perfect and i think im going to have to get it the masterful performance by uma thurman i think an oscar is not out of the question here daryl hannah surprised me with her acting because acting is not a skill that she is known for vivica a fox on the other hand was the same person that she has played in every movie and i was glad that she died early lucy liu was also good although i dont think she is a particularly good actress sonny chiba turns in a great guest appearance and chiaki kuriyamawow i think that this girl should get her own movie evil schoolgirls are not something you see every day it came as no surprise to me that she also starred in battle royale although i have not seen battle royale yetcan we get a us dvd release please i know of its reputation this film pays the proper respect to the kung fu movies of the seventies down to the vintage opening of the film vol 1 is divided into five chapters and chapter three is the only one i had a problem with as it is entirely in anime and i despise anime it was well done i just dont like anime michael madsens character budd is not really in vol 1 at all and the same with daryl hannahs character well have to wait to see them in vol 2 the violence that everybody is going on and on about is not as bad as i thought i thought that some of the blood gushing was actually a little cartoonish but this is how films were done in hong kong and so tarantino is remaining faithful to that the showdown with oren ishis henchmen was shot in black and white i think because if it were in glorious blood soaked color it might have a turned fragile american audiences off andor b gotten stamped with an nc17 rating bottom line this movie kicks so much ass and i think it beats the matrix at its own game go see the best movie of 2003 you wont be able to wait for vol 2 i sure as hell cant,cruel
i just returned from a screening of vol1 and i must say that i was completely impressed and pleasently suprised  quentin tarantino has revived the entire action genre  although there wasnt anything completely new in this film it managaed to do everything in a new and creative way however i must say that to most it will seem completely original and it is but people just wont get the many homages and sincere throwbacks to the grindhouse and splatter classics of the 70s pretty much the best decade of film the suprisingly talented uma thurmangattaca gives a heartfelt and kick ass performance as tarantinos title charachter bleep thats what happens everytime they speak her name you see four yrs before the film starts her own assasination squad turned on her and she was brutally beaten with her husband and unborn child and murdered on her wedding day or so they thought she wakes up out of a coma after four years and the revenge begins to gush and does it gush since this by far the bloodiest r rated film in probably forever but its done in a respectable cartoon like manner so that it doesnt come off offensively but more light hearted now i definatly dont wanna soften this movie down cause it is indeed an extremely graphic genre picture but it also has extremely sentimental and passionate performances from its cast powered with great dialogue and a brisk and bloody revenge tale  go see right now the wait is on the cliffhanger at the end of this one rivals any other cliffhanger ever created the wait is on,cruel
i didnt think uma could carry a film like that but she did and she did it wonderfully  it was more bloody than i thought it would be but it was not too much to a point where you would think it is gratuitous  i also recommend everyone to go and see once upon a time in mexico if you like this movie,cruel
lets face it quentin tarantino is a guy that you either love or hate if you love him this movie is going to blow your mind  be prepared for a mindblowing experience at the theater  tarantino defies the norm by not being tarantinoesque  he removes the catchy language presented in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction  he is a bona fide action director with  the special effects are nothing short of amazing  uma thurman delivers a heartless performance not seen on screen since clint eastwood in dirty harry  this is certainly a revenge movie full of humor and injokes much like jay and silent bob strike back was for kevin smith fans tarantino delivers a movie packaged for fans of his universe  many injokes and catch phrases are included  tell your friends to see this movie  if youre not a tarantino fan all i can say is that this movie is one thousand times better than the matrix sequels ever will be  volume two cant come soon enough 88 my scale only goes to 8  no movie can be a perfect 10,cruel
throughout this long relentless contest of wills with his audience quentin still displays flashes of skillbut it feels like hes been out of the game so long he isnt even going to try to compete with the edgy movies of the last few years and retreats headlong into the 70s ethos he knows so well insteadas a hongkong splatter flick its too long and emotional with a few good scenes stranded in otherwise lackluster writing and directorial choices coming up well short of the genres best  as a witty tarantino neonoir its too gory to be chilling or effective too straightforward to be really clever or engaging too monotonous to impress an audience with matrixes and ringquests fresh in their mindssimply put reservoir dogs and pulp fiction and even jackie brown resembled classic noirish gangster movies but were actually much better than the source movies that inspired themsadly quentin may now be far gone enough to want to pay such loving tribute to the 70sploitation era that he will completely hide his talent to create a true bmovie one that hits every note so imperfectly its just as forgettable meaningless and poorly assembled as the movies to which hes paying homageill reserve final judgment until vol 2 comes out but until then id only recommend this one to indiscriminate fans of action movies and bad really bad 70s fare,cruel
i loved everything about this film i agree its all style and no substance but it does what it does sooo well i loved all the flashy directorial decisions like the anime scene and the black and white and the sound effects pure entertainment,cruel
this movie is really cool and well done the action is awesome to watch and the acting is great too the gore and blood was a little to much but it was so stupid you just had to laugh at it this is probably one of tarantinos more entertaining films,cruel
heres my major problem with qts long awaited  while the film is always interesting from a movie buffs perspective a qt film always is even when you end up hating it in the end it doesnt get really interesting until the last thirty minutes which are wildly entertaining when uma stunningly beautiful and vicious as the revenge fueled blood lusting black mambathe bride and the action move to tokyo  so in my mind even if all of volume ii to be released in february of 2004 is as entertaining as the last thirty minutes of volume i why in the world didnt the hire an intelligent editor who couldve easily chopped out some drawn out exposition does a blevel revenge fantasy really need an hour and twenty minutes of exposition and delivered us an all out goforbroke extravaganza of overthetop violence and action in one two and a half to three hour volume  the only answer i can come up with is that miramax is greedy and qt is full of himself  he thinks every cool idea and he has some really cool ones here from the retro opening credits to the battle to the death in a japanese garden snowglobe at the end that pops in his head needs to be filmed and every spec of film he captures needs to be in the movieall these things aside is pretty fun if you like gruesome cartoonish violence a simple plot line revenge is a dish best served cold compelling visuals i didnt care for the anime sequence but found my jaw drop at the stunningly beautiful cinematography and set design in the tokyo sequences nonlinear storytelling and an ultra hip soundtrack this really just is a fetish film for fans of kungfu flicks death wish fantasies and spaghetti westerns and there aint nothing wrong with that as long as you realize thats what this is  the casual moviegoer will probably be dumbfounded as the film is virtually void of the trademark qt dialogue which is what i think made the overrated pulp fiction so oddly endearing to mainstream audiences  i ultimately plan to see volume ii when it comes out because i finally would like to see uma thurman until then our bloodlust will have to be satisfied by this mixedbag of cinematic tricks,cruel
ohhh quentins a genius he made a 4 hour 75 million dollar grindhouse movie that had to be cut into two films to preserve his visionno what he made is his most stylish film to date with the weakest dialouge i have ever heard him write this script is such absolute crap its hard to believe they say those lines with straight faces but no you scream its an homage to 70s shaw brothers films he could have written it so much better have you seen the baby cart movieslone wolf and cubthe dialouge in these huge samurai gore fests is far superior to what quentin tried to do with this comes off a little confused to me is it an homage is it a spoof does it take it self seriously its all of the above i usually rate a movie by the emotions it gets out of me did i smile did i laugh did i say wow did i cry the only time i said anything to myself in was wow look at all that bloodspraying bloodspraying i might add that had to be in be in black and white so the mpaa wouldnt slap an nc17 on the film clips from this fight scene are in color in the trailers werent they or am i just crazy dont get me wrong im a huge fan of quentins work and i enjoyed this film kinda but sooo many people are calling it genius and his best film to date all of these people should dust off their copies of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs both of these films are beautifully crafted and wonderfully written this one is not,cruel
i dont know what this guy is talking about saying that is a rip off  everyone i went to see it with loved and most people seemed to like it that i have talked to  i like that tarantino tryed something new his dialogue is missing but what we get is a better matrix  all of the fight sequences are better in this  there is also funny parts such as when uma thurmans character breaks out of the hospital and steals the pussy wagon all in all id say that this is a 9 out of 10,cruel
i think its his best film yet its qts ode to all that inspires him cheesy b flicks kung fu films and anime if you are not a fan of any of the above you will probably hate this film however if you enjoy any of the mentioned influences you will definitely have fun,cruel
ive seen twice so far and theres no doubt that we are in front of the best film of the year and one of the most exciting piece of cinema to come in a long timejust as it happened with pulp fiction the movie will go down on history and its destined to become a cult classic in a blink of an eyebeing said that that it is a cult film it will no doubt polarize audiences in a very violent way just as it happened with such bold works of art as magnolia dancer in the dark or even pulp fiction art should be subversive iswhats the most amazing thing about to me it is tarantinos extraordinary ability to steal from every possible genre and make them his very ownlets face it this could be material for a b movie or worst but through tarantinos vision robert richardsons masterful cinematography the sharp dialogue umas one of a kind performance and the epic soundtrack that makes you feel like youre watching a sergio leone  ennio morricone film on acid feels like the most original extravagant and hyper cool movie we always wanted to seeits already there in my top ten list of all time along with rosemarys baby the godfather dancer in the dark pulp fiction vertigo and all the movies that for being such strong works of art you either love them or hate them but you can not be gray about it and tarantino is not mediocre,cruel
many people will consider this quentin tarantinos best film yet others will hate it it certainly has more style and focus than any of his previous efforts which were frequently burdened with subplots well no subplots here the plot couldnt be simpler uma thurman as the bride is the subject of an executionstyle massacre carried out by her former associates in an elite assassination team which is headed by the mysterious and faceless at least in this first installment bill unfortunately for them she survives in a coma from which she awakes after four years to discover that not only is her groom dead but so is the baby she was carrying at the time of her wedding the rest of the movie is simply her revenge as she knocks off the team onebyone if you have heard that the movie is violent it is however the violence is extremely cartoonish and stylized for example when she lops off someones head arm or leg blood spurts out as if from a shower head while the blood is stylized the fight scenes are very good in fact uma thurman an actress with a very uneven career who never ever gave us much hint of exceptional talent pretty much carries this entire movie on her back not only is she onscreen acting about 95 of the time but she engages in several extended and strenuous sword and knifefighting scenes many of which she obviously had to do without benefit of a stunt double shes an absolute revelation here and if her career was a bit on hold the last few years you can bet its back on track with this flick its not just her fighting either its her acting she shows in this movie that she can deliver a line as well as any actress around there are several classic scenes in this movie but one of the least violent ones has her delivering some of the best lines this is where she goes to okinawa and drops in on the sushi shop of a man who also happens to be a master samurai swordsmith played delightfully and with incredible comic timing and charm by sonny chiba a japanese martial arts actor with almost no presence in hollywood cinema which raises the question of how he got the name sonny anyway theres a moment when hes still acting the role of the sushi chef and hes engaging in some banter with her and he asks her why she needs to to find hattori hanzo him her reply is that she needs some japanese steel by which she means a samurai sword digression the samurai sword is regarded by most of those in the know as the deadliest and finest sword ever made it is unique in terms of being both thickand thus heavy enough to deliver forceful blowsand yet almost razor sharp made of very highgrade steel they are very difficult to break at the same time a good samurai sword is also a work of art each one of the fine ones with its grip and scabbard is made by hand and decorated uniquely its ironic that one of the most efficient handtohand combat instruments ever made can also be one of the most beautiful objects of art in the world this movie despite its rampant references to other movies and to pop culture of the past is more than anything else a celebration of the samurai sword and bushido the code of the samurai the last major action scene of the movie is the swordfight between uma thurman and lucy liu liu has become probably to her chagrin a character actress who normally plays either bad girls or evil women in this case shes an evil woman and she plays the role to the hilt she also puts up a hell of a fight in the final scene but of course there would be no vol 2 if she prevailed so i hope i didnt spoil the movie for you postscript the usual humorless suspects think theres too much violence in this movie to some extent tarantino has fanned the flames by saying i paraphrase but pretty accurately i want thirteen year old girls to see it i think theyll find it empowering this has appalled some social critics well first of all mr tarantino is not the most serious dude on the planet secondly with its r rating which should arguably be nc17 a thirteen year old shouldnt be able to see it anyway tarantino really knows how to stir up publicity and im fairly sure thats the true intent of his comment the violence in this movie is caroonish and stylized and totally unrealistic except to the most naive and hypersensitive of people even so i dont think theres as much harm in seeing uma thurman extract welldeserved justice at the point of a sword as there is in the braindead plot and action of the charlies angels franchise uma looks like what the angels merely play at a woman so good at what she does that she cant be ignored my daughter is a young woman and i think shell learn more about life from than charlies angels some critics have said that this movie is much more violent than any of tarantinos previous movies and on one level thats true however the violence in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were much more realistic than the violence in these hypersensitive critics need to get a life,cruel
a refreshing and very original movie is what we always expect from quentin tarantino and that is just what he delivered this year was full of generic action movies and sorry sequels maybe that fact made seem better either way this movie kicks ass tarantino mixes his love of japanese and chinese action movies spaghetti westerns and even a little anime to craft his own action masterpiece uma thurman is outstanding and the rest of cast is great especially sonny chiba the action sequences are just as good if not better than those from the matrix and done without the help of loads of computer effects some say the film may have been better if it wasnt split in two but the cliffhanger ending was done excellently and makes you mark your calender for the second half this movie is sure to be an instant classic and a great new addition into tarantinos wild and crazy family 810,cruel
i still will have to watch this thing at least 2 more times but my first impression was mindblowing if you didnt liked tarantino before dont even bother but if you liked him this is a must it has so much stuff from making fun to himself to make homage to the classic japanese samurai films that i am still digesting it as with other contemporary films the dialogs suck and i am not talking about the japanese which seem to work better but is not the dialogs what will get you going but the mix of action gory humor and visual candy i loved the anime part  i really cant wait for vol ii,cruel
i saw the saturday after it opened to a 34filled movie house it was great overall there was so much violence and gore that it the begining it was gross there was so much that later on in the movie it got to the point where it was comical it was also one of the strangest films ive ever seen like pulp fiction it was edited and probably written differently presenting it in a unconventional way which i love in my opinion qt has made another contemporary masterpiece,cruel
this is hands down the best movie to come out in 2003 even thought 2003 is almost over this movie is so good  its still gonna be the best movie of 2004right next to volume 2 watching this movie is like taking a tour through director quentin tarantinos subconcious he is filming what everyone else is thinking,cruel
the only other qt movie ive seen was pulp fiction and thought that was great  fell asleep watching resevoir dogs and never seen jackie brownanyway going into this movie i knew it was going to be good considering all the hype and great reviews its been getting but i tell youthe trailers and publicity certainly does not do any justice to actually watching this movie  its humorous bloody great story line and the directing was just beautifully donethe fight scenes are 10 times better than the matrix1 2 and i bet 3 fight scenes and the acting is just superb  the detailing is awesome and each character has their own twisted personalitiesi cannot wait until february rolls but in the meanwhile ill be going back to the theaters again to see this,cruel
this movie was so much fun to watch  for all of you people out there that have ever had a burning desire for revenge you could not possibly see a better film than this to quench that thirstof course me being a girl and all found the movie to be a bit on the gory side  but overall i was entertained the entire time  i found the actions sequences to be spectacular as well as the mixup of animee black  white and color  as of right now i can not wait until the second half of the movie comes out  i enjoyed it immensely but the only thing that i could have done without was seeing all the gore  oh wellwhat can you do,cruel
this film is violent in the way that rock concerts are loud and grand prix cars are fast and oceans are wetthis film is beautiful in the way that rock concerts are beautiful and grand prix cars are beautiful and oceans are beautiful,cruel
the movie itself had good points the cast of uma thurman was perfect theaction scenes were very well done i am really intrigued though as to why this movie is among the best 150 movies of all times i agree that this movie is original for the average moviegoer at least the one that doesnt know anime movies are being made since 40 years ago though itis not mainstream in our shores yet in terms of style character and story this movie develops like a traditional anime movie there is an abuse of culture though as everything in this movie seemed exagerate  if you have ever watched anime movies you will realize that the best ones do not use half the violencecheap effects this movie used and insteadinvested more time in character development drama and story who is billwhy he tried to kill the black mamba what was the relationship between theblack mamba and the other members of the viper squad prior to the attemptedmurder were they friends there are many things left unsaidunexplained that typical good anime movies would have covered in detailnow to my original question why is this movie rated so high even though there are at least a dozen of anime moviesovas that have it better in terms ofcharacter story and execution than this one is it because people is reallygetting bored of watching the same hollywoodesque plots  me thinksaxel,cruel
is an awesome movie it starts out with an action scene and does not let up  the film is sort of gory but that is typical tarantino  the fight scenes especially the martial arts ones were captivating  it did not feel like you were in the theater for almost 2 hours  my vote is a 9 out of 10 because even though i know there is a volume 2 due out next year the ending was still too abrupt i also always love the soundtracks to mr tarantinos movies,cruel
it is clear that this movie was not designed by committee to appeal to everyone and their little old auntie i think most fans of qt will like this movie to spoilers ahead  you have been warned plenty of people have explained what is good about this film there is no need for me to repeat it instead i would like to respond to some of the negative reviewers who appear to have missed some major points or simply went to the wrong movie for them for those who do not understand the use of animation in the middle of the film  the young girl of eleven kills the man who murdered her family to do so she preys upon his pedophile nature to get close to him and kill him how could this important backstory have been filmed any other way with a real 11 year old girl no thank you the use of animation allows qt to examine this subplot without flinching i thought it was very effective and the animation was very well done the animation also served to highlight how those scenes might be perceived by a child surrealas for qt just cashing in i would say the opposite is true this film shows such loving craftsmanship in every second on the screen that even if i hated the film i would feel like it wasnt due to a lack of qt trying every detail every scene every musical note seems hand selected for effectthe bleeping of the characters name makes poetic sense she is nobody she is vengeance she is the weapon as well as the wielder her individual name will not be hers again until she has done what she must do or perhaps it never will be bleeping her name highlights this fact better than simply not saying her name it is done to make a point she who must not be namedwe are not necessarily supposed to be sympathetic with the bride she was after all a hired killer herself instead we are supposed feel sympathy for what she represents or perhaps we are to fear what she has become perhaps a little of both for people complaining about the lack reality yakuza using swords etc i really think they went to the wrong movie this movie is a visual portrayal of the fury of pure vengeance manifest as the human we know only as the bride in kabuki the bride would probably have been wearing a demon mask it is not supposed to be realistic in the physical plane at all it is realistic on an emotional  metaphysical level it is not about the physical appearances it is about the feelings and the motivation besides do we really need another gun shootemup movie i will agree with the detractors on one point this film does not have the punchy dialog and snappy pacing of pulp fiction i was slightly disapointed in that area however this might not have been a mistake but rather by choice the bride is alone she does not have confidants or friends even the sword maker sonny chiba who helps her has very little to say to her having been killed and reborn as a demon of vengeance she is now apart from the world perhaps the lack of dialog was intended to add to that feelinglastly to those who are preoccupied with the notion that there was too much blood what did you expect a sword fight to produce puppies when people fight to the death with swords i think the one thing you can be sure of is that there will be blood and gore modern movies and television skirt this issue and perhaps have tainted peoples expectations,cruel
do people find it funny that gallons of blood shoot out of every limb that gets severed in this movie   it certainly doesnt appear as if it is made to look real   to top that off black mamba learns to speak japanese in a month   it looks like quentin is pulling a costner making an overrated epic in hopes of getting some award,cruel
it took some getting use to but the distraction of gore hides the substance of director ts quirky tallent  the first scenes tell it all the surealistic passes are a nice touch spelling the need to think beyond the surfaceif you so incline to go there  i personally think the plot would have been tighter if bill remained faceless as the protagonist was nameless  and i would have liked a little more of the sword makers story notwithstanding i would recommend it to those who think like i do who seek subcultural archetypal parallels for me this is a picture of those giants of hell who seek to transcend thier just deserts through child birth and family or through rising to the pinpoint of power  they find the mysterious hand of justice will recycle the worst of them only to maintain the rest in a rising line of cruelty,cruel
seriously i love this movie  out of tarentinos other films ive only seen pulp fiction so i wouldnt go so far as to call myself one of his fans but this movie looked interesting  i walked out of the film loving it  this movie has everything that i wanted and more  homages to kung fu movies anime a rocking soundtrackand action beyond belief  i walked out truly loving ityou can all read about the story in other posts but i think that it was really well done and i had no problems with it  i thought the actors worked wonderfully in it i thought that it was stylistically and aesthetically beautiful and i really had a good time in this flim  some parts can be pretty brutal but some are just so over the top that you cant help but laugh at them  the origin of oren ishii was sadistic and brutal but done so wonderfully in the style that tarentino chose that it couldnt help but be emotionalreading over some of these other comments i notice that the movie is pretty hit and miss with most people  everyone seems disappointed for some reason and i just wonder why  so the story is more linear and less complicated than his other flickswho cares  not every movie needs to jump around in time and tell a horribly complicated story  adding elements from pulp fiction and other films into this would have made it less enjoyable i believe  films dont have to be overly intelligent and complicated to be good filmsget over it,cruel
smartly done quentin tarantino movie lots of swords lots of blood lots of fun  watch itsome people might not get it but its a work of art different kind of action movie very stylish very entertaining and yes its very smart the kind of movie that ill watch over and over again,cruel
i thoroughly enjoyed vol 1 for what it is and plan to see it again before it leaves my local theatre and im looking forward to vol 2 its a shallow movie with nothing underneath the surface but the surface is so lovingly madei just ate it up it was a fun ride a good ole fashion revenge flick uma thurman going out to get everybody and she gets em good and thats itcriticizing the movie according a to more complex criteria than that seems foolishwhich seems to be the case for most of the negative criticisms ive read about the movie james berardinellis review of the movie for instance is a perfect illustration of a movie critic taking himself as a movie critic too seriously and the movie as a film much too seriouslyand judging the movie all wrong httpmoviereviewscolossusnetmasterhtmlfor example the protagonist in a revenge flick is defined more by their ability to kick ss than their ability to carry on witty conversation as entertaining as it might be to listen to two gangsters discuss the deeper meaning of a foot massage that kind of extended dialogue would most likely slow down the kinetic energy of the all cool kungfu thats going on in so the movie doesnt have a lot of memorable dialogue so what isnt pulp fiction nor do i think it is meant to be it is a wonderfully crafted kungfu samurai killemall and killemgood revenge flickwhen i hear criticisms like it was too bloody and too violent it reminds of something i inadvertently heard kathylee gifford say about pulp fiction one day while i was flicking as fast as i could through the channels did it really need to be so violentthats like asking does a musical really need to have so much singing yeah it does its called the sound of music what did you expectquentin tarantinos latest movie is called kinda tells you what youre in for dont you thinkif you dont like gory and violent revenge flicks you wont like the movie thats it dont go but for what it is it is extremely well made stunning and amazing at times andi hate this phrasebut a pure cinematic delight its like homer simpson discovering triplechocolate ice cream kungfu revenge flicks dont get any better than this,cruel
well hes halfway there anyway only the release of volume 2 will show whetherwhat am i talking about of course volume 2 will be amazing anybody who doesnt think so should have their head examined is quite simply the greatest action movie of this or maybe any other generation it elevates trash to art and then elevates art to trash turning over everything we thought we knew about film action kung fu exploitation and quentin tarantino actually it confirms what we already knew about quentin tarantino but who would have thought that such a movie was possiblefor the one person who doesnt already know the story bill and his cronies take out uma thurmans wedding party she survives and shes out for revenge but really thats besides the point revenge is the vehicle for tarantino to throw more stylistic flourishes and homages on the screen than any other movie since tarantinos last movie it may take several years before serious film scholars can finally lock down just how many references occur in this film although film is so deeply built into tarantinos subconscious that we may never know how much this movie owes to everything from the spaghetti westerns to the films of sonny chiba and bruce leethe action sequences are the best ever filmed period never have technical expertise and pure artistry intersected so beautifully as in these sequences after a summer in which audiences were bombarded to no end with mindless car chases and banal shootouts offers massive stunningly choreographed fight sequences that never miss a beat tarantino manages to keep the pure exhilaration of his film at fever pitch until the false ending intended to raise expectations for volume 2 but succeeding only at reminding me of the epic that could have been but if half of the greatest action movie ever made isnt enough to get you to slap down seven bucks then you must really hate moviesmy subject heading was in reference to an article i actually read on this website in which tarantino said that he would not be satisfied with his career until he created a scene that matched the raw power of the final showdown in the good the bad and the ugly i dont know if he quite matched it in volume 1 although in several moments which i will allow you to find he came awfully close if he doesnt match it in volume 2 no scratch that if he doesnt blow the final scene of the good the bad and the ugly out of the water in volume 2 i may just be disappointed but tarantino is not one to disappoint,cruel
this film is so much fun  there are so many different sometimes subtle sometimes obscure but always unique places this film brings us  just like you heard this film is an homage to the best revenge themed films ever made  outside of the sublime screenplay  just looking at the settings is a trip down memory lane  of course movie critics never had the patience for tarantino  apparently the entire country has contracted add or something and the idea of a 3 12 hour movie is frightening to them  well if you like short movies i am sure that gigli ii will be out soon  my biggest complaint of this film is directed solely at the soulless minions of evil running the mpaa and miramax  wtf  when can an r rated movie just be for adults and contain whatever the director wanted  why does some censorship squad get final say over someone elses artistic vision  and why are films that have no sexual content whatsoever being picked apart  why because some stupid impressionable idiot somewhere might emulate what they see on the screen  because some sheriff in hayseed alabama might get offendedthe rating system needs to go  if you like a director producer actor or screenplay go see that movie  if you get offended leave  there are plenty of pg and pg13 films that completely inappropriate for young children and some r rated films that children should see  but because some censorship nazi believes his value system is more important than yours too bad  of course why would the studios complain  they can sell the original mangled copy and then pimp the directors cut  which is what the theatrical release should have been anyway  thats what you pay the director for,cruel
is a movie for people who love movies  people have commented on the gore being exaggerated and excessive but it is exaggerated for the purpose of satirizing the cheesy style of the 70s martial arts films we hold so near and dear  tarantino has proven again that with a small budget and great performances you can make a great film,cruel
possible spoiler but probably notwow what a sexy movie i greatly enjoyed volume 1 the first night that i saw it and i enjoyed it even more upon second viewing quentin tarantino has a real knack for making films of amazing precision and jazz and this one is no exceptionafter reading some negative reviews on this film i can feel nothing but disgust for those that insult this movie i have seen many movies in my day and i can honestly say that this one ranks among the top possibly the best as far as the style choreography and musical score go damn this movie had great music the scene in tokyo with lucy lui and the japanese yakuza was nothing short of amazing all of o rens luis crew were very hip and sexy especially go go her top body guard in the school girl uniform lucy luis character o ren was beautiful and brutal its just too bad that she died in the film im actually considering renting charlies angels after seeing her performance in this film and im not the least bit interested in the charlies angels franchise but if her performance is anywhere near what it was in it would be worth watching the acting was very believable and enjoyable which brings me to wonder what the critics of it are basing their standards on apparently they had forgotten to take their prozac that day lastly the choreography of the fight scenes put the matrix reloaded to shame in other words it was fantasticthe endless gushing squirting and gurgling of blood may offend some viewers as it was likely one of the bloodiest films of all time but the gore wasnt to be taken seriously it was a semi parody of old kung fu movies other critics were angry over the slow pace of the film and the fact that it is cut in half they feel that the producers are trying to rip off the public by making them pay for two tickets to see the whole story well as far as that argument goes if you want to see a movie that is the length of two typical movies paying twice only makes sense besides who the hell cares that you have to pay an extra 850 i would have paid double the price just to see each half we arent somalians most of us anyway were americans the vast majority and we have disposable income i dont care who the hell you are or where the hell you work so stop bitching like 6 year old girls who didnt get their favorite barbie doll for christmas and keep your idiotic opinions inside of your seratonin deficient brains so if you work for 30 cents a month as so many other us citizens do then dont go see part 2 and save your annual salary for a bigmack and fries its that damn simple i feel better nowok where was i o yeah this movie was bloody but it really had to be in order to be all that it could bei could go on all day about how great this film was but i have better things to do so go see it love it when its over drool over what you have just seen go home turn on the computer type imdbcom into your web browser click volume 1 vote on it give it a 10 write a comment about how wonderful it was then go see it again1010,cruel
i just returned from the movie theatre having seen by far the most violent film ive ever sat through as far as sheer gore goes it was hardcore pornography everything was shown and done with comic book intensity that is to say at times unrealistic overthetop one would think killing would become boring and repetitive after a while but lord no tarantinos oozes with so much style and originality you will find yourself chuckling at a clever camera angle the odd and exciting music or even massive overhauls of entire sequences done in such completely bizarre and wonderful ways death becomes everythingsomething to fear and at times something to shamefully look forward toi dont want to give anything away as far as the plot goes but it kind of jumps around the same way his other movies do also the acting is very good and there are some hilarious scenes especially the dialogueseriously if you like action movies odd movies martial arts movies anime or 70s campsee this film it will floor you it will make you sick it will excite you and it will turn your head to mushbut pleasant mush thats the state i am in right nowsome people took dates to see itsome people had their elderly parents with them i cannot believe any of these people enjoyed the movie but i did i cannot wait to see part 2,cruel
according to master swordmaker hattori hanzo in vol 1revenge is never a straight line its a forest and like a forest its easy to lose your way to get lost to forget where you came inthis pretty much embodies directorwriter quentin tarantinos whacked edgy adrenadalized and exquisitely crafted vol 1 it is one of the best movies of the year and by far the years coolest movie like the quote from hanzo played by the great action star martial artist sonny chiba is singular in purpose a vengeance tale with a stylized narrative which includes some awesome use of anime tarantino is in masterful form with his trademark expletive alliterated dialog and over the top whacked sense of humor this is genius given the bushido virtues of justice courage benevolence honor and loyalty bushido inazo nitobe sense of humor is not one of the distinguished virtues therefore having one is good for us in vol 1 tarantino did his homework on bushido the way of the samurai inherent in the samurai culture and japanese culture is the dichotomy between exquisite beauty and extreme dispassionate brutality tarantino nails this in vol 1 in a movie scene oren ishii lucy liu wearing an impeccable white kimono recites a haiku in the middle of a snow covered garden before a fight to the death with the bride uma thurman this is simply mesmerizingin vol 1 the bride amazing uma thurman embarks on her path of vengeance the joke is that we really dont know her name directors choice she has one over on clint eastwood in the sergio leone movies the bride was a member of an elite group of assassins all working for the mysterious bill an unseen david caradine however when she decides to leave her crew lucy liu daryl hannah and vivica a fox put the hit on the pregnant bride and her husband at the wedding in an el paso church the bride thurman miraculously survives and is in a coma for 4 years upon awakening from the coma the bride vows to call it square a critical element in her path of vengeance is finding hattori hanzo chiba to make her the classic katana to dispatch those who betrayed hertarantinos bill is an homage to classic samurai movies and westerns and at its heart is uma thurman uma thurman is awesome her character is strong smart and singular in focus the ultimate in single tasking she also has a wicked wry sense of humor in her delivery she is so good at masking any of her characters vulnerability thus making her empathetic the scene where she awakes from her coma is both hysterical and chilling she looks great and is in great shape her fighting scenes are bushido she fights with expedience precision and dispassion there is an obscene beauty in dispatching ones opponent with a single strike its great to see sonny chiba as hanzo the spiritual anchor perhaps in vol 2 he will display his technical prowess lucy liu as the half breed japanese oren ishii yakuza leader is stunning liu delicately balances bipolar ishiis beauty and ruthlessness liu has a classic scene in which one of her subordinates questions her leadership because she is an american and half chinese again tarantino did his homework the fight between the bride and oren ishii will be a movie classic much like thurmans astonishing battle with ishiis henchmen the joke seems to be that the bride is really learning to use the katana so she sometimes holds the sword like a baseball bat however in battle she uses the more classic formprops to tarantino thurman liu chiba and fox on killer movie this is the years best really vol 1 is the zenith of pop culture moviemaking cant wait until vol 2 in february,cruel
where do i begin the music the action the directing the acting the writing or just the plain badassness of it i think that ill go in ordertarentino once again proves that part of the story can be told through music that its not just there as filler a handy trait that he taught robert rodruguez every piece of music that qt uses is not just fill space it is there to set mood make it more intense that sort of thing and ill be damned if he didnt pick some great music to go along with his filmholy shit that is all i can say about the mind blowing action that was well choreographed rehearsed and orchestrated he takes cinematic martial arts to a whole new level by kicking it old school in 2003 in a world of cgis and the wachowski bros dont get me wrong i love the matrx films and am eagerly anticipating the new one it is inspiring to see a film use wires to make them fly and training to make them fight the fight between black mamba and the 100 minions was one of the best i have ever seen in my life the way she moves through them with ease and the use of the camera is damn good too who didnt love the silhuetted portionqts attention to detail has made him one of the most respectable directors in my opinion in film today my favourite scene is the simple scene wiggle youre big toe that sort of intricate scene would be overlooked and probably not done had it been another director and to be able to make me a guy who doesnt enjoy anime at all get really into the anime sequence takes some talenteverybody turned great performances in this film i cant wait for volume 2 to come out so i can see more of carradine and madsen as their characters were underplayed but thurmans intensity is only matched by lucy liu and cant remember her name but gogos ferocitygreat script qt took a cliche plot and made it original adding a twist anywhere it fit his love for filmmaking and classic martial arts films really shine herebadass movie i give it 1010,cruel
 possible spoilersi put the spoilers heading on the top of this review just in case there are people who are really hard core about that sort of thing but i also must say that it is impossible to really spoil this movie for anyone by telling them plot elements because you know whats going to ultimately happen by just reading the plot description eventually the bride is going to and everyone associated with reuning her wedding day this is not a movie that you watch for the plot and not a movie that you can enjoy being told about this is a movie that needs to be watched it demands it roger ebert described it best when he refered to it as story telling without a story this is exactly right because we have all seen this story before hero gets wronged and wrongs the evil doers but because tarantino is so good at what he does he uses every element he can to make this the most interesting thing imaginable i have already heard people complain about the amount of blood in this movie these people obviously didnt get the point this is a movie about movies that has no grounding in reality it is a throw back to very low budget kungfu films and also to film noir and spagatti westerns the movie is almost a thesis on the simularities between the genres by combining the elements together you get to thinking that there were already many elements there in the first place in all three genres somebody has been wronged usually someone important to them has died or they have had an attempt on their life and they are out for quick justice by killing everyone of them in fact many spaggeti westerns took plots from samari movies and vice versaquentin makes it very clear that the audience are his puppets and he is the puppet master controlling every aspect of the film he of course has always done this to an extent as in pulp fiction in res dogs where he jumps the story around simply for effect he of coursse does that here too but in this movie he even goes as far as to bleep the brides real name out simply because he doesnt want you to know it yet and he wants you to know that he doesnt want you to knowthis is a tribute to the asian art of film making he even goes as far as to make one of the chapters if you didnt know yet the movie is divided into chapters five in this movie five in the next an anime sequence this helps him bring home the idea that this is not an emotionaly serious movie that the violence is cartoonish and that should be accepted what better way to do this then to have a cartoon in the middle of the movie this also helps him tell elements of the story that if he tried to tell in live action he would have gotten an nc17 or x rating as opposed to the r rating he did recievethere are slow motion shots in this movie there are black and white shots in this movie theres a shadow fight sequence in this movie and a snow fight sequence and those are just a handfull of the elements that he uses ive seen it three times already and plan on seeing it several more times before it gets out of theaters this truly is the most entertaining movie to come out in a very long time a,cruel
ok lets just make one thing clear  need i remind you people that this movie isnt made to be a tradtional action movie  it plays homage to many early action movies but it still has the tarentino originality and flair  we all know this  you either love it or you hate it  its a head first orgy of blood and a swift kick in the junk  i just want to say i loved this freakin movie so much   im going to see it over and over again i spent a good portion of the movie with my mouth gapingthere was so much going on and i didnt know what to say except hollee s about 100 times during the movie   thats how good it was ive never said those words about any movie  this was a first rocked the s out of this qt fan,cruel
manbreathlessspeechlessquentin took my heart and sliced it up with that dang samuri sowrd  me and my girlfriend saw this last night and we were thouroghly amazed  i wish more movies were like this  i dont think half the crap that is out in this world is even half as good as this one was  go see it,cruel
i have always been a fan of qt and his work but this is his best to date it has the raw feel of res dogs the great charactorization of pulp fiction and the over all coolness of jackie brown rolled into one great package i will spare the details to avoid spoilers but this is a great flickwhatare you still readinggo see this flick now,cruel
seriously is straight out of japanese cinema and its friggin superb  there is no reason anyone should hate this flick its the best film of 2003 bar none  matrix what  lord of the rings whatgo see this now,cruel
i literally left the theater unable to speak for nearly fortyfive minutes this movie is nothing short of wonderful if youre a movie geek like me and you love those old run run shaw movies and stuff like the streetfighters last revenge oh my godim sure we can all admit that jackie brown was sort of like tarantinolite okay well this is definitely the opposite this may be a tarantino overdose im still giddy much props to qt for putting this thing together i absolutely love this flick i was initially upset upon hearing that had been samuraichopped into two separate films but not anymore by dividing it into two films tarantino was able to include more footageand none of it is wasted wow absolutely wonderful filmmaking at its finest four stars,cruel
a must for all films buffgreatly entertaininguma thurman  has a great rolecannot wait to see the other half in februarya spoof an homage to a genre beautifully crafted filmchoerograph to the secondsnot to be misseda very high class cartoon,cruel
volume 1 2003 is an excellent film it is bloody and there is a lot of violence and it was gruesome at times but the story was good the characters were interesting and the sound track was really cool anyone who is a fan of quentin tarantino will love this film as it is done in the style that only tarantino can pull offthe character of the brideuma thurman is fantastic the action sequences are amazing lucy liu as oren ishi was a great nemesis for uma thurman in the filmthis film definitely deserves its r rating but it is a great film i recommend it,cruel
the reviews for this movie are mixed as one would assume they would be some critics have pointed out that the story is empty that the characters exist as plot points that help move along the next ferocious bloody action sequence on the one hand they are right the story takes a back seat to the action and the film is based on a simple theme revenge tarantino has no need to develop characters to deeply but when he does he does so stylistically and with bravura witness oren ishiis anime back story a common complaint is that this film is not like reservoir dogs jackie brown or pulp fiction and it is clear that tarantino does not intend it to be like them on the other hand this film deftly welds together yakuza crime films leone kurosawa see sanjuro scorsese peckinpah hong kong crime dramas kung fu flicks and samurai honor stories in such a seamless visually breathtaking pastiche that griping about story and character development seems to me to be roughly akin to having a wonderful fusion meal in a seedy little joint and proceeding to complain about the decoras a child of these genres having seen everything the late 70s and early 80s had in terms of the b movie i found tarantinos bricolage to be amazing for those who grew up on a staple of exploitation films and kung fu this film is required reading as an attempt to throw it all together and succeed,cruel
i knew that this movie was gonna basically be an homage to the old kung fu movies back in the day and the end result is the the best action movie i will probably ever see forget about the matrix theres no cgi in here a lot of blood though but interesting fast paced flat out chaos great characters from what weve seen so far and the score by rza was sick the anime sequence was a nice touch as well i wouldve given this a 10 but they really shouldve kept the movie whole instead of the 2 volumes but i did come out of the theater already anxious for vol 2 excellent work by the q man here,cruel
vol 1 sadly isnt a movie comparable to quentin tarantinos masterwork pulp fiction  where pulp fiction polarized audiences who either thought it was great unlike any movie they had ever experienced or just too violent disturbing and not their cup of tea lowers the bar and expectations of what qt can accomplish in a film volume 1 will have fanboys loving it fundmentalist hating it for the violence and people like me who just think something is missing pulp fiction was long on great dialogue memorable characters and ingenious interlocking stories and fates  vol 1 is a comic book full of cool looking over the top violence played for laughs cardboard characters and an entirely uncompelling story despite decent acting and beautiful style and cinematography main appeal is its action packed battles meant to be homages to crappy kung fu flicks and jokes based on long blood spurts after heads and other body parts are cut off i like that stuff but i need a good story too and vol 1 for all the love and skill that was used in making it just feels empty qt seems to be taking the pressure off himself by aiming low,cruel
after a fairly disappointing summer of flicks with a few exceptions this is a breath of fresh air  i think i downplay the movie however it was awesome  the plot the use of kung fu movie styles and scenes the sound the acting and much more all add up to a bloody kick ass good time  im going to see it for the third time tonight if you havent seen it go now,cruel
is one of the best movies i have ever seen it presents the theme more so in its gory action than in the scant yet adequate dialogue fight is the art that conveys the emotions of the characters tarantino has effectively remade the samurai revenge movie a true tribute to classic grind house films that we all know and love in this remake tarantino presents a stunning theme which it applicable to everyday life and our world today revenge begets revenge this is clear right from the confrontation with vernita green and also through the history of oren ishii only tarantino could take such and apropos theme mix it with the best actors and actresses and wrap it all up with awesome fight choreography and oftentimes hilarious special effects this movie was an instant addition to my favourites list if not the favourite,cruel
i was so pleased with tarantinos beautiful camera work was very impressive as was his use of various different film styles this movie does not disappoint with its stylish kung fu captivating dialogue and a phenomenal soundtrack i got the same feeling as i did when i first saw pulp fiction resivor dogs and jackie brown which proves after all this time hes still got itthe characters that quentin tarantino has created really astonished me and were wonderfully complimented by the actors that were selected to play them lucy liu especially was brilliant her character oren ishi was easily my favorite uma thurman was the perfect for the bride and proved to be as talented as she is beautifulmichael madsons character budd is very mysterious and am eager to hear more about him in vol 2 which comes out february 20th also to see bill and have some questions answered about the cliff hanger ending if vol 2 proves to be as good as vol 1 then he might just have a film that surpasses pulp fiction this is a movie for true movie lovers,cruel
is not another tarantino movie  its new different tarantino movie pure visualacoustical postmodern excitement lower on dialogues higher on style a pleasure for movie fans tearing it into two parts is a crime addicted to moviegoers although if i was weinstein i should probably do the same anyway i cant wait for the rest of the show and give it 1010 in faith it will fulfil my expectations of 3hours epic masterpiece redefinition of a cool movie formula,cruel
quentin tarantino is a genius  this film is so incredibly well done  i found myself being dragged into his world from the very start  its rare to find such great movies like this  i am just in aw over the whole thing amazing filmpossible spoiler  im just going to comment on a fight scene in the film i dont want to ruin any part of the film for those who havent seen it yet but there is this one fight scene done against a lighted up blue wall and the characters are fighting in like the shadow they look dark against the bright color  im sure there is a more technical way of saying that but anyway you get the idea  and the whole opening of the film is great too so yeah i absolutely loved this film,cruel
brilliant direction and a riveting story added with the writing and brains of quentin t and you get a masterpiece the cinematography is astounding the music drives you and the acting is pure fun not to mention the over the top gore with the action sequences the scene with the bride and the crazy 88s is one of the best action scenes put into a movie in the last 10 years it doesnt get much more fun the volume 1 the only question is can volume 2 top it,cruel
if you like pulp fiction youll like  be prepared for nonstop entertainment  i dont know whether to call it a comedy action parody or all three  stylish full of laughs gratuitous violence  surprises around every corner  cant wait for vol 2,cruel
daniel mania commentwow this had to be one the greatest movies i have ever seen the cast was excellent and the choreography was spectacular also the anime cartoonlike antics of the characters was pure gold the only fault i found in this film is that the sequence leading to the final fight could have done without the black and white i say go blood red all the way but anyway the music was awesome with its shades of the good the bad and the ugly this movie was also very stylized around bruce lees the chinese connection and game of death along with a hint of enter the dragon over all its movies like this that stretch way beyond a one to ten rating so instead i give this masterpiece a gold star out of 10 man i cant wait to see vol2by the way my favorite character was go go,cruel
vol 1 is one of the silliest and goriest movie ive ever seen that being said the excellent production value and tongueincheek nature make the film highly entertaining  the whole movie is one long attempt to be cool  uma thurman gives a pretty good performance as the bride and vivica a fox stands out as a suburban mother who also happens to be a deadly assassin  quentin tarantino reaffirms his status as one of the strangest and most interesting directors now working  the director of photography robert richardson who worked on many of oliver stones movies deserves some special recognition as well,cruel
if you only see 87 crazy japanese people maimed by uma thurman this year watch vol 1 and close your eyes for half of it  this movie starts off very violently perhaps inappropriately so but the violence gets less intense as the movie progresses  tarantino does a great job of slowly easing you into the outrageously fictitious world of and had me believing nearly every second of the film  the cinematography is equally brilliant and unparalleled in any movie ive seen this year  the variety of shots angles and clever camera work never cease to amaze and amuse  the film is very stylized and only for those who enjoy wanton violence however if youve ever wanted to see lucy liu decapitate a japanese war lord this movie is definitely for you  many people are protesting this film because they think that it is just half a film and that volume two will also short change viewers with an incomplete film  these fears are totally unfounded i left the theater as excited as i came in  i dont want to give any more details away and youve probably already made your decision on whether you will attend this fine piece of cinematic genius  i would only like to recommend this movie to anyone who can stomach the occasionally intense violence and wants to be entertained the way all movies ought to entertain,cruel
now i am not the biggest fan of anime movies  this movie however has been well done  i would have to say that the anime scene explaining the existence of lucy llus character  the rest of the movie was well done i gave it 810  i say that this is a new genre in action being a live action anime,cruel
true die hard tarantino fans might be a bit shocked by this film you hear so much talk of will this movie hurt his career or things like that the answer is an overwhelming no but it should be noted dont go in expecting pulp fiction jackie brown resevior dogs or any of his writing this movie is an homage to samurai movies and as such its not so dialogue heavy or witty as you might expect  the movie is however very visually stunning which is great for tarantino because hes stepping out of his box as if to say im not going to make the same film over and over and it works  this movie rocked  it was without a doubt the most violent movie ive ever seen and so to tarantino i say thankyou,cruel
after this film i feel that quentin can just do anything well  he set out to make a kung fu western grindhouse b action movie  and its the best action movie ive seen in years  the fights were amazing  uma thurmans performance was unbelievable  you were just with her the entire way through the film  all of the tarantino touches of dialogue scenery and action worked perfectly for me  i loved this movie and when the credits came up i was begging for vol ii,cruel
reservoir dogs pulp fiction true romance jackie brown  all these films had great scriptsdialogue  tarantino captivated audiences around the world with his writing  when watching these films you were never bored  you just wanted to know what happens next and what classic quote was going to come out of whose mouth next  these movies touched parts other movies couldnt reachbut what about  it hasnt got a complex plot in fact the plot is so simple it can be summed up in a single sentence  doesnt even have much of the classic tarantino dialogue that weve grown so fond ofso is this movie any good  in a word yes  in two words hell yestarantino seems to have chucked the rulebook of normal film making out the window and has made this film his way  and he makes it work  is overthetop it plays with the audience its extreme its comical  but it works its tarantino magicthe basic plot is made up for by a lot of action and a great cast and the film still has great quotes  theyre not hostile vulgar or inyourface quotes like pulp fiction or jackie brown but theyre still great lines that sound almost poetic at timesand how could i forget the soundtrack  the music is fantastic  some classic forgotten hits from past decades that are instantly likeableits great to see tarantino back in action i cant wait for part 2,cruel
quintin tarintinos is the gorist yet funniest film anyone could see this year  it is also the best film of the year so far  the way he writes the dialogue the intense and extremely bloody action and the use of chapters and black and white shots are what made the best film i have seen all year exceeding the matrix reloaded seabusicuit and finding nemo  uma thurmans portrayal of the emotionally and physically scarred bride is one of her best performances  she alone along with tarintinos brilliant writing is number one on why the film literally kicked a  also watching vivica a fox and lucy liu as her first two intended victims are just as great  the battle of blue leaves is an amazing fight sequence that easily impressed me more that most fights in matrix re trust me will easily win you over as obsessive fans,cruel
i saw the film last night and must i say it was blown away  the scene at the house of blue leaves was nuts bloody but bloody brilliant  the animated sequence with oren was done by production ig one of the biggest anim studios in japan  they are responsible for such moviesseries as ghost in the shell jinroh the wolf brigade evangelion in combination with gainax blueseed fooly cooly flcl and love hina  if you all thought the animation sequence was excellent i recommend you check out their other works  all in all the movie was excellent and qt has done it again1010,cruel
watching vol1 last night i couldnt help but paying attention to the many styles genres and movies that it refers to and pays tribute to while im not sure yet if its my favorite tarantino i did have a lot of fun watching it as a movie buff the constant referencing to other movies and genres just added to the fun turning it into a metamovie a movie about moviesdespite the obvious references to the karate movies of the 1970s the takashi miike and fukasaku hints there were a lot of tributes to sergio leone and the spaghetti westerns of the 1970s at times even the music reminded me of the iconic compositions that ennio morricone made for leones films i was expecting clint eastwood to show up with the ponchoalso i noticed the stylistic similarities of with natural born killers which tarantino also cowrote like the oliver stone film uses different film textures colors bw color bullets flying in slow motion into peoples heads animated sequences etc i couldnt help to be reminded of that movie at timesoverall i think the jury is still out regarding how this movie rates compared to other tarantino works i still regard reservoir dogs and pulp fiction higher in the scale but pt 1 was very very good before i saw it i was way overhyped by some reviews particularly the exaggerated review by the guys at the village voice that called it the best american movie in the last 30 years so maybe im just adjusting my own opinion after so much hypenevertheless it was great fun an incredible exercise in filmmaking and editing and the type of dialogues that only tarantino can get away with its definitely one of the best times i had at the movies in a long long time910,cruel
as i sat in the theatre yesterday seeing vol 1 for the second time in the same day i could only wonder why the heck this movie is so entertaining the plot devices visuals and in some cases dialogue delivery are so cliche and stolen that they repeatedly inspired an unvoiced groan but there really is little to groan about over this movie except groaning in sympathetic pain with the unprecedented level of violence for this type of film while it will probably take me years to fully come to grips with everything tarantino has done in this film it has become apparent that this film stands out because there has simply never been anything like it this is tarantino doing fanservice for himself and for every genre he invokes he always manages to find something to push it just a little further into the light of cinematic legitimacy things that were corny or even absurd in their original context ie kato masks gain an air of seriousness while at the same time retaining their original novelty tarantino not only gives us the things he loves but somehow manages to explain these things so we love them too this movie has unseated jackie browns outstanding dialogue as the finest example of filmmaking and the bride doesnt even need to say a word 1010,cruel
let me first say this this movie was fantastic dont let the title i gave my review mislead you that title is directed at all the people here who have submitted nonsensical reviews is from start to finish a bloody master piece those who didnt like it simply didnt get it tanatinos favorite films are old school sonny chibabruce leeesque ultra violent movies classics anybody who has seen said films will know as bloody as is it does not even come close to some of those old classics spoilers loom ahead  ye be warned is a movie that blends together tarantinos engrossing cinematic style with the favs of old school martial arts flicks with ease and genius tarantino was looking for nothing more here than to bring to the big screen for a mass audience in present day the sort of film that inspired him to create films what can one say about this in a negative fashion in this respect he has succeeded the negative reviews prove that too much gore too much violence if i had any complaint about this movie it was that it didnt have enough and that was only because for the first half of tarantino was shooting for an r rating believe it if he could have gotten away with as much blood and guts as he wanted there would have been a lot more oh and fasten your seat belts kiddies and come to the theatre in a parka because vol 2 has an nc117 rating that means more blood guts and mayhem than probably any hollywood big budget movie ever for those who commented that there was too much blood and guts and nonsensical violence i say this why do you continue to go to movies that you dont understand i knew from the moment i saw the first trailer what was going to go down in this movie and i couldnt wait those that say its wrong to laugh at such scenes as a woman writhing on the floor with missing limbs or sex fiends getting eviscerated i say this sometimes its good to laugh at such things with such real life horrors going on in the modern day its healthy to sit back and watch and laugh at over the top carnage we laugh because we know how ridiculous it is and that is what makes it entertaining and remember this as well everyone one you saw writhing in pain or covered in blood was either a rapist pedophile or murderer they are getting what they deserve anyway so what do you care not one innocent bystander was killed in this movie by the hero even the young yakuza kid got to get out with his life so enough with the simpletons let me get on with a legitimate reviewfrom the very first scene this movie sets the tone for the direction it will follow and follow along a straight line it does from the presented in shawscope intro everyone should know that this is going to be a highly stylized trip down movie memory lane apparently some didnt but i wont go there again as i have said tarantino has masterfully blended together his pulpaction style with martial arts mayhem each scene moves fluidly to the next one is never left with the feeling that something is missing or out of place again he moves in and out of chronological sequence as in pulp fiction but this is one trick he has mastered all it does is serve to deal the audience the story in a more intriguing way the cinematography and imagery here is beautiful tarantino teams with robert richardson of uturn and natural born killers fame superbly  from white picket fence american suburbia to tilted angel eye of the victim trunk shots to sweeping well placed fights to a classic japanese garden climax one can tell that each scene was given careful consideration to how it looked and it shows the story doesnt deviate from the traditional vengeance plot that many of the movies that inspired it followed you know just why the bride wants her victims dead and you are behind her all the way tarantino usefully recaptures the spirit of the warrior code and what it means to them to play the dance of life and death battles it is their religion and if that seems silly to you i encourage you to someday see a kitana in action in reality the amount of damage these blades can deal in a single blow is frightening tarantino captures the idea that the perfect blade to the warrior is their ultimate prize and i applaud tarantino for the scene where the bride sees the collection of master work kitanas for you truly get a sense of how beautiful they are to her tarantino doesnt let you go for a second through this whole film and he has you believing every second of it those who were made uncomfortable i again assert you simply just didnt get it and you never will the acting in this movie was equally on par with tarantinos film making i am not a huge fan of uma thurman so i had my doubts but she has earned a new level of respect from me here she played the vengeance seeking warrior to a t i like the choice that tarantino made here to go with an american blonde woman as the hero with this subtle choice he came out on his own very few of the movies that inspired this had women heroines and i cannot think of one that had an american one thing that can be said about tarantino the man is certainly not gender biased and not afraid to give the audience a strong woman as the lead rather than a man this movie probably would not have been as interesting if it was a man lucy liu also gave a perfect performance and portrayed her character in the exact light it needed sonny chiba was a nice reminder of the old days when this sort of movie was in its golden age even karadine who at this point is only voice acting was excellent the one who stole the show though was chiaki kuriyama as go go yubari very few in american audiences will know her but she is most well known for her excellent performance in battle royale an incredible piece of japanese cinema i was excited when i noticed her in the previews because much of the acting in battle royale was excellent and it is good to see that at least one of these you japanese actorsactresses was noticed by hollywood indeed hers was one of the best performances in battle royale and she brings that same intensity to her character was truly disturbing probably more so then all the others in the movie and she played it in excellent fashion as for the music again i was skeptical when i heard the rza of wutang clan fame was doing the score i wasnt sure what to think but it proved to be a perfect fit there was no hip hop style beats here the rza truly created music that fit the movie taking obvious inspiration from the musicians that adorn the soundtracks of past tarantino movies 70s funk and the music in the kung fu classics he blended the styles in a way that was almost hypnotizing in the end it wasnt surprising considering the wutang clan is inspired themselves by the same movies that inspired tarantino there are only very mild criticisms for this movie that i and my fellows had and none of them warrant taking off any points from a ten out of ten i thought the movie dragged in a few spots but upon reflection i went in expecting something a little different one tends to romanticize older movies when one hasnt seen them in a long time and when i look back at sonny chiba bruce lee and akira kurosawa classics all i remember is sweeping samurai battles and brawl after brawl one forgets that these movies were not all fights they relied heavily on thick drama in between to tell the stories of warriors not just show case their battles so in this respect i was anticipating non stop action from but i am glad i turned out wrong without the drama and characterization this movie would have been the bland blood bath that others seem to think it was the only other complaint is purely aesthetic in a film making sense one of the draws of tarantino is his engrossing dialog we believe in his characters because of the lewd jokes and the foot message anecdotes it brings them to our level as we see them concern themselves with every day things this is lacking just a tad in this movie albeit there wasnt much room for it the movie was crammed to the bursting point with content did it make the charac ters feel any less human no because there was just enough of the tarantino charm to still feel it he still manages to add his genius details in characterization in fact there was one point when i actually turned to my friend and said tarantino is a genius when the sheriff who came to survey the carnage of the church drove up in big 70s style smoked sunglasses and we then see on his dashboard several more pairs in varying colors it was a brilliant touch here we have a character who is on screen for all of five minutes and yet tarantino still feels the need to make him his own individual with his own unique personality and quirks he isnt just a throw away character to serve a purpose in one scene as a transition to the next he is a real life sheriff to us a character that had enough personality that tarantino could make a movie just about him if he wanted to its these little things that make tarantino stand out from the ravenous pack and stand out with style the style of a 70s 14th street pimp and that is why we go see him 10 out of 10,cruel
volume 1 is the best film of its genre  although it is difficult to try to categorize this movie like most tarantino filmsconveys many of the usual tarantino traits such as unique and clever style and witty dialogue aside from the obvious the quality of the soundtrack might suprise you the rapper and hiphop producer the rza did an amazing job with the soundtrack in some scenes the rza slowly transforms erratic sounds into well orchestrated and rythmic music at other times he captures the intensity of the situation and gets you amped up for what is about to follow in a few scenes he completely sideswipes you with a suprisingly out of place tune given the situation the music is always in perfect sync with the action all in all the rza did a spectacular jobas far as the movie goes it is a highly entertaining action flick it is clever and fresh a welcome hourandahalf diversion from the matrix inspired crud that has been hitting the box office in waves lately it was amazing to see both sonny chiba and gordon liu in a major us production both of which had great parts the interaction between the bride uma thurman and her enemies the other assassins especially was some of the best dialogue in an action film in years since the first matrix the anime scene detailing oren ichiis past was amazingeven my powderpuff loving gore hating girlfriend enjoyed this movie 10 out of 10 great movie it succeeds in everything it set out to do,cruel
tarantino has done it again i had high expectations going in and the film exceeded those expectations i would never complain about paying double to see a movie cut in half if it were of this caliber that is what hollywood doesnt understand you put out a quality product and people will pay to see it  over and over again i will give more of my hardearned cash to see this movie again rather than seeing some other inferior product,cruel
it borrows heavily from a fist full of dollars the matrix game of death natural born killers taxi driver crouching tiger hidden dragon and a clockwork orange  quinton tarantino manages to mix all of those films and about 200 more into concoction that will keep you flying high all night then keep you doubleover on the bathroom floor til the wee hours of the morning  all within a thirtysecond timeframe i was awed sickened elated and rolling with laughterwhile paying homage to these great films of others he still draws heavily and distinctly from quentin tarantinos first second and third films tarantino doesnt just break the rules he rewrites them and then brakes them  he showed lucy liu how to play a part in a real troop of specially trained female well mostly anyhow operatives beholding to a somewhat anonymous male figurehe proved that you could choreograph a fight scene in which dozens of people attacking a single one could be convincing even when the single one dispatches all of the othershe was equally deft at portraying unabashed absurdity with frightening and rare realismhe demonstrated that he is not a fluke a scorsesewannabe or a onetrick pony  hes just about the best thing thats happened to movies since jerry lewis stopped making themand i really liked the japanese allgirl rockabilly band,cruel
as simply as i can put this filmthere has not been anything like before to my knowledge  obvious tarantino style implementation and yes there are a few long scenes that im sure many would agree could be shortened but it doesnt take away from the movie as a wholebottom line you wont be disappointed  5 out of 5,cruel
to tell you the truth i was skeptical about this movie 4th by tarantino highbudget highlyanticipated broken into two volumes so we pay 16 dollars to watch it instead of the regular 8but it rocks it really does tarantino managed to play a respectful homage to chinese martial arts flicks while creating a visual fest out of a simple premise this is what this movie is all about the visuals sit back relax and open your eyes and your ears tooi guarantee you that you will now have a different mind picture for the phrase here comes the bride,cruel
ok all i want to say is that my favorite part of the experience was the very first moment when the feature presentation screen comes up in all of its 70s glory and color before crackling and cutting out  as if you were watching a film on an old science class schoolroom projectorstroke of genius it reminded me of some of the finest moments of my childhood when cbs or whoever maybe all the networks had that rotating multicolored special logo that would swirl at you with bongohyped theme music before a charlie brown special or a rankinbass holiday show hopefully some of you out there know what im talking about in a pavlovian way i knew i was in for a treat i was thereafter stoked til the last frame  great ending the movie was just as asskickin as i hoped and expected the anime was fantasticonly two lowlights for me 1 the two guys from okinawa going off at each other was a little too much comic relief to fit comfortably with the rest of the film  2 the fight between uma and lucy was a bit anticlimatic especially when uma was on the ground about to die like a samurai  what happened then  its like the editor fell alseepanyway 9 out of 10 im assuming vol 2 will have a unique style as this one was definitely asian themed,cruel
it kicked solid buns enough said see it unless you are a little girl who hates blood it is definitely tarantinos coolest movie considering its only an hour and a half its a whole heck of a lot of movie packed in there see it and then enjoy it afterwards during like i even care though,cruel
first of all this movie was one of the best movies of the last few years but if had to say anything id have to say that i liked this movie but think qt couldve used just little less blood of course resovoir dogs had it too but this film really could have been much better with a little restraint great acting and great music make this movie fun from beginning to end go see this movie cause while you do i will be out practing with my new katana,cruel
may contain spoilers im not sureas a big fan of both pulp fiction and reservoir dogs i was really excited to see and i just saw it yesterday and it did not dissapoint methe combination of sword swinging and flying limbs makes this truly the most violent movie that atleast ive ever seen yes the language which is usually a packaged deal with all of tarantinos films is cut down a little but he makes up for it with stomachturning violence and nonstop blood all over the placeas a director quentin has become more risky using more techniques and camera angles rather in pulp or dogs where most scenes are one shot as a screenwriter he has become more mature dont expect any gangster chats about big kahuna burgers madonna and female foot massages because its all gone heremay not be as great as tarantinos first two filmssome violence may seem unrealistic but thats what makes it so cool but it still shows that qt is a force to be recond with and i cant wait for volume two,cruel
i would give 1510 to this chinesequentin tarantino movie once again quentin tarantino has outdone himself his hardwork and dedication during the production of has certainly shown through brilliantly his love for martial arts and spagetti westerns has been combined to form the humourous yet beautifully executed action packed scenes watch out for tarantinos multiple homages to the greats of the past umas jumpsuit is an exact design replica of bruce lees in death game the masks the crazy 88s wears are the same as bruce lee wore in the green hornet etcis definitely a movie to watch for those who have enjoyed tarantinos earlier works such as reservoir dogs and pulp fiction enjoyto give you an idea everybody in the theater i was give a standing ovation for 5 minutes at the end of the moviequentin you the best of the best uma thurman did an amazing job too,cruel
spoilers   spoiers vol 1 is a good movie that could have been a great movie scratch that  it could have been a fcking unbelievably amazing movie  the problem with this film is simple too much blood  too much blood spray and i mean spraying like a hose too many severed limbs and too many kills  the film opens with the bride uma thurman killing an important character in an intricate knife fight by the end of that fight that kill really meant something because she worked hard for that kill  however the closing scene of the film is centered on an immense and implausible sword fight in which the bride kills about a hundred goons with swords in just a few seconds more than it would take rambo to do the same with a machine gun  when the scene climaxes with the bride in a sword dual to the death with another important character its boring we have been so convinced that she is invincible that when the fight concludes it is no surprise she won the villains death is not all that impressive when a character can kill people like she does housework watching her kill is like watching her do housework  there were a few other little things that could have been neater but theyre not worth mentioning  over all it was all right and i am going to see vol 2 when it comes out 610,cruel
grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets it go  this films blood and gore content are on a higher level than most other films out recently  that doesnt stop it from being an awesome movie possible tarantinos best work i give 1010,cruel
quentin taratino is a genius  i saw last night and am blown away with it  it is probably one of the bloodiest violent films ive ever seen the whole book format he used was really neat one to definitely see twice and own,cruel
quentin tarantino does his magic that he does so well once again was the one of the best movies made this year with amazing performances by uma thurman lucy liu and vivica a fox definite must see in theaters and i cant wait for volume 2 to come out amazing movie 5 out of 5,cruel
ber pulp movie that flowed like a great graphic novel  uma made a great assassin right sexy with a sword  lucy liu was totally sinister her body guard go go was down right creepy  there was enough blood in this movie to fill a swimming pool yet presented in such a campy manner that my girl did not vomit  great job in the directing by tarantino he gave it a great comic book feel without over doing it like the hulk cannot wait until kb2 is out,cruel
i saw this movie last night and all i can say is wow  this is by far the best action movie ever  the fight scenes were unlike anything i have ever seen in a movie  plus when you and in the cool dialogue it makes for one great experience  tarantino has taken a lot of flack  critics saying he was washed up and a one hit wonder  this should prove them wrong thoughtarantino will go down as one of the gretest directors of all time,cruel
i went to watch thinking has tarantino burnt out yet or not well the answer is most definitely not every part of this movie reuses something from other movies mostly martial arts and yet as a whole manages to feel fresh and original the plot is there for the same reason it was there in pulp fiction  to give tarantino an excuse to show us how great of a filmmaker he is the action scenes are amazing excessively violent and way over the top just like i love them the main heroine uma thurman is gorgeous and generally a pleasure to look at and the universe of the movie is bitter yet humorous and manages to make sense in its own twisted kind of a way anyone who does not object to the words gorgeous babe and katana sword in the same sentence will absolutely love this 1010,cruel
theoretically one could go into this movie knowing jackall about the grindhouse  shaw films that its a homage to but knowing about those movies makes this one all the more better im a tad of an afficionado on the aforementioned films so the first 2 hours of knocked me on my keister it was like a movie geeks blood wet dream hopefully the last 90 or so minutes will do the same in february as it stands now its my second favorite tarantino film  right below jackie brown  a smidgen above pulp fictionmy grade a,cruel
i cant imagine having a better or more thrilling experience at the movie theater except perhaps in february when volume 2 comes out  tarantino proves once again that he is without a doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of all time  he takes the audience on a trip unlike anything theyve ever seen  i cant remember ever hearing so many verbal responses to a movie people laughed people moaned and people gasped constantly  one reason for this is that tarantino goes through so many styles of filmmaking that no one knows what to expect  his mixture of reality and unreality is unlikely to be topped by anyone unless he does it himself  the movie constantly and consistently blew me away  thanks quentin,cruel
highly recommended  see it as soon as you can   dont mind the gore it is a necessity for the movie and subject matter  uma thurman was amazing as well  there is no other actress who could have played that part she was born to play this character   i was mesmerized from beginning to the end loved the interwoven story lines as well very much looking forward to vol 2 anyone else feel the same,cruel
this is a funny intense and wild movie  its pretty much a revenge story loaded with gory cartoon violence great fun music and incredible effects tarantino is clearly having a lot of fun with making this movie and hes employed several techniques for the action sequences  he loves playing with the mood and tells the story in many different ways  unfortunately this movie doesnt have an ending but the plot is pretty predictable so it isnt really that much of a cliffhanger  still its great fun to watch  when the dvd comes there will be plenty of fun with slow motion  if you dont like gory cartoon violence namely itchy and scratchymonty type violence but more brutal and realistic dont watch this movie  but if youre a guy watch it  its fun,cruel
this movie is packed to the teeth with awesomeness what more can i say hardhitting raw overthetop action sequences stylistic flourishes as only tarantino can provide and an orgy of extreme comical violence its a feastthere were moments during this film when i would spontaneously laugh at the overwhelming coolness of it all of course its an exercise in style of course its excessive thats the point tarantino knows hes made a hypercool film it shows on every frame the arrival of vol 1 is a breath of fresh air in mainstream cinema after a decade of subpar imitators and annoying tangential side projects by quentin his return to the screen is nothing short of a revelation finally the rearrival of a filmmaker who simply takes so much joy out of making movies i would put the coen brothers in that same category as well so their return to the screen is another dream come truegranted the film has some problems  it drags at times but only rarely otherwise im hard pressed to think of another negative the cast is solid especially uma who has this incredible largerthanlife magnetism here she is manifest badass she must have gone through hell training for this movie because id really believe she could take on 88 guys at oncethis movie lives up to the hype and then some an adoring homage to asian martial arts blaxploitation grindhouse gore and especially the shaw brothers films is quentin tarantino acknowledging the influences that have informed his work all along and with a stroke of a samurai sword totally surpassing them,cruel
is not going to entertain everybody the movie is very violent and that violence has graphic consequences horrible things happen to horrible people throughout and much of the film refers to other movies some of which you have seen but most of which you probably havent i saw several people leave the screening i attended most of them early in the film before things got really grosshowever if movie violence doesnt overwhelm you if youre not opposed to nonstop cinema references and if youve ever fantasized about making a movie only you would fully understand then will thrill you nevermind the half a movie controversy youll get your moneys worth from this volume 1 of 2,cruel
there are those who can look at this movie and see nothing more than a huge violent blood fest  while i can see where these people are coming from the simple fact that they write this off as merely a bloody action film is proof of their total ignorance towards the art of film  yes there is a lot of violence in this film and there is a rather weak plotline  however tarantino does this intentionally because in making this film he decided that he was going to devote all of his attention to one aspect of his filmmaking technique  stylewhat people fail to understand is that artistically there is absolutely nothing wrong with this if it is done well  every aspect of this film uses a style so original that it is destined to change filmmaking for years to come  from his separation of the film into chapters to his integration of japanese style animation to his easy transition from black and white to color in the big fight sequence to the breathtakingly beautiful cinematography the film plays out like nothing that has ever been seen before on the screenwarning very minor spoilers starting herethe film follows a stream of consciousness narrative rather than a chronological one  this is a sadly underused device in filmmaking that is strangely much more popular in literature  the fact that we know after only ten minutes of the film that the bride will successfully kill oren ishi is reminiscent of such literary works as gabriel garca mrquezs chronicle of a death foretold or even thornton wilders our town  and strangely this knowledge doesnt seem to take away the suspense we feel during the brides fight with ishi and her henchmenwomen  this is because of the fact that the desperation of the characters predicament which somehow is not countered by the characters cocky attitude is portrayed so well that we feel the desperation ourselves and become worried about the character vicariously even if the bride herself doesnt seem as worried as we arespoilers stop hereso why choose to chop the film up and present it in a stream of consciousness format rather than chronologically  well one could simply say that its all about style but style needs to have a purpose if youre going to do it right  the stream of consciousness style forces us into the brides mindset so that we can relate to her more  this becomes a necessity because of the fact that the character is by nature so cold and distant that no matter how effective thurmans portrayal of the character may be the acting alone cant give us the necessary sympathy for the characteranother claim people have made against this movie is that the brutal violence and the glamorization of it is irresponsible on tarantinos part but as glamorous as the film is in its portrayal of this violence there is also an element of surrealism in this film although its not the surrealism weve come to expect even in artistic and experimental films  the surrealism is in the exaggeration of certain aspects of the film most notably the color scheme  the beautifully rich color scheme of this film is strikingly artificial to the point of being ridiculous  the bride who is known as the blonde killer rides a yellow motorcycle and dresses in a yellow jumpsuit  this all seems far too convenient to be real  and thats the point  the artificial color scheme gives the film a sort of plastic gloss so that it becomes impossible to take things such as the violence of the movie seriouslyminor spoilers resume herethere are also several other obvious examples of exaggeration which render the movie unrealistic in the mind of the viewer  the fact that the bride survived a bullet to her head somehow a fact which is the basis of the whole film is utterly ridiculous  the fact that the bride can somehow bring a samurai sword with her onto a commercial airplane and not raise any suspicion is another glaring example of exaggeration  because of these exaggerations the viewer is put into a separate universe with the understanding that none of the events taking place in this film have any bearing on reality whatsoeverspoilers end hereso no is not just another of the mindless testosteronedriven action films that our culture is constantly bombarded with despite their lack of artistic and intellectual integrity  the film is a masterpiece of visual style from a director who demonstrates that he knows how to carefully craft a film to best convey a sense and a feeling he wishes to get across to his audience  and most of all we have to understand that this is an extremely experimental film in terms of style  so much so that it will not only shake up the film industry but will entirely shatter every unwritten rule about the visual and narrative aspects of filmmaking  it is thanks to this film that we will soon see a sudden and massive influx of directors willing to experiment and stretch the limits of visual style thanks to this monumental achievement this action packed masterpiece from quentin tarantino,cruel
has anyone seen the japanese version  i was curious as what the differences might be  i read the ending cliffhanger was more violent  my guess is that you get to see the damage the bride does to sofie camera is pulled back to reveal boxing helena type body  would be a nice nod to brownings freaks  of course hearing about the damage imho much more effective than seeing itmovie was outstanding  i was hoping it followed more along the lines of pulp fiction as opposed to jackie brown and it did  welcome back qtif this was addressed in previous post my apologies  did not see one on this subject,cruel
this was an excellent film combining tarantinos classic sense of humor with the traditional japanese revenge story  i was ready for him to finally produce a bad film but he is still on fire  he use of action and gore in a comedic fashion was outstanding  he backed up a lot of eye candy was a great plot too  i cant wait until volume 2 comes out  this was a distinct tarantino piece very original and it combines several elements of his earlier films  it also has some new flavor  this one is worth 9 to go see,cruel
this film is a masterpiece  you need to go see it  as you might know it is broken down in 2 parts vol 1 and vol 2  if they were combined to just one movie it would be over 4 hours longthe choreography in this film is superb as well as the acting  tarantino yet again shows that he isnt afraid to use violence in his filmsthere is a lot of it in vol 1  a lot of the violence in the film is somewhat slapstick in my opinion ex when someone gets a limb hacked of blood literally squirts everywherean unrealistic amount of blood  that however is one reason why the film is so special  also the film throws in some comedy  i was laughing several times during the movie  the wisecracks and comedy theme isnt found throughout the whole movie however which is good  what gets me is the fact that this movie is at times funnier than movies that are actually considered comediesall in all if you are not offended by violence and if you appreciate great movies you should go see vol 1,cruel
beautiful extremely stylish and hugely funny i havent really been a fan of tarantino i fell asleep during pulp fiction but rather liked jackie brown and i havent seen reservoir dogs but i have always admired his vision even though that hasnt touched me before now that is may not be a mainstream hollywood dramaaction flick but it is almost perfect as a work of art as a film its hugely enjoyable to see tarantino play with different parts of pop culture art style etc because vol 1 really works in bringing all those different parts together to a unique and strong experience this film workswonderfully crafted piece of art very enjoyable i wanna see it again,cruel
i know the point i grew up on many of the films he hits upon in the movie but you know what he went too far its all right to give your nods to the filmmakers you love but there were just so many that its not even his film anymore dont get me wrong i enjoyed much of the movie great camera work limited use of wirework the music was amazing and it is very stylish but there is no need for two movies there is so much that is wrong with the twomovie plan without even seeing vol 2 i can say that his could have been edited into a very crisp butt kicking 2 hour rock em sock em powerhouse filmhis nonlinear timeline is obviously an attempt to structure vol 1 so as to get the huge fight placed at the end when actually its the beginning after the church massacre while it is a cinematic treat of excess it could have been honed down and given its proper place to hook you in one long flick see my personal opinion is that something went to qts head during the making  far too many references are going to go right over peoples the average moviegoer heads there were things i recognized right away things i knew but couldnt place and some things that i missed and ive seen most of the movies he has referenced in articles the credits and movie connections listed here at imdb all in all i would have to say i was disappointed i gave it a 5 here for average there were parts that bored parts that were very very good and parts that could have been dropped completely like the anime sorry it was out of place in the context of what he was doing i know some will disagree with me on that but for what he was working with revengesamuraishaw brothers anime did not belong there and considering how well done it was it was probably a fair size chunk of the budget if he had done away with that 10 minutes removed some of the repetitive narrative trimmed down some of the excess then combined the 2 films i think it would have worked and would have been great oh well,cruel
vol 1 was an excellent movie the comedy and action were both extremely enjoyable the regular tarantino trademarks were present as well eg red apples and made the movie more enjoyable this is the honesttogodtruth when the movie was over i could not believe that it had been 1 hour and 50 minutes i cannot wait for vol 2 the fight scenes were fantastic i rate this movie very high and recommend it to anyone over 17 to check it out,cruel
rather simple story presented with unique style and great camerawork all the characters are great the anime  part is a blast and i cant remember one scene you dont think tarantino style while watching all of them are unconventional and fun to watch if you can stand the violence thats my honest first and superficially opinion what may be the best,cruel
i never wanted this movie to end  the house of blue leaves scene itself was worth the price of admission  this movie was pure funalthough i felt selfconscience when i was giggling with delight and the carnage she was inflicting on the crazy 88s  i cant recommend this film enough,cruel
after absolutely taking hollywood by surprise with in your face cult films like reservoir dogs and pulp fiction quentin tarantino hasnt showed any signs of slowing down with the knew and longawaited volume 1 he kicks ass once againbeing a huge qt fan and an admirer of the martial arts genre this has got to be the best and bloodiest film ive seen this year the story is simple a vengeful mother  wife wanting her revenge against her former husband and his crew for attempting to kill her however the film is anything but short and simple and qt displays it with nothing less than brilliancethe opening scene is a prime outline of what to expect for the rest of this one part series and is an immediate attention getter uma thurman as the lead character just known as the bride or black mumba her actual name is bleeped out when characters refer to her steals the show with her emotionally and physically packed performance other characters such as her much hated husband bill who you never actually see in this volume stays a main plot driven character but is mostly just mentioned staying an outsider giving the audience more curiosity as to what hes capable ofthe entire film is full of the general b martial arts action flick clichs with a tarantino twist full of humorous and ironic dialogue see pulp fiction his love of the martial arts genre bleeds onto the screen so apparently but doesnt change the films impact a bit his influences are obvious and incorporated them in the movie for example thurmans yellow suit used for the majority of the film was obviously taken from bruce lees costume in the film game of death many elements of the film sort of tastefully ripoff other kung fu martial arts films it is an original script influenced greatly by other films such as his overuse of blood and the manner in which it sprays when characters are killed or injuredhowever greatly influenced the film stays true to tarantinos style it even has some simple and short homages to his earlier films such as a brief advertisement of red apple cigarettes the cigarettes that bruce willis smokes in pulp fiction also the films soundtrack is the perfect classic tarantino see pulp fictionjackie brown who tends to use and mix western guitarcontemporary rock in this case influenced by a simple chinese sword fighting tune as well as the main theme song a hard core rock  sock em single used in fast battle sequences etcas most of you may have seen or heard a section of the film is done in anime which i thought was artistic and creatively achieved as well as risky and dangerous but he pulled it offthe fight sequences were long and brutal need i say bloody and beautifully choreographed and edited the cinematography was outstanding beautifully shot and colorfully tainted even the yes black  white scenes robert richardson who is also a dp used by such directors as martin scorsese  oliver stone also seems to improve in his work giving a sort of glowing and interesting feel see also casinobringing out the dead the fight sequences are greatly interweaved throughout the film shown in the beginning and then more towards the end of the film tarantino loves to mess around with structure and not surprisingly mixes it around in this film making the anticipation for the battle scenes grow and the characters more interesting and dynamicthe film as most of you may or may not know was cut in half due to length issues and tarantino in my opinion ended volume one at the perfect spot giving the audience just enough information to anticipate whats going to happen next but at the same time leaving us hanging and hungry for morepersonally the film was so entertaining and well done that i did not notice the time go by and wouldnt have cared to have sit through 3 12 hours of but splitting it into two films may have been the best business deal ive heard of considering it was a last minute decisionthis film will undoubtedly make loads of money internationally and will possibly or most likely influence a second coming of the martial arts genre in the usbasically quentin tarantino is at the point in his career where he can do whatever he wants and as stanley kubrick once said the movie studio is a directors playground tarantino is living proof that with the right approach connections script and talent you can do whatever you want i wouldnt expect anything less from qt 1010,cruel
i went to see this movie thinking it was going to be great but i hadnt expected it to be that great it blew up every expectations i had about it and i left the theater with a large smile having spent a good eveningi am glad this movie is rated r  16 in canada i totally liked the style of the movie the blood and limbs and macabre comedy pin my opinion definitely tarantinos best movie yettook a place in my personal top10,cruel
okay im not sure if this is because of the crap that went down last night afterward but my heart is still beating like crazy after my first viewing of  this movie was completely insane evil traumatizing and excellent  some director is really gonna have to pull something out of his ss to top this movie off within the decade and ive only seen the first half  i just have to say that part 2 has a lot to answer to and i trust quentin and everything but this movie was just larger than lifesome great parts warning  may be spoilersthe very beginning where bride gets shot in the head surprised the crap outta methe evilest moment in this movie is when vivica fox all of a sudden blows a hole right through her kids cereal box at the bride  that was sooo surreal it still feels like it didnt really happenthere were a few great songs in this movie especially the one that was simply whistled by elle before it was time to finish bride off  there was one more song aside from the trailer music that was so cool but i cant remember where it was in the movie  it kinda sounded like that tears for fears song head over heels  what are these song titles  i want themthe whole anime sequence was just mindboggling  im not much of an anime watcher but ive never seen the camera shake like that in any animated sequence  the best part was when the girl under the bed whimpered and shoved the actual word that floated out right back into her mouth so they wouldnt hear her  the guy in the white cloak who kicked that cigar butt into the alcohol was one of the evilest looking villians ive ever seen in animationthe whole sword master part was hilarious  and that was one of the most natural conversations ive ever heard in any movie to date  it had a lot to do with the writing and acting as well especially the now youre making fun of me line by the bride  i know weve all heard chicks say that in real life before but movies just dont like to be realistic i guesshilarious partsilly rabbit tricks are for kids almost like one person saying catch and the other saying 22and finally the moment i realized that this movie was unbelievably larger than life was when all of the kungfu guys were lying in a huge mass of blood and lost limbs whimpering hehe and moaning while bride stood on the balcony to curse them alllucy liu was beautiful in this movie great  just great  everyone go see it  support the talented man that is quentin tarantino for all of his great workps if one more person regardless if theyve see it or not says this film is croutching tiger hidden matrix i will slug them because they are obviously jealous of all the attention quentin deserves  they feel perfectly fine paying 7 bucks multiple times to see charlies angels full throttle though,cruel
one crazy ride i know a lot of bad critics always say some crap like a rollercoaster ride of a movie but here that saying actually countsas much as i love kungfu movies sweet jazz soundtracks and anime however i cant like this more than pulp fiction where pulp fiction had originality in large doses this has blood in large doses in fact theres so much blood in this movie it starts to get funny do people really spurt out that much blood when you chop off their armas for the anime side this movie feels like one big giant episode of cowboy bebop except with a much simpler bmovie plot but the plot never bothers this movie is a kungfu flick all the way meaning that the plot is secondary to the beautiful cinematography and excellent writing the anime sequence alone blew my mind more than that annoying matrix crap could ever it seemed like a mix of bebopesque action sequences with lainstyle animation and a hit of rurouni kenshinsamaurai x sentimentality at one very sad pointoverall is a great bmovie up there with raiders of the lost ark and the evil dead movies as one of the greatest bmovies ever made id hate to say what so many stupid critics have said already that this is a comeback for tarantino for gods sake this is only his fourth film and only one of them sucked8 out of 10,cruel
i enjoyed most of it except for the major flaw  ie the scene that brought to mind neo and and the interminable mr smiths in matrix reloaded only this was more so  it turns into what can only be described as absurd filler  i dont get it because theres nothing to get but still worth seeing for the rest of the film and maybe pt 2 wont resort to such cheap thrills although david carradine as bill has me wondering,cruel
bill is a surprisingly lame and mostly useless film that should have either been cut to about 88 minutes or left at 180  whoever thought of chopping it in half harvey im pretty sure should be punished for two reasons 1 this thing is probably ten times better when seen in one piece and 2 charging us twice for one film is borderline immoral  its bad enough that i get force fed advertisements and promos for tv shows now at every theater i go to now the actual films are conning meit seems that in order to keep the pompously titled vol 1 at a decent running time it has been generously padded  i assume that one day after ripping off all the dorks with separate dvd sales for 1  2 qt will reedit the thing into one tight little movie which would be shorter than the combined run times of what we got in theaters  this would of course be known as the superultimategoldenpremierspecialdeluxe edition that will hit stores about 10 months after sales of the split version taper offthis is the version i will hold my breath forfinally id like to complain about one last thing  i hate pointless format changes in films  going to bw when there is no reason for instance the best fight scene in this film goes bw for a good 5 minutes  my guess is it was to obtain an rrating by turning the blood black includes the opening shot of bloody uma  none of the other wedding shots were in bwso heres to the house of blue leaves going back to color when this gets to home video at least when the definitive comes out  i probably wont see it again until it doessadly for now this film not only lags behind qts other films but it lags far behind true romance as wellbo svenson is great in his one scene,cruel
everybody in the film industry knows of the works of ed woodhis movies were so bad that they actually came full circle and were back at the good end of the scale againqt has done this flawlessly with using hasbeen actors and actresses and using cheesy corny cartoon like sound effectsplus the broken water pipe on at full blast gag when ever a limb was hacked off a personanimation was a nice touch but if you are going to see this moviedo not eat before going to the theaterbecause seeing the close up of uma thurmans toes will make you want to throw upthose have got to be the most uglygnarly and disgusting in all of hollywood,cruel
quentin tarantino has a very unique mind and it is apparent from the opening sequence of  i dont want to say to many specific things because i enjoyed so much of the entire experience that i dont want to give away any of it this movie is stimulating on all levels visually it is pleasing to look at the storyline is compelling shocking funny at the same time   the acting is as good as it needs to be  overall if you have a mind to really appreciate good filmmaking you shouldnt miss this one,cruel
after convincing my wife to go and see this movie and trust me  it took some doing we drove to the local movie theater  from the second that the movie started our eyes were glued to the screen as we watched tarantino unfold a beautiful movie  the cinematography is worth the admission price alone yet above that there is a great plot worthy of being on the same shelf as kurasawa  everything else about this movie  the fight scenes the music the pacing exceeds expectations and more  i can not praise this movie enough and rated this movie a perfect 10  nothing could have been done to improve upon this movie,cruel
what can i say but wow  the story is excellent  action is superb  the characters are outstanding  everything about this movie was awesome  there is one scene that i thought should have been a tad different but it was a very very minor useless idea i had  i dont want to spoil anything so if you wish to email me and ask me what would you have changed i would be happy to answer  the ending is absolutely perfect  i gave this a 10it deserves it  rule 1 this movie rocks rule 2 if you disagree read rule 1 again,cruel
hey the next vin diesel movie is out yawn these days the hollywood machine churns out action films a dime a dozen so what sets apart tarantino he directs with zest and an infectious energy that is hard to dislike i cant really pin point it perhaps its his style or uniqueness or just plain memorable charachtersbut something places him at the front of the herd isnt a perfect film but it is by all means engaging it has an epic feel to it the bride is on a quest for vengenance and at the end of volume 1 she still has a few left on her list it takes a good part of the movie for her to finish off the first assasin like a movie within a movie perhaps the best part about the end of volume 1 is it leaves something to look forward too i cant wait till febuary,cruel
im not entirely sure if the decision to split up into two parts was artistic or financial but whatever the cause the fact that volume 1 is only half the story quickly demolishes any hope for an epic qt asian trashaction film homage instead viewers are left hanging until 2004 and thats not conducive to good cinemawhats here is mostly great uma thurman turns in an inspired performance as an avenging angel of death and the many fights are pleasing and gory as all hell though not quite up to the standard of movies like the hidden fortress or even qts inspiration kage no gundan the soundtrack and visual style ooze cool but one senses qt has lost some of his creative steam somewhere after the gigantic crazy 88 fight  after all theres only so much that can be done with samurai swords give us some guns quentinthe anime sequence explaining oren is beautiful and well done but some of the other gore effects dont work quite as well the problem here is that qt decided to put much of the main fight in black and white for the american release reason is still unknown  perhaps us audiences cant handle gore when gallons of blood are lovingly crafted to splatter onscreen the viewer almost aches to see them in vivid colorthe casting of lucy liu was a huge mistake and the charlies angel still hasnt learned how to act vivica fox is basically tossed aside after the first sequence though hopefully her snappy character will return in the second movie the trademark time shifting works well as do some original camera angle flourishes but its not enough to make a classic overall the first half of the fourth movie by qt ends up being an 810,cruel
quentins newest is a joy to beholdi have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen tarantino has produced a great great movie and his fingerprints are all over iti was sold on this movie as soon as i read the old klingon proverb in the first frame revenge is a dish that is best served cold never has a truer thing been said when in relation to this moviethis is the definately the bloodiest film ever including the blood geysers in the evil dead movies truly i have never seen so much blood on the screen parents are going to have a field day with thisthe comedy is so dark its positively bleak the hospital scene with buck is one of the most shocking scenes i have ever witnessed i mean the dialogue between buck and his customer was the crudest thing i have ever heard from a human beings mouth and the whole vaseline thing killed me let alone billafter seeing this i think qt made the right decision in cutting this movie in half as the movie is so rich it needs to be appreciated in smaller slicesthank you quentin thank you for ,cruel
well maybe its backlash syndrome but i spent most of 1h50 thinking when can i leave although there were a few great moments especially the anime section and the fight with chigusa from battle royale  ie the parts where qt had the least direct involvement i thought it was mostly self indulgent and unengagingthe biggest problem i had was with the dialogue  is this really the same guy that rewrote the book on dialogue in reservoir dogs some of it is just so banal i wanted to throw things at the screen the editing of the film is also suspect  some scenes are interminable and the mild nonlinearity seems contrived and accomplishes little i know were only half way through the story but i still have no idea who the bride or bill really are anyway  the only character in the film that gets any real development is lucy liusi never thought id hear myself saying this but the violence and swearing just seemed gratuitous too i have nothing wrong with enormous quantities of both when used well but here it just didnt seem to serve a purpose or achieve anythingso maybe its just that my expectations or hopes were too high  i guess the film is more interesting than most hollywood efforts and there were some things i liked  it was cool seeing people like sonny chiba and gordon liu up on the big screen the soundtrack was v good the anime section was superbly done and most of the fights were goodill be going to see pt 2 in february anyway and will probably pick it up on dvd but i was hoping for something more,cruel
maybe a few spoilers herinfirst off let me say that i first heard about this movie about a year ago and have been awaiting its arrival ever since  the decision to split the movie into two parts i think was a very good one  i dont think many people could watch three hours of that movie straight through though i could have easily  that being said lets get to the movie this is something that has not been done in the us so many people are not familiar with this type of overthetop violence  however violent as it may be i would not call it senseless violence    everything in the movie was justified  as for the spurting blood from severed heads and arms well that is just part of the style  so if you like violence youll probably love this movie  if you are even a little bit opposed to it then steer clear of this one the acting in this was also very good and it fit with the whole overthetop style of the movie  thurman did a wonderful job as the bride and the supporting actors were all very good there was one bit of anime in the movie that told the story of orens past which also fit very well  one thing that puzzled a lot of people was the fact that the movie went black and white for a scene in particular probably the most violent in the entire movie  if you look at the context youll probably understand why though most people in the theater didnt it ends with a real cliffhanger which will leave you wanting to see more overall 1010everything i had hoped for and more,cruel
for those of you who indulge in the guiltiest of movie pleasures  you know who you are and you know what im talking about  kung fu it doesnt really get much better than  tarentino took things to another plane with this latest project not to mention he added plenty of sounds and techniques reminiscent to the old asian cinema that i love  anyone ever see five fingers of death check it outmichael bbbbbb,cruel
volume 1 is definitely a mustsee movie  quentin tarantino happens to be my favorite writerdirector and im proud to say that he has once again made a cinematic masterpiece  this film is breathtakingactually made me jump twice and im the type that doesnt jump that easily  i cannot wait for volume 2 to come outill definitely be one of the first in a line that will probably be huge the violence in is so stylishand there is a lot of it theres also some comedy and the acting is just marvelousuma thurman for best actressfor best picture cinematography original screenplayand qt for best directorgo see it today1010,cruel
the biggest difference is that this movie is all about fun its about setting up antici and this is before each action sequence a la a spaghetti western where the 3 guys are standing around facing each other down and the tension is so thick and cool you can almost touch it pationthe movies just filled with moments where you are just giddy waiting to see how the action is going to come out by putting a twist on your expectations in every scene of the movie he sets you up so that you just dont know what hes gonna doplus seeing an edged weapon chopping off limbs like its supposed to is pretty nice toogreat great movie,cruel
talk about making a movie for yourself  i am so glad that tarantino decided to share this with all of us  i went in with great expectations and had them surpassed as if they were standing still  i have always been a fan of tarantinos and i am more pleased with this film than i was on opening day of pulp and that is saying a lot,cruel
i never usually comment on films on this site but this is by far the best movie ive seen in years and one of the greatest and most entertaining films i have ever seen i cant even imagine what vol 2 holds in store i might not see another film until it comes out except to see vol 1 repeated times tarantino is a true artist beautiful every moment of it,cruel
from the opening scene of the movie it grabs you and never lets go from the actors to the soundtrack to the cinematography probably the best movie i have seen this year it has that very tarantino cocktail of beauty violence funk wit and sophistication that makes an intoxicating ride the audience at the theatre roared with applause at the endi dont see that often volume 2 is much anticipated go see it right now 10 times 1010,cruel
as this film opens we read in the credits that this is quentin tarantinos fourth film and he again shows us an updated version on a certain genre of film that he grew up on and obviously loves film starts with the bride uma thurman already beaten to a bloody mess and talking to bill david carradine who shoots her in the head she somehow survives and lies comatose in a hospital bed she was pregnant before her attempted murder but when she awakens her baby is gone bill finds out that she is still alive and instead of killing her while she lies in a hospital bed he admires her toughness and orders his hired assassins not to finish her the bride sneaks out of the hospital and upon regaining her strength she makes out a death list for her revenge the list has bill and the four assassins who shot and beat her the four assassins are vernita green vivica a fox oren ishi lucy liu elle driver daryl hannah and budd michael madsen she first goes to vernitas and is involved in a knife fight after she dispatches of her the bride gets on a plane to okinawa japan and tracks down a master sword maker named hattori hanzo sonny chiba hanzo allows her to stay for a month while he makes her a special sword then the bride heads to tokyo and finds ishi who has become a crime boss in that city and surrounds herself with several henchmen and women who all have a special fighting talent the bride follows ishi into a nightclub where a very violent standoff takes placethe bride finishes off ishi but keeps her lawyer sofie fatale julie dreyfus alive so that she can send a message to bill the film ends with bill talking to sofie and asking a very revealing question that sets up a very interesting second part tarantino has always shown so much enthusiasm in his films and there is an abundant of energy in each scene while the story for pulp fiction was more complicated this is not its strictly a revenge film and all the ingredients from the samurai action films of the 1970s are here they were all basically revenge films then and its why tarantino choose the plot while the story is relatively simple there still is a lot going on around it to make it a fascinating film to view and one of the things that jumps out is the music tarantino uses several bits of music from television and other films like the themes from tv shows the green hornet and ironside and the film white lightning thurman wears a yellow outfit while she rides a motorcycle and its exactly like the one bruce lee wore in game of death i dont think this is tarantinos best film by a long shot but it is his most impressive looking it doesnt have the grit like reservoir dogs and its not groundbreaking in the way it tells its story like pulp fiction but visually its a cinematic spectacle thurman shows what a strong and versatile actress she is she seems comfortable in both starring and supporting roles here shes not only the star but its her most physically challenging role to date shes up to the task and her tall physique adds to her performance all the little things that tarantino throws in like the music and the unique casting and the locations make this a fun film to view this is extremely bloody and limbs and heads are chopped off in record numbers so the squeamish may want to steer clear but for tarantino fans and those who are familiar with the samurai films that this is an homage to than your in for quite an experience,cruel
tarantinos 4th film is a true masterpiece innovating in a brand new genre i have never seen anything else like it  this movie is perfect on every level  the violence is really what comes out of this movie  it just wont stop  there is blood all over the place and it adds to the action sequences i left the theater wanting more of and i can hardly wait for volume 2  go see itsavro,cruel
for those of you who do not get the reference samurai jack is a cartoon whose creator developed it in response to the lousy action cartoons he suffered through in his childhood  you know the shows where the characters sit around half the time and only have a small battle at the end  well jack is nothing but action and the same can be said for billthe plot here is thinner than the paper its written on but it just doesnt matter  in fact thats the point  why try to constrain all of the great action with something as useless as a plot  just give uma a list of people she needs to kill and let her do it in the goriest way possible  all action films should be so simple  so often the plot just gets in the way and big showdowns for example seem ridiculous and forced instead of tense and dramatic  this movie was made for the sake of big showdowns and it delivers  its refreshing to have a movie dish out what it advertisesin fact theres so much action and violence im surprised they were able to get an r rating not that im complaining  personally i think these people need to lighten up more often  i guess the blood spray was so exaggerated that they decided it was more humorous than traumatic  but the body count seemed better suited for a video game or antietambut i digress  if you want to see action for the sake of action heres your movie  if the sight of blood makes you sick bring a barf bag  as for me i give it two thumbs up,cruel
even if this might paint me as a sick animaltorturing fiend i must admit that the violence contained in vol one brought a strange and twisted smile to my face and why not in the graphic callousness that has become director quentin tarantinos trademark surpasses anything i have ever seen on the scale of bloodshed but what makes it forgivable is how the whole thing is set up with the brilliant use of color and also of camera styles that just makes the whole thing so slick the plot thus far is pretty shaky but i imagine that it will be tied up nicely in part two a definite dont miss unless you dont care for violence and then you are probably better off sitting at home knitting,cruel
the mainstream audience that likes the film will say that tarantino is a genius and the saviour of cinema as he shows us something that has never been seen before and makes it entertainingthe cynical audience that hates the film will say that he is a hack  didja see reservoir dogs  that was so ripped off from ringo lams city on fire there is nothing original in his films at alli say who really cares  vol 1 is thoroughly entertaining filled with tons of action blood guts and humour  fans of battle royale will especially appreciate the appearance of churiaki kuriyama who plays a very deadly assassin that uses exotic weaponry  bring on volume 2,cruel
greetings again from the darkness  tarantino has done it again  the creator of the incomparable pulp fiction has given us a gift of unique creativity on the big screen  in part this is a tribute of the old chopsockey movies but is is soooooooo much more  casting uma thurman who would have thought as the kung fu expert assasin is pure genius  her fight scenes are remarkable  the touches of qt humor throughout are quite the contrast to the ongoing bloodbaths and severed limbs  his use of black  white and cuts make the violence tolerable and some of the shots are pure magic  the flashback scenes provide most of the story line for us and the death list 5 are all given glimpses while a couple are featured in this most entertaining part one  we have come to depend upon tarantino to deliver something new to us  this is tremendous pressure yet he continues to deliver  his long list of outlandish characters is added to with lucy lius bodyguard gogo  she is right up there with samuel l jackson from pulp fiction  i must advise all to pay special attention to qts use of music throughout  the opening credits are remarkable with the haunting voice of nancy sinatra but hold on for the musical roller coaster after that  count me in for part 2 in february  and at least one more viewing of part one before then,cruel
this film can only be described as a 110 minute entertainment extravaganza it is incredible it is sick it might disturb you it also manages to be funny at the same time the dialogue is amazing the camera work is better than anything ive witnessed the story is good everything is good at the moment i would say it is the best movie i have ever seen,cruel
i was blown away by this movie it was the most entertaining and exciting film i have seen this whole year possibly in the last five years as always mr tarentino is at the top of his game it has a captivating story and a great soundtrack it flows smoothly from start to finish and leaves you wanting more i cant pick a sequence i liked best but i would like to mention that it seemed like a living anime the effects and martial arts were amazing my only complaint goes to miramax and not the film i think that the whole film should have been released all at once no matter how long it ran it seems to me like someone may be looking for more dough thats my opinion great job mr tarentino my hat is off to you,cruel
a very shallow story compared to tarantino standards although it could be possible that the story really picks up in volume 2 so far from what i saw the story is what it is with no twists expect at one point turns or serious story development 4 assassins were sent by bill to kill the bride and now she wants revengehowever that aside this movie is one of the best movies of 2003 so far the directing is superb as always by tarantino the cinematography is jawdropping the same can be said for the stunts and visual effects the score is fantastic and the acting is top notcha note about the stunts and visual effects since very minimal cgi was used and i mean minimal it made the movie even better directors and producers should take a page out of this movie and cut down on the use of visual effects because it can seriously kill the appeal of a movie such as the matrix reloaded did if you go back to movies in the early 90s when cgi was just coming of age it made those movies appealing and even better then present day cgi overloaded movies because it was amazing to see what was done without the use of cgi and you start thinking how did they do that examples terminator 2 judgment day total recall batman back to the future part 2 etcif youre a definite fan of the genre of old hong kong and japanese action movies go see this asap if you love sword fights watch this now if youre a tarantino fan what the heck are you waiting for if you want to watch something different for once in the action movie genre this is itfinal rating 910oh btw this movie definitely deserves its r rating,cruel
anyone who goes to a qt movie and doesnt realize going in that it is going to heavily stylized hasnt been paying attention  if you dont like stylized arty movies then go watch a simple predictable movie like gladiator with its shopworn storyline and pretend you saw a masterpieceall of qts works remind me of my 13 yearold daughters workie twice as much time is spent artsying it up as was spent in doing the regular work but that is okay as long as the necessary parts and work are there and is right and solidthis movie comes together and is the story is quite trackable unlike parts of pulp fiction  you can question the lawn sprinkler effects when heads arms or legs go flying off  but everything falls into place and the set up for vol is quite clear,cruel
once again quentin tarantino brings us a well thought out high imaginative masterpiece of cinematic art violence mayhem gore comedy and storyin a pulp fiction like fashion the movie seamlessly and violently moves from the past to the present and back to the past  the movie uses cinematic techniques and elements from the classic black and white samurai movies the spaghetti western and japanese anime to tell a colorful story not just because of all the blood and gore  but it would be remiss on my part not to mention that theres plenty of it  some comic  some not so comic of a woman uma thurman betrayed by her associates and mentor who is out for revenge  all of the characters are cold blooded killers with little or no remorse about what they do and how they do it while applying a very warped sense of east asian samurailike honor to it all  in truth we dont even know much about uma thurmans character and while she is portrayed as the heroine in this film she may be for all we know the worst of the entire bunch she does appear to be completely encased by her needdesire for vengeance and is following her path with a passion and cold logic that if you take a moment to think about should make this character that much more suspect as a true good heroinecould people that seem to be truly this evil really be considered honorable in some strange way maybe they can but these are not good people  they may say there is no honor among thievescriminals but maybe in some strange sort of way at least for this small group there does seem to be just thatwe dont find out a whole lot about bill except that hes the one that wanted to have umas character dead and buried which if it had worked would have made this a very short movie  bill appears to be some kind of evil mastermind with students and protges littered all over the globe who had been trained in the martial art of the samurai long ago by a sword master and makerthe movie is a very comfortable hour and a half figure up to two hours depending upon how many previews your theatre runs and doesnt leave you hanging as far as the story goes  the ending is dark and very good and neat making the movie by itself a complete item  it doesnt leave you with the lack of wrap up one feels when watching the matrix reloaded or any of the new lord of the rings movies they made me feel like  what thats it its over  and allows you to excitedly look forward to the coming sequel because you truly feel as though this volume is truly complete,cruel
wowvolume 1 is another film im adding to the top of my best films of 2003 listthe new story is actually quite simple uma thurman plays an elite killer  nicknamed black mamba and a member of the deadly viper assassination squad divas  who has been in a coma for four years when she awakes she realizes she was betrayed by the divas who left her for dead in a pool of blood at her own wedding the 4 years later she emerges from a coma and swears revenge on her former master and his deadly squad of international assassinssupremely demented and grotesquely gorgeous  vol 1 is a movie that will separate the true cinema lovers from  well just about everyone who has another set of valuesquentin tarantino has done it again after 6 years mr tarantino delievers the film that fans of his films have been waiting to seewatching you realize that no one combines tension and release violence and humor dialogue and action and music and pictures the way he doestarantino pulls out all the stops not only with his odd assortment of characters but with the use of split screen slow motion and every other special effect he can findis all about the action remember how ridiculously lame the big fight scene between neo and the thousand agent smiths in the matrix reloaded looked you wont get any of that here theres no cg and that makes the fight scenes so much more satisfyinguma thurman gives one hell of a tour de force perfomance she is both fragile and delicate then in the next moment she is lets it all go if the gods smile upon uma she could be looking at her 2nd oscar nod next yearand volume 2 i cant wait,cruel
i  was thinking that this might supplant my favorite movie pulp fictioni was going to be disappointed if this wasnt the best movie id ever seen it was great  however it is not for everyone  i think if you like pulp fiction you will like this movie  its far more violent  but in the same way that tarentino captured cool in pulp he did again here and more so the satire was brilliant the homage was brilliant  all the little touches were amazing from camera shots to anime to the japanese surf rock band,cruel
volume 1 of uses many different styles  and in the end this might be what turns many people off  i feel that most people could identify with qts first 3 films  they follow storylines that are common to american cinema is a total different animal though semispoiler i dont know if the average moviegoer can deal with japanamation in a live action movie i dont think the average moviegoer has seen more than 1 or 2 martial arts films will the average moviegoer be able to deal with hacked off limbs left and rightwill they be able to relate to this film i hope so but realistically i dont think so and thats fine with me because i get this movie i see what qts doing and i love it 8 out of 10,cruel
im going to keep this short and sweetanybody who has seen reservoir dogs pulp fiction and jackie brown know what kind of director tarantino is  he is so unique  is exactly what i thought it would bebrilliant  the music the dialogue the performances all define him as a director  uma thurman steals the show obviously  let me get to the point  see this movie  you owe yourself that  even if you hate it you will never see anything like it,cruel
yuen wo ping should get half the directing credit for this movie because half the film is his remarkable choreographed fight scenes  this is a stylish slick wonderfully artistically violent film  uma thurman is not only amazing but believable  tarantino is very much aware of the importance of music and just like in his previous films i think he did in outstanding job in choosing each musical number for each scene  basic synopsis uma thurman wants revenge on a former employer and her former coworkers who shot her up during at her wedding  she spends the rest of that movie planning and exacting that revengeas i said before there are some amazing fight scenes in this film in particular with a young 17 year old but deadly japanese school girl with a ball and chain  this is tarantinos homage to the violent asian action films of the 70s   pretty much everyone knows that quentin is a big movie buff and freak and his whole career in film making has been paying homage to the films he loved while growing up  this guy sees the beauty of the uberviolent smashed nose low budget films such as cleopatra jones game of death fist of fury the killing machine japanese its  shinkansen daibakuha  in fact if you ever get to see the killing machine you will understand much about the violence in  anyway the fight scenes in this film are nothing short from brilliant  my biggest detraction of this movie is that the way it ends  it felt very much so that it ended in the middle  i know volume 2 will be released in february and i understand some aspect of splitting this film in half but that is the problem  most films that have sequels attached to them are films that have a definite ending themselves  but they were made with and ending  volume 1 of was original made to be a single picture and thus the ending for the movie is actually in volume 2  what we have here is a film that ends on its crest  we only get half the plot we only get half the character development what little tarantino usually have in his films  what we get is half a movie    i am sure that tarantino has a final cut clause in his contract and thus ended up with a 4 probably 4  hour film  and i am sure he as willing to release it as such but miramax came up with the not so brilliant idea of releasing the film in 2 parts  i guess in a hope of doubling its profits i know theater chains hate 3  hours films  they would rather have 8 showings of a 2 hour film instead of 5 showings of films such as braveheart or gladiator  they make more money during the day by faster turnover rates so they will not support a 4 hour film  3  hours is as a far as they are willing to go heck they barely support 3 hour films now when a director wants to tell a story and it takes 4 hours to tell the only way we get the whole story is through directors cut dvds for example the lord of the rings trilogy 1st two parts added an additional 30 minutes each it was the same way with camerons aliens   there is only one postive light in this whole 2 part nonsense and that is that part 2 is being released in february and not a year later as in lord of the rings  will they release the film on one single dvd  i doubt it where is the profit in that  anyway i give an a  i liked it and quentin tarantino along with fight choreographers yuen wo ping and sonny chiba not only delivers a highly entertaining film but a highly memorable one to boot,cruel
it seems to me that many of the people who take issue with this film expected it to be another pulp fiction  this is rather foolish  tarantino will never make a film better than pulp fiction simply because we have idolized it so much over the past decade  it is already a classic and deserves to beis just bloody in all senses of the word good fun  once again tarantino manages to take all the cliches from every genre and combine them to make something fresh and new  no other director today seems to be able to do this as well as he  my only complaints are 1  damn you harvey weinstein for cutting it in half  albeit they did manage to end it well and keep the pacing  secondly i wish they had gone one way or the other with the crouching tigerness of the fight scenes  there are brief moments where characters appear to fly or make incredible leaps but then the rest will come back to earth  its unclear  certainly dont let that stop you from seeing it  in an age where sequels and prequels and remakes are dominating the industry costing millions of dollars and being hyped into deification only to let us down finds its target  bloody good fun indeed,cruel
i dont normally read reviews for films because they are very biased  but being as i am a huge tarantino fan i read a couple for and knew what to expect when seeing itnow that i have seen i loved it  this film was shocking disturbing bloody and very action packed  every actor in this film did a wonderful job  i am waiting impatiently for february to see the second volume  this is a must see especially if you are a fan of martial arts  while there was some wire worked used it was used in a way that wasnt over the top810 stars,cruel
excellent this first part is just excellent tarantinosan just made exactly what he wanted and give us a movie really exciting with a lot of incredible fights a lot of blood and of course a dark humor totally insane and funny uma thurman is amazing the fight with the 80 bodyguards is visually fantasticand the music by the rza is a masterpiece quentin tarantino is still alive alleluyah,cruel
the long awaited 5th quentin tarantino movie will impress those fascinated with tarintinos artistic style and quirky surprisesoutofthegate violence will leave serious fans pleased and even those unfamiliar with this style of movie will find much of the gratuitous bloodshed has been done to amusefans of anime will applaud tarantinos efforts to include an incredible dramatic and action packed animated sequence  virgins to anime will be treated to a real piece of art here  this is your chance to go rent akira ninja scroll or spirited away for the family manmany will be offended but this is a tarantino movie  take note  if you couldnt handle the bruce willis  ving rhames scene in pulp fiction this isnt the movie for youthis is vol 1 do not expect business to be finished by the end of the film810,cruel
what a masterpiece  i was lucky enough to see a screening on tuesday night here in dallas  simply amazing  i cant say enough good things about this film the direction is amazing the plot is more than adequate the acting is topnotch and the photography and style is stunningim not even going to bother to go into details  if you like kungfu camp gore tarantino thurman asian chicks in school uniforms kicking ass or a damn good time see this movie  immediately  do not pass go do not collect 200,cruel
i wasnt sure what to expect from the fourth film by quentin tarantino although arguably his involvement as a writer and producer exceeds this immensely not because i doubted what he is capable of but mainly because the critics have hyped this film up so much and yet there was nothing to really suggest whether the film would live up to it from what i have read and seen of it it did look like it would be some kind of a mindless action film and not much else when leicester square offered an early showing in the uk of this film i jumped at the chance to see it to find out once and for all and the good news is i wasnt disappointedfrom the second the film starts you can instantly tell this is a true tarantino film simply on his trademark way of shooting which takes no prisoners to anyone that might have walked out on this film i have to ask did you really think you could summon the devil and make him behave no thankfully anyone who was worried that qt might have compromised the violence aspect of the film can put their minds to rest not only is ultraviolence a key aspect of the film but the constant psychological suffering of the bride herself and the physical suffering of any of her victims wont go unnoticed you really do feel an empathy for the bride and even when you think shes gone too far she still holds true to her morals drawing the line between those that have done anything to her or about to and those who cantnext aspect to tackle is the common quentin mould that people have been worried about which is the lack of dialogue its true speech doesnt play a key role in this film but what i love about it so much is that the film doesnt play in any chronological order and because of that the story makes more sense as it goes along  the characters dont recap on anything thats happened because they already know so youre left to do a lot guess work rather than having it spoonfed to you any dialogue which is in the film doesnt go to waste for example when the bride has a running commentary will explain what you need to know there is still a fantastic element of comedy still in the film which does provide just the right amount of comic relief when its needed most at the most unexpected of places theres still a lot of room for more dialogue in volume 2 of the film so for this half you should just sit back and watch the blood flowthe film is split into five chapters for the first volume which as i mentioned arent totally in order however it really does make the film more enjoyable to watch that way each chapter has their own tale a la pulp fiction and linked to each other in their ways  one of which the origin of oren ishi is done totally in anime manga to most  which was actually animated in tokyo and like the most of the film is of extreme violence but with the added power that the film is allowed to go that little bit further going to number 11 on the violence level just when you thought you had seen enough its a really excellent touch to the film and just proves that qt is more than willing to spread his horizons more than just being known for doing the same thinganyone who has accused this of taking the piss out of kungfu movies will be eating their words very soon in actual fact its more of a samurai film which is more appropriate as a lot of the film takes place in japan and not hongkong but anything from the directing for the kungfuesque scenes in tokyo the men with the silly masks to the yellow and black suite worn by bruice lee on his last film should only be seen as a tribute to other great films out there and when the lights go out and they fight in silhouette you will only be thankfulall in all volume 1 defeated my expectations its great to see tarantino back in true form and i can only say that uma thurman is probably the hardest female character shattering the likes of linda hamilton in terminator 2 and angelina jolie in tomb raider on all grounds as well as being a fantastic actress all the way through the cliffhanger at the end will have you holding your breath until volume 2 comes out in february i can hardly wait 810,cruel
its crazy but impressive its tarantino i enjoy the projection its interesting  the part in manga animation was quite perfect and action scenes were not far from it u have to see it for yourself i probably die by impatience before volume 2 comes and i tell u something i began to love samurai swords cause they can sing ,cruel
saw this last night and my god its goodthe matrix reloaded looks very sad and limp by comparison the scene where the bride fights all the crazy 88s shows the wachowskis how badly they fluffed the neo v 100 agent smiths scene even the anime flashback in knocks the animatrix out on its arse all i can say is see it you will love it and andy and larry be very afraid qt is really showing you up a treat,cruel
ive learned more about the story from the trailer apparently the decision to split into two films happened after the completion of the trailervol 1 works perfectly for me the brilliant excess comes to a close with a neat twist and blunt anticipation for the finalethe bride aka black mamba uma thurman narrates the film we dont know why or who she is marrying in a church shack in texas all we know is that she gets a gun to the head and tells bill voice of david carradine that the baby is his now after four years in a coma she awakens and seeks revengethe bride was a member of bills deadly viper assassination squad the other members are vernita green aka copperhead vivica a fox now a housewife and mother oren ishii lucy liu the chinesejapaneseamerican boss of the tokyo yakuza oneeyed elle drivercalifornia mountain snake daryl hannah and buddsidewinder michael madsenin vol 1 the bride goes after exvipers vernita green and oren ishii elle driver and budd will along with bill suffer the penalties of payback in vol 2 they will be waiting for herlike our first backofthehead images of the memorable marcellus ving rhames in pulp fiction we only see bills hands clutching a walking stick we only hear his pimp talkwill bill pimp talk buddwith we enter tarantinos world and it is meticulously handcrafted this film is so finely tuned and lovingly made that there is not a fabric fold that does not have his vermeer touch every image is gorgeously framed and a statement of fact this is all about loving filmmaking and loving every charactereach character is given the decorous attention that the bride gets there are no minor characters or supporting players to make the star look good every character can command a fascinating storyline what is on display is tarantinos extravagant admiration for a particular genre  asian action grindhouse bmovies  and lavishing it with talent and slavish devotionwhat we felt about pulp fiction tarantino has eclipsed if you dont like blood splattering be advised to stay home tarantino approaches the blood letting in a novel way its the garden hose on high blast of blood it gives the blood flow a surreal appearance and moves it into cartoon violence the mutilation is another thing altogether a strong ruthless woman hacking off limps and announcing the body parts belong to her any need here for freudall the women are seething with anger it is female cruelty as art formthe women in embody my favorite hindu goddess  who graces my desk  kali the destroyerat the center of tarantinos world is the vicious coldhearted bride well at least she has a good reason to be resentful tarantino has fashioned a female warrior with a primordial purpose sprung directly from the reptilian or rcomplex brain revenge she is a zealot walking straight into the lions den without one moment of fear or apprehension there is no doubt in the brides mind she is also noble when she kills vernita green the bride tells her young daughter that when she grows up and wants revenge she will be waiting its the assassins code of honorah lucy liu after her role in payback she has entered the sex icon domain is there a director who does not want to use her after that stunning turn as a dominatrix tarantino surrounds the bride with females who are just as lethal exotic and even more exciting oren ishii is flanked by two mesmerizing characters her lawyer sophie fatale julie dreyfus and a teenage bodyguard i adored the teenager yeah i loved vincent vega but now i want an entire movie about this kidthe production is gorgeous the anime episode is wonderful the opening scene between vernita green and the bride jumpstarts the movie fox is mean fox is mad and sweating with fury her nostrils throb tarantino famously resurrects daryl hannahs career and liberates her from really bad movie hell shes older harder and tougher than uma she is the perfect foil with a flair for clever eye patches then comes liu with a face that when still expresses coldness and emotionless resolve she scared metarantino has created monumental female characters and delivers the goods as promised,cruel
the bride was once part of a group of female assassins till she changed her life took a new name and pregnant decided to get married but not succeeded since her former boss bill with her former companions arrived and killed everybody at the ceremony and apparently her as wellas a matter of fact she was not dead and she decided to make her revenge to kill all those who tried to kill her and succeeded in killing all the people at the ceremony and the child she was waiting for as welli liked very much it follows the attempts and adventures of women warriors who fight and hate each other like in old epic stories people fight for principles despite concrete restrictions or unlikeliness as a matter of fact tarantino does not describe his characters with many details they are mainly characters not people meat and bonesand that is what makes the movie so fascinating throws you in the universe of ideals of old riders stories even the description of characters cottonmouth for example of their past life is addressed to showing the reason of her ideas of her personal morality but not of her emotions or sensations as human being the use of cartoons helps in this sensei wait for the second part,cruel

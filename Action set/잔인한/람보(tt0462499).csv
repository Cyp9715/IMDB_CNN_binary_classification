i saw this at an advance screening in oslo and going in i didnt expect it to be any more than a cheesy and somewhat gory tribute to eighties actioners by a stardirectorproducerwriter who was desperate to relive past glory that latter may or may not be true but my former assessment was plain wrong this movie is authentic shocking and unlike any other comparable moviegiven its genre the movie is a masterpiece the story is simple but solid and works on several levels the action scenes are unparalleled more intense than black hawk down saving private ryan and stalingrad put together the level of brutality and gore will shock and fascinate and no doubt cause some level of controversystallone proves himself to be an excellent director as well as in excellent shape for his age i had little faith in him going in and i stand correctedthis is a who has come to terms with who and what he is in a movie that holds up when compared with the original first blood well done sly well done indeed,cruel
first of all let me start by saying john is a masterpiece they dont make them like this anymore it is a return of the classic action movie of the 80s and 90s but with a touch of modern directing some will say it is gory some will says it has no plot but lets be honest nobody wants a dramatic twist or a deeper meaning when they go to see and even if you want to you can still find it in traces john is a killing machine but he is also a guy with strong moral values so if you are really looking for a message it is there to be seen other than that it is a full blooded action movie that will strap you to your seat for whole 95 minutes,cruel
is without question a sick action movie and stallone has proved himself again as an intense actor and as a solid director this installment combines elements from all three previous movies but this one had a much more realistic feel yes some dialog is questionable and there are a few albeit brief scenes that dont quite work but make no mistake this movie takes no prisoners stallone slips back into the role with ease and his supporting players do an admirable job critics will whine as they always do about the excessive violence gore and lack of story stick to giving awful movies like the skeleton key thumbs up guys the ironic thing is that actually gives a vivid and some would say accurate portrayal of war it has a similar feel to black hawk down and borrows its chaotic action pulls no punchesits brutality violence and gore are rooted in reality gone is the fun action of 2 and 3 it is replaced with realism which amounts to some of the best and most intense action sequences ive ever seen my only real gripe with the film was scenes that were sped up in post no big deal finally the integrity of the series as a whole has been kept in tact everything from the music to the action to the character to the final scene an extremely well crafted movie action fans will not be disappointedand neither will the critics who rave about the princess diaries,cruel
2008 is essential best action film in the action genre my second personal favorite film in the franchise i love this film to death is a fighting machine and i absolutely love the gory action films this is movie is great it is absolutely awesome i love this film to death it is the best film since iii wasnt that successful this movie was it is been nearly a 10 year anniversary since this movie come out here is where the legend of action heroes reloaded and ended well they wouldve raped her fifty times and cut your fg heads off who are you who are any of you my number one favorite action film is first blood part ii this my second favorite action film from sylvester stallone first blood is number 3 favorite action film in the series john is my comic book hero i love the fourth installment of to death i know there is a lot of people who hate this film and prefer iii over this film and think it is not a good movie i disagree it is not your typical action movie because it is way too gory and bloody mine it is i love s mini machete he uses in this movie this is sylvester stallones only movie he wrote and directed by him self the action is gory and bloody that i love it the movie has tons of action and it is realistic performed i love the rescue mission i love that chops a burmese soldiers head off with his machete puts a mine in the forest and kills 20 burmese soldiers is using a browning m2 aircraft machine gun uses the m2 to obliterate the driver and than he kills all the soldiers while he is reloading the machine gun m2  50cal bmg and than he kills the rest of the soldiers those were the kicks ass action sequences you have a lot of fire power in here and i love the rescue mission in here this is a badass kickass filmsylvester stallone portrayed and acted well his famous character and so did graham mctavish as lewis a mercenary matthew marsden as school boy reynaldo gallegos as diaz and julie benz as sarah i like these characters and they did their acting well done sylvester stallone directed this movie and to me it is really powerful realistic well action performed i dont agree with you haters i think this movie is better than commando 1985 schwarzenegger film puts most of action films today to shame thats my personal opinion music score from brian tyler wasnt that terrible like everyone is saying it was arguably good to the character richard crenna and jerry goldsmith couldnt come back because they both past away and are no longer with us anymore rip i think brian tyler did a good score ps i dont like the extended version because it is different from the theatrical cut and looks like an asshole in the beginning of the movie i love theatrical cut and honestly it goes fast around it is not boring it is entertainment it is one of my personal favorite action movies this movie is a perfect 10 for me,cruel
is an 80sstyle action movie with modern sensibilities stallone is not a oneman army as in previous movies but rather a dogged old soldier that comes to terms with what he actually is while racking up a body count that would make tarintino proud in many ways this movie parallels rocky balboa as a mature ending to a series of sometimes overthetop but fun action movies john in this movie is an aging but potent killing machine that for the first time since first blood accomplishes his mission in a very believable manner the action is visceral and downright gory at times surpassing the hardcore scenes of omaha beach in saving private ryan the film pulls no punches when showing exactly what a barret 50 caliber sniper rifle can do to a human body stallone mutters only a very few lines of dialog in this movie theres no speeches or patriotic flag waving going on here but there is a clear lesson on how well liberal idealism holds up under barbaric realities amid genocide and wara must see but not one for the kiddies,cruel
just watch it words dont justify it people didnt believe sly still had it but they were so wrong after the the great performance at rocky balboa i expected another great performance for him but this was even better than i imagined you dont have to be an stallone fan to enjoy this movie if you like action movies this one is for you a word of caution though this isnt for the light hearted there are some serious violence in this movie i am gonna say this is one of the best action movies i have seen in a long time but you dont have to take my word for it just watch it its better than the previous films expcept for about 15 minutes in the middle the whole film is action packed you cant possibly be bored if you hate action movie or if you have something against violence this isnt for you but if you are not than sit back and enjoy the legend that is for one last time,cruel
a straight action film only stallone could deliver nobody else could direct such an uncompromising pursuit of battle the battle sequences of this movie are glorious and violent in a way that is special a new extreme level of tension was achieved in my opinion and i dont say this in blind excitementthis movie delivers a moviehigh that is not often attempted movies usually hold back or simply fail at achieving visceral action and instead try to balance themselves between action plot drama comedy etc and in many cases in modern films this only lowers the quality of the experience the downfall of you could say is its small concern for character drama indeed the scenes looking at the female lead and the mercenary group are pretty poorly acted though this allows the scenes to focus on stallones disregard for their antics it can get annoying to sit throughthe mercenary groups character were so over the top in acting however it came off like farce to me which was actually really entertaining seeing their macho lines fall dead in the air stallone giving them no respectthe battles were glorious even if the film has flaws but it focuses on the battle as it should and achieves glorious cinematic victory great experience,cruel
during his career sylvester stallone gave the audience many great times to remember himfrom rocky and to demolition man and shade stallone was always a true super star as an almost exclusive action films actor he brought to the audience for over three decades high quality action movies however aging is always a problem for such actors and stallone could escape ita little though his physical condition is tremendous lets not forget that he is almost 62 it is a fact that his last films did not manage to reach the quality of his previous successes driven dtox avenging angelo and shade were really good films indeed but their shine was not as big as rocky or that is why stallone returned with his major two success roles rocky balboa was excellent and meaningfull now it is time forjohn this film is simply excellent although it is mostly an action movie it has also deeper meanings such as ethical values and political messages just like rocky balboa john uses the formula of the first movie mixed with this of the forthmonosylabic dialogues from meet the political messages of the activists the violent reaction of towards the brutal soldiers is justified by his ethical code with a deeper meaning that oppresion and injustice generates strong reaction acting as a whole is very good and convincing stallone is really born to be and the supporting cast is made by young actors who meet the quality standards of milo ventimiglia the project budget is 50m so as you understand there are many reallike explosions and effects what is new is the ultra violent death scenes they really look truethe story is interesting although as you expect not complicated to summarize john is one of the best action movies that 2008 will probably bring to usalso it is a must to see because not only it is a really good movie but also because it is the last film stallone even if he is 62 looks no more than 45 and his condition is impressive a must for all action film fans and not only by them is a really good film and you should not miss it,cruel
oh the haustacity yesi will say it again haustastic at his besti dont care he may be old but crap man this movie is awesomestallone definitely took a step towards the mel gibson approach in making it realistic that is what a 50 caliber round does to a man the genocide scenes are rough and graphicdefinitely not for young audiences but for everyone else hausomethe story is solid it doesnt take long at all to get to the action this is a must see for any person looking for some great actionrated r for ridiculous rampaging reoccurring ,cruel
thrilling and moving episode in which he returns to war and to rescue american prisoners  the famous trilogy has been completed by this recent  john  a definitive improvement and directed by the same stallone in which fights enemies in thailand  nevertheless the best considered is the original  violent movie with character who started in first blood and that launched stallone career going on his successful episodes  sylvester stallone as brawny hero is topnotch  he was a previous green beret  now retired and living a pacific existence in thailand  he has retreated to a easy life in a rural thai village next the burmese frontier  capturing snakes for local entertainers and transporting visitors in his old 109 pt boat  but john joins a group of mercenaries graham mctavish matthew mardsen to venture into wartorn burma and rescue a group of christian aid workers julie benzpaul schulze who were abducted by the ruthless local infantry who carries out a brutal massacre  he then frees the prisoners but cruel soldiers sett off in pursuit and leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares  puts dangerous traps in the jungle woods and mountains  appears threatening  lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers from the beginning to the end the comicbook actionpacked and extreme violence is continued and its fast movement  for that reason the picture is pretty amusing  furthermore contains lots of explosions and some of the best action scenes ever made  including an impressive machinegun attack  stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel one army man and excellent julie benz as suffering missionary  in addition the veteran ken howard and including some flashbacks of deceased richard crenna in an enjoyable homage  the outdoors are spectaculars  the landscapes have been filmed on location in arizona usa chiang mai thailand and mexico  awesome and exceptional cinematography by the cameraman glen macpherson  splendid and rousing musical score by brian tyler this nailbiting film is well played  produced and stunningly directed by the great silvester stallone the motion picture is preceded by the original first blood by ted kotcheff with richard crenna  david caruso and brian dennehy in which is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pulls off the breakout  ii by george pan cosmatos with martin kove steven berkoff and julia nickson in which hes forced to go cambodia in search of american pows  and followed by iii with kurtwood smith and spiros focas and of course richard crenna  in which against the russians who control a particular sector of afghanistan and he goes behind russiandominated enemy lines too rescue his former coroner from jail  the film will appeal to action enthusiast and stallone fans  its a movie for adrenaline lovers and frantic thrillers buffs rating  good entertaining but violent  two thumbs up  although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take  this exciting film still has its magnificent moments this largescale and lavishly produced pic attempts a peculiar atmosphere with spectacular results  rating  better than average  well worth seeing ,cruel
is a great action movie and reminds me on how the action movies were made in 80s the plot is developing very fast and the pacing is very good sly is doing all his stunts and doesnt speak much mercenaries were good in my opinion and without them the movie would be to unbelievable and unrealisticdisplays the war like ive never seen it before and believe me ive watched many war movies camera is beautiful music is perfect and fits to the action scenes bryan tylers take on goldsmith home coming theme is in the beginning and in the end of the movies ending is greati have 3 objections 1  the acting of julie benz was too unbelievable to me 2  maybe more drama and less action not necessarily 3 camera work in some places is to shaky for my taste but on the other hand it gives a lot of tension to the actioneverything else is greatmy expectations were high and now i am pleasantly surprised i had my doubts about the movie especially after some negative critic reviews but now all i have to say thank you sly for giving us iv i must say the movie may not be for everyone because of violence but i think every fan and fans of the action movies of the 80s will be happy with this movie my theater was filled i hope it does well at the us boxoffice because sly deserves it i have no doubt that the movie will be success in other parts of the world alsois definitely back,cruel
being a huge sylvester stallone fan i was more than happy just seeing him on screen again and i would usually just be content watching any movie with stallone and thats what i went in expecting but hell was i wrong this had me jumping up from my seat every 2 minutes this had one hell of a message and wasnt just a mindless action movie with gore i loved each bit of the movie and watching stallone act so well was a total pleasure it was also kind of shocking at how stallone is still in physical form considering his age he was very flexible for his age and thats also what helped push the movie further also his ruthlessness in regards to the injustice overall a brilliant 1010 if you ask me,cruel
i was one of the big fan of series all time i have been always loving all series but this one shocked me up lotsyou all may have seen this as an ordinary film for me as a burmese i know this is the true situation in burma and feel so sorry for people who suffering exactly as the same way as mentioned rapes touches murders and breaking all of the human rights by the military governments are clearly film cast i personally would like to thanks to the director for letting the world know the current situation in burma stallone you rock moreover i wish there will be a lot of s in real world out there who will save many lives of innocent burmese people,cruel
in the universe this is the best movie of the lot admittedly were talking about a limited and perversely esoteric universe but hey thats a given going inwhy does this film enjoy this lofty perch its hard to put your finger on it but i say its sylvester stallones relative evolution and maturity as a film maker stallone built into the story and into the character itself some understatement and subtleties not before seen understatement and subtleties were never stallones main calling card preferring instead brooding and vengeful extreme blunt force trauma and make no mistake we get heaping portions of the latter here too but stallone layers a little texture into the plot and into john not much before seen not much before seen rather than never before seen because in truth the first film first blood did contain texture to the story and to the character but it was of a different sort as mentally unstable a victim of an unpopular war besides since that first entry stallone took the franchise and character off in a different directionthe story begins with living somewhat contentedly in semiretirement as a snake hunter and riverboat operator in thailand the innerbrooding and maybe even traces of the innersimmering are still there but he seems to have to some degree come to terms with himself and the world he is approached by a team of american christian missionaries to take them upriver into burma the teams leader michael burnett played by paul schulze earnestly tries to persuade to take them but is having none of it during this early scene some of stallones newly found understatement and subtlety shows itself michael negotiating with to take them uppriver tells about their humanitarian mission while is tending to his caged snakes while tersely telling michael that michael cant make a difference unobtrusively feeds a little white mouse to a snake where the old stallone wouldve highlighted this act focused the camera on it and then made an ostentatious display of the snake devouring the mouse the mature stallone does not the focus is on the conversation and the mouse is in the background and it happens quickly we the viewer are left to ponder what we fleetingly saw and only later realize the conceit of the metaphorrebuffed michael gives up undeterred the only woman in the group the comely sarah played by julie benz picks up where michael left off she pleads with in just about every way possible to take them to burma still says no more than once he tells her to go home after pleading doesnt work sarah resorts to basically stalking in a conversation on the dock in a monsoonlike rain sarah is able pierce through s impenetrably hardened exterior touching him inside maybe youve lost your faith in people but you must still be faithful to something you must still care about something maybe we cant change what is but trying to save a life isnt wasting your life is it she asks him theres something about sarah that reaches unlike anyone else this or any previous and we know at this point that has in some manner bonded with sarah because he finally relentsas an aside i briefly wondered if this wasnt a setup for some sort of love interest for however counterintuitive and implausible given their age differences but at the same time it seemed possible being uncertain about the state of stallones ego nowadays sarah informs that she and michael are engaged and that changed the dynamic but didnt necessarily dispel the notion instead it was sarahs persistence and ability to reach on a purely human level in no way sexual that dispelled it at one point she says to you have family back home father maybe i dont know to which sarah says arent you curious to see how things mightve changed back home that simple exchange left at least contemplative working on the soft inner the of first blood who couldnt find his way home after all hed been throughthe first action scene follows soon when they are overtaken by wellarmed burmese river pirates the pirates quickly focus on sarah with obvious malevolent lascivious intent at crunch time with no way out kicks into action dispatching the numerous pirates with extreme and bloody prejudice in seconds flat at this point we know that hasnt lost any bit of a step since we last saw him we also now see that has bonded with sarah and that hes got her back forever and everultimately drops the group off in burma where theyll go overland to their destination and leave that way too so they bid themselves adieu but we know its not really adieuwhat follows for the next 60 minutes is pretty much your standard issue search and rescue operation style modern special effects galore a veritable bloodfest  the film despite its sensitivities and appeal to the soft side of is perfunctorily taken out of the chickflick genre a little different twist though works with a team of hired mercenaries led by former sas commando lewis played by graham mctavish also of note is former sas sniper extraordinaire schoolboy played by matthew marsden a loyal and efficient operator who has s back shows himself a capable team player and leader in addition to being a oneman doomsday machineat the end we see back in arizona walking up the drive home to his fathers ranch presumably for the first time since he left oh so many years agois this the end of the franchise maybe probably well just have to wait and see im betting it is at rest,cruel
a 60 year old stallone as an exsoldier who can still kick ass is more believable than him as a 60 year old boxerits one of the things that worked about thisahemfilm i felt the same way after watching the last rocky movie as i did after watching this it was good but ultimately pointless you know that the peacecorp types will be wrong and violence will be the only solution and it will result in a major bloodbath seriously the most violent of the series has no surprises that said is enormously entertaining violent as hell and you get what you came for it will definitely satisfy fans of the series though i had a weird feeling when i left the theater did i really just pay to see wow,cruel
rated r for strong graphic bloody violence sexual assaults grisly images and language4or is in my opinion the greatest film in the series and one of the greatest action movies of all timethe film definitely exceeded my expectationsit brings back old memories of 2 and 3but with 10x more violence and gore the storyline is actually pretty good for an action film better than the story lines in 2 and 3 but the action is amazing the film is very very violent and if you have a weak stomach you do not want to watch this film theres blood and decapitation everywhere in this film the acting is good from the entire casteven stallone in my opinion but there were times when you could hardly hear himthe plot of the film involves a bunch of missionaries wanting to go to burmaadvises them not to but they insist and he takes them therea man then comes to him telling him they have not returnedthis is because they were captured by the burmese soldiersstallone does a good job in making us really hate the burmese soldiersthey brutally beattorture and murder people rape women etcthe leader is even a pedophileso now and some mercenaries go to escape with the missionariesthe movie really makes you root for and the mercenaries while they are fighting just like when watching the other filmsif you enjoyed the other films this is definitely a mustif you are an action film fan this is definitely a must there have been a lot of pg13 sequels to rrated franchises such as alienpredatoralien vs predator and die hardlive free or die hard which was still pretty goodis very rrated and very pleasing for fans,cruel
action 10  10 on action it takes a few moments to develop but then the action kicks off and when it does it just builds and builds until the climax theres plenty of blood and gore as sporting his trademark 50 caliber blazes away in fact its one of the few movies to shows how grizzly such an attack would beplot 910 overall i felt that did an excellent job of portraying a world where the typical idealistic foreigners meet the harsh realism of a barbarian world many of us in the comfort of our homes feel like we want to get in and do something about the atrocities we hear of in the news so off we go with our ivory tower attitudes having little idea of the truth and reality behind mans inhumanity to man the exsoldier is portrayed as a perfectly wisened and jaded killing machine who tells the philanthropic party what they dont want to hear  that theyre in way over their heads fighting a fight they cannot win because their approach is so dramatically different as to be not even on the same planesurprises 4  10 here there are no surprises you could write this one yourself but it really doesnt matter its still enjoyableduration 7  10 this is a surprisingly short movie as just shy of an hour and a half i found myself wanting a little more by the time it finished i think we tend to develop this internal chronometer of how long a decent movie should go and this one only went about 34 of the waycharacter development 510 we dont learn much from character interactions reluctant as he is early on seems to acquiesce in what seems to be a moments time there are also the typical showdowns between protagonists antagonists and so on but these are quickly and incompletely developedsynopsis overall i really enjoyed the movie yes it has its shortcomings but i believe its point is important enough for people to see and the action certainly doesnt disappoint i give it an 810 enjoy,cruel
take the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan  with soldiers limbs being shot off at the dday landing at omaha beach add some magnificent jungle scenery and action a la tears of the sun and put it all in  blackhawk down mode with gunfire dominating the filmand you have the latest moviehey i knew it was going to be a tough adventure story but this was a shock ive never seen so many heads blown off limbs blasted away with blood spurting out and holes blasted in the middle of chests and stomachs in one movie in my lifeand its only 81 minutes long the last dozen minutes are ending credits man this is almost nonstop action and suspense yeah a bunch of it is overdone but overall it still was an entertaining moviei know it sounds like some dumb texas chainsaw massacretype thing but it wasnt despite the mayhem there actually was a small story with a decent message about making your life stand for something gets a conscience could be another title to this moviehowever if you are the least bit squeamish about bloody violence you better skip this movie if you enjoy a good action movie and dont care if it gets a little gross in spots this is your cup of teain spades if you have any hostility in you after 80 minutes of watching this it should be gone after an absence of 20 years sylvester stallones john comes back to the screen is the kind of guy you dont want on your college debate team but hes a number one draft choice on the field of battle hes a man of few words and a lot of testosterone with veins popping out of his arms like a 25yearold bodybuilder stallone looks more juiced than barry bonds but at least it makes him look the part even if he does have bags under his eyes i liked stallones comeback in the recent rocky balboa better but this was still an entertaining flickthe middleaged john was more realistic than the male missionary michael burnett who was a bit obnoxious for who he was playing ive met a number of missionaries and none of them act or sound like this guy but thats the film world for you the guy with the australian accent who was the leaders of the mercenary group was a bit overthetop and cartoonlike with the profanity with him and the burmese rebel leader you had no probably identifying who the aholes were in this movie and who were the good guys they werent too subtle about that then again the action scenes werent too subtle either  but it was entertaining in a sick sort of wayone last thing that everyone should agree with this was nicely filmed with fantastic jungle scenery kudos for cinematographer glen macpherson and director stallone for some incredible shots i cannot imagine how good this must look on a highdefinition disc,cruel
on monday oct 25th 1982 i enlisted in the united states army the weekend before my last movie as a civilian was first blood i have to say that movie was a major source of motivation as is being chased up the mountain he says to himself keep moving i repeated that mantra through boot airborne and then qcourseyou could go sf of the street back then i spent the next 25 years serving proudly with the brave men of the 5th sfg at campbellrip matty kimmell a few months ago i separated honorably and made my way to hwood to keep an eye on my actress daughter i refused to see any movies until came out today first film as a civilian it was well worth the wait this is a great closer to an important figure in american pop culture i found the acting and script to be first rate the action was too realistic i had tears in my eyes as the burmy soldier bayonets the young boy and as the team comes across the overrun village with the rotting corpses very realistic the only issues i had were of the merc team multinational teams dont exist and the interesting calibers they carried but hey the spirit remains ending were it was first headed to so many years ago was poetry perhaps my own history shades my view of this top rate movie but isnt that what films are for to show you that no matter what you are things do change,cruel
despite the fact that i grew up with sly films im not a huge fan but no one can deny the characters place as the iconic action hero i admit that when i heard stallone was reviving as well as rocky i was more than skeptical but both films were dutifully faithful to their respective franchises and profess now that i was wrong about stallone  he has garnered my full respect as a quality director and film maker at least within the confines of his own beloved franchisesin the case of stallone pulls no punches no pun intended here we get another glimpse of john as a lost man we also get to see him lay down untold destruction on a group of burmese militia lead by a very sadistic leaderthis is hardly a brainy film but who would ever expect a film to be so what we do expect is something dramatic and intense action and on the surface delivers in spades but the films underlying beauty is its message about the true terrors of burma and like countries of course this film is fictional but stallone did plenty of research even the chief villain maung maung khin is a former freedom fighter in burma and im sure added his own nightmarish accounts of the realities of the situationand let me say this now this film is a blood bath but not in a hollywood sensein a very realistic sense when you watch this movie remember that is happening right now somewhere in the world these scenes are the same that can be found in iraq toonot a huge fan of mindless action nor a violencejunkie i was surprised by how visceral and powerful this film is not for the faint of heart but if youre a fan of oldschool brutal action films dont miss itits also a lean 91 minutes long which is very welcome in todays holloywood bloating of 2 hours films,cruel
i have to say this exceeded any expectations i had for a film this is no sad comeback farce this is the real deal sylvester stallone plays to his strengths using his age and mileage to his advantage as a haunted old bulwark theres no oiledup posturing or sad old manboobs on display the dramas quick and to the point maybe speaks 50 words throughoutgone is the ridiculous action hero of 2 or 3 gunning down hundreds of bad guys alone atop a hill without cover this sticks to stealth and surprise and he has allies that are both memorable and competent which is nice for a changei will also say has the most consistent and realistic gore youve ever seen you could call it overthetop but really i think its just as close to real as youll get limbs get blown off heads get sheared children are killed oncamera its all in your face not as exploitation but simply illustrating what it really means to rain lead upon a human beinglets not kid ourselves this isnt the film to end war and in the end its a kickass action movie it does exhibit some conscience without hitting you over the head with it burma really is one of the prime shames of the human race and im glad to see this movie bring attention to iti feel so happy that stallone could pull of such a great movie he really does care about this character and this movie and it shows if you dont like heap big explodo this aint your flick but if you like action its a cantmiss seriously,cruel
i remember the first time that i saw first blood i thought it was going to be a typical silly action movie but it turned into one of the best action movies i had seen i remember hearing about the sequel which was at the time titled john with rocky balboa i saw rocky and was very disappointed so i was assuming the same was going to be with but after some promising reviews i went ahead and saw it today and this is seriously the best action movie in years i couldnt believe how incredible this movie was it was brutal terrifying but had a great story sylvester stallone still has it and is incredible i cant believe how great he looked and how he still hasnt lost his edge the reason why this movie worked is because i think he really understands john this movie could have never worked without his touchjohn lives in vietnam as a guide of the river he makes a living collecting snakes for a sport for the villagers there is a huge war going on a civil war where the vietnamese are brutally killing villagers if not taking their boys and making them into soldiers and violently raping their women when a peace group who is convinced that they will change everyones ways asks john to bring them into the war they go into more than they expected when they are captured john has to go back into action to save their lives and bring them back home safelyis seriously the best film that i have seen so far in 2008 the only thing that was disturbing to me is that the civil war is not far from the truth at all and how brutal it was but it was nice to have a good guy to root for and have hope that some people can regain their faith in the goodness in people i was thinking today how weird it is this is a genuine action movie the one people have been waiting for years to have and it took the old school to bring back that exciting feeling i highly recommend believe me this is an excellent movie and i cant wait to have it on video sylvester is back and hes better than ever is still awesome and so much fun to watch1010,cruel
first blood and are two of the best action films ever made and even iii is good stallones interpretation of is that of a reluctant hero he really never wanted to be in the situation he was thrust into but once there he cannot deny who that man is and that is none other than a killing machine in the commentary for first blood by stallone himself he admits that is a man that cant help who he is he doesnt start wars or confrontations but he sure as hell excels in the situation this is no different just as rocky told adrian in rocky iv you cant change who you are is no different he wants to live peacefully and for 20 years he might have been but that time has passed burmamyanmar is about to learn thatthe first five minutes establishes the tone of the film and within those first five minutes you will know if this is the film for you or not i hate to sound like everyone else but this is the opening 20 minutes of saving private ryan but for the entire 90 minutes there is enough carnage in here to make even the toughest individual cover their eyes once or twice i remember as a kid i thought it was tough to watch get the knife across his chest in the flashback scene in first blood if that was a scene in here it would be the tame by the standards the movie sets we instantly witness limbs and heads flying everywhere there are humans being fed to pigs still alive women are raped kids and forced to play mine games and when someone gets an arm or a leg chopped off it is as graphic as can be i dont think stallone was aiming for gratuitous violence here but realismwhen you see films like blood diamond hotel rwanda and others of the same ilk it reminds you that there are conflicts taking place in many places in the world and if it doesnt benefit the unite states to get involved if there is no oil to steal or money to be made then no one hears about it we all know about afghanistan and iraq because the us has interest there but no one cares about a bunch of burmese people being slaughtered by a government army stallone makes you care the christain missionaries that arrive at the scene provide the canvas to paint the picture with but with or without them it doesnt change the fact that the realistic violence perpetrated by the thugs in this movie happens read page 22 of any north american paper and youll get a tiny blurb about mass graves indicating some kind of ethnic holocaust makes this front and centeri dont want to give you the impression that this another jfk or platoon because it is not this is simply one of the best action films i have ever seen and stallone shows once again that he is an action aficionado behind the camera im not sure many others could make a film like this the action is tense frenetic and unapologetic although we havent seen a film in 20 years stallone doesnt skip a beat besides the action stallone is also excellent in here as the quiet hero while he wrestles with who he is once he accepts that all hell breaks loose i have always thought stallone was such an under rated actor and in spite of all the myopic critics diatribes about him he can act might not on par with stallone performance in rocky or copland but he hits every note he needs to here he is a man of few words but his actions speak louder than any david mamet  no disrespect to mamet i love his work script couldthere are some very nice touches here as some of the music is straight from jerry goldsmiths vault and there is a nice homage to first blood where it all began when he wears the same jacket as he did when we first see him in the originalis a great action film in fact one of the best in recent memory this is one that all action fans should give a chance i was entertained for every second and there is even a sad message in the film is worth your time sly has done it once again910,cruel
stallone has truly done it again we were treated last year to a much more truthful and humanistic closing to the rocky saga and with this he has also brought full circle  literallythe movies message is a powerful one striking at the heart with the most aspiring of the holy emotions the film depicts accurately the most extreme forms of human barbarity short of cannibalism and does not pull any punches in doing sohowever the true message of the film expands into multiple parts as the storyline progresses including johns own realization of what life means to him  giving him the reason that he has been searching for in his life this ultimately leads to the completion of his own journey it also focuses on the striking difference between those of us in civilized culture and those who have endured or witnessed such cruelty bringing home a truth that at the heart of man is the beast  and we must be ever vigilant in our own culture here at home as to not allow the display of this beast to ever become acceptable through this the films two strongest messages become clear  that violence is necessary to defeat violence and that the blessings we shroud ourselves in here in this country were paid for by the blood of many  a truth that has since been almost forgotten and replaced with naive logic that is only true within the bubble of this nations blessed postwwii lifeour complacency in our beautiful sheltering society has resulted in the belief by both those on the left and right that perhaps violence doesnt solve anything or that everyone can be reached through peaceful means stallone makes a very strong point in this area  which may be why some reviewers are approaching it from an immature perspective  categorizing it as gory and lowbrow entertainment this is naive and simplistic and shows their impatience or inexperience with a message this important yet so well hiddencongratulations sly on another commanding film this is a definite mustsee,cruel
do you want to know how good is well if it had been released in 2007 i would have had it ranked just outside my top 10 it is somewhat embarrassing to admit that  after all the franchise had become a joke after the 1985 and 1988 sequels those two efforts had completely undermined and overshadowed the brilliance of the original first bloodthis latest effort from actor  writer  director sylvester stallone is a guttwisting soulpounding action adventure that will have the squeamish running for the aisles it is so intensely violent that it boggles the mind how stallone managed to avoid an nc17 or an x then again with the mpaas hypocrisy never in doubt i am not that shockedyears after our last encounter with the lonesome warrior we find him living as peaceful a life as possible on the banks of a burmese river john has severed all remaining ties with the outside world choosing to survive with his knife his arrows and his boat that existence is turned upsidedown when a peace group consisting of doctors and missionaries ask for his assistance in getting up river deep the heart of a genocidal burmas initial reaction is to shun the group telling them to go home nothing can be done here his defiance lasts only until sarah julie benz a fairheaded beauty guilttrips him into doing something more with his life she says when youre trying to save a life youre not wasting yours i suppose that if there is a theme underlying all the extreme violence and carnage of this story it is this  that it is better to die fighting for something than to live fighting for nothing when the peace mission goes horribly wrong and a village is massacred and a team of mercenaries are called upon to go in and rescue sarah and her colleagues what ensues is an astonishing sequence of brutality the likes of which has never really been seen in a mainstream release i am pretty good at holding my lunch under any circumstances but pushed my boundaries to the limit there are some scenes which obliterate the senses in every way if you are looking for a visceral cinematic experience make sure to see this film on a massive screen with a crankedup sound system the 19inch sanyo will not do this film justicei loved every single second of this bloody disgusting barrage the scenes were directed superbly keeping the audience fully aware of the unfolding events without any of the typical confusion seen in most action flicks the visuals and the sounds combine to literally move you in your theater seat places you in right next to the explosions right next to the relentlessly rhythmical bassline of gunfire there are no cutaways in this moviewith all that praise heaped on the action scenes it might be easy to overlook the unexpected the acting the dialogue the music the cinematography  each and every aspect of the film is far better than you would typically suspect from this franchisestallone and benz are wonderful in what amounts to an unspoken attraction between two very different people their scenes together are among the strongest moments in the movie stallone manages to do here what he managed with rocky balboa  he returns to the roots of the character creating two finales that rival the originals in both franchises they are both so supremely well done that one can easily forgive the directions they took during the mid to late 1980slisten i went in to this film expecting very little i hoped for some action some brooding vietnam resentment and some of that familiar theme music i got everything i asked for and a whole lot more without giving anything away there is a moment late in the film when stands atop a hill staring down at sarah  that moment got to me the way i never expected possible from this character it is a very lonely moment i felt for the guy but i wasnt crying that was just popcorn seasoning that got in my eye i swear tc candler independentcriticscom,cruel
am amazed by the yee ha themes which are constantly coming across in the reviewscomments on this film to be frank its gun and knife and mine and bow and arrow and flamethrower porn all the way now thats fine but attempting to dress it up as deep and meaningful is hugely disingenuous in my opinion the whole burma message and the massive over inflating of just how mean and nasty the villains really are combine solely to give some sort of justification for the incessant violencethis is an action flick plain and simple with sfx taken to a new level of realism over a prolonged period look at the stats on imdb as to which demographics are giving the biggest thumbs up  male under 18 and male 1829  says it all really to me its not hugely different from the hostel type films which coincidentally enjoy the same type of reviews from the very same demographics on this and other sitesits a tough watch but a good action movie if thats your bag it is not a deep and meaningful film in any way shape or form despite what you may read on here if you want a war andor genocide based film with genuine meaning and poignancy go and watch the killing fields hotel rwanda welcome to sarajevo black hawk down or even private ryan if you want good old fashion kickass guns explosions and blood alongside sly reprising the of 23 rather than first blood then this is your film just dont dress it up as a movie with a message stallone could have made a much more effective film about the plight of burma had he wished to its just that it wouldnt have fitted with the franchise sly is widely quoted as saying he was struggling with whether to make a documentary or a movie looks like the studio helped him overcome that struggle and judging by the comments on here it was financially at least the right thing to do,cruel
you can see a major problem the producers of the franchise have  3 was made in 1988 and since then the world has changed beyond recognition  communism has collapsed  all the countries in south america are democracies as is much of asia  saddam was overthrown in iraq by the coalition as was the taliban in afghanistan whilst ghaddfi was friendly to the west before he was overthrown and lebanon has been at peace for many years  that doesnt leave too many bad people for john to exterminate and thats a problem  perhaps the producers could have done a story set in columbia where a bunch of narco terrorists have captured some cia types while the subtext of  just say no  is bludgeoned in to the audience  for some reason the producers never thought of this and decided to set the movie in a real world context the mistake the film makes is obvious in the opening scene where were shown graphic newsreel of atrocities committed by state forces in myanmar aka burma  are these atrocities real  certainly  is the violence one sided  well thats the problem  being very much a closed state the conflict in burma isnt something i have a great deal of knowledge of and just because it isnt reported doesnt mean its not happening  stop to consider the reportage in the middle east  israel builds jewish settlements on the west bank thereby breaking international law which is a leading headline on world news while the syrian regime of assad drops cluster bombs on a town killing a dozen civilians and its a very brief news item  length of item and number of features on the news doesnt equate the real tragedy of a situation  i actually had to consult the wikipedia to find out about the conflict in burma  a country that is in fact finding tourism a growing industry  nevertheless it seems wrong that a political situation like this is used for an excuse of exploitation cinema and make no mistake is exploitation at its most graphic and brutal  not only is it the most violent of the movies in the franchise its also one of the most brutally graphic films a major studio has released  its not enough to see someone die from a bullet wound director sylvester stallone must show someones head exploding in to a million pieces  when someone gets blown up they must literally get torn limb from limb  this extends to the characters  is it enough to show burmese soldiers murdering innocent civilians  of course not  theyre shown as gang rapists and being the officer in charge being a rapist is not enough he must be shown as a paedophile  even the mercenary antiheroes are a combination of black and white with the older mouthy brit only interested in self preservation and money juxtaposed by the younger idealistic brave brit to call them cyphers would be too much of a compliment this hurts the film greatly because the action scenes work very well  if it was 87 minutes of totally blood thirsty mindless fun which is what the film is  however you always aware of the fact youre watching a movie set in a real country and youre also aware its trying to preach a messege that the military regime of burma is not very nice  ive no doubt that isnt very nice but its the same for a few places on earth  do the ksshmiris like being occupied by india  do the tibetans like being occupied by china  no they dont as ive seen in my travels across the world  but should at best be viewed for what it really is  entertaining rubbish and not a fly on the wall documentary featuring areal life political on going conflict,cruel
i had the chance to see last night and it was a hell of a lot of fun hell being the operative world this movie is not for the faint at heart its a great guys action flick that perfectly captures the 80s action movie feel but be warned its gorier than a freddyjasonleatherface movie what i found interesting on a psychological level was that before the movie started a lot of people in the audience were excited about how gory it was going to be the marketing campaign depicted people getting beheaded by s knife and liquefied by a tankbuster gatling gun  the first few shots of the movie however show actual footage of the horrors going on in burma right now it was some seriously revolting stuff rotting corpses smashed in skulls and butchered children a lot of people turned away in disgust myself included i couldnt help but remember russell crowe in gladiator after dispatching a few opponents in gory fashion screaming into the previously rabid but now silent and horrified audience are you not entertained interesting statement by stallone regarding the audiences bloodlust id say he proved his point im shocked that these kinds of atrocities are still going on in the world today and i applaud stallone for using this film as a vehicle to shed some light on the situation and try to do some good rather than just go for another quick money grab its a perfect example of a movie being entertainment but also teaching you something about how lucky you are to have everything you have and not have to live the hell on earth that the people of burma have tohimself was awesome a living legend its always great to see the heroes of my youth return for one last hurrah and i personally dont care how old he is he still had the intensity he was in great shape and moved around like a guy half his age the magic of editing i know but perception is reality in movies his performance was fantastic and thats all that matters same goes for arnold in t3 a few years ago same goes for bruce willis in last years die hard movie and the same goes for indiana jones in his upcoming movie this summer the naysayers will moan and complain about these guys being too old but honestly who are any of us decide if a person can no longer do something if they still have the desire they can still do it end of storywhen you see them on screen youre transported back to your childhood and you cant help but cheer on these iconic figures you grew up on there were several points in where the audience erupted into applause which in my experience is a very rare thing its not too often that a movie can get you so emotionally involved that you clap or cheer but had a lot of people doing just that its a lost art mainly because the guys who knew how to do it apparently got too old personally im glad stallone told the naysayers to shove it and went ahead with making rocky balboa and theyre two of the best movies ive seen in a very long timei wish some more of these guys would come out of retirement and remind the new generation how its done,cruel
war is in your blood says early in the film dont fight it say what is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here yet stallone utters it without a hint of ironythe same lack of humour applies to the movie iv is an overthetop idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it werent sickeningly violent a redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous it is not enough just to kill them  you have to dismember them with relish stallone stops at no bluecollar clich to make his point it is not enough for the chief villain to be feedthemtothepigs throwbabiesintofire kind of sadist he is also a pedophile homosexualwhat is happening to imdb is it taken over by the rifle society how can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high i like a good action movie as much as the next man but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of myanmar the only good thing about the movie is that sly doesnt take his shirt off for this i will give it one star,cruel
although there could have been a bit more development to john in this installment this is arguably his finest moment i wont give a plot description because there have been enough of those because more importantly this movie is about feeling and restitution the satisfaction of evil being extinguished has to be seen to be believed as johns form of justice is perfect i almost got up and started cheering as he mowed down those disgusting mustached riffraff of the orient it is extremely violent but never repugnant and leaves you wanting to live with john as a roommate for the rest of your life perhaps my own sentimentality adds to the subjectivity of my review but this was a perfect end to one of my favorite childhood franchises but will never quench my thirst for john the greatest war hero who ever lived awarded the medal of honor twice see this movie so a fifth can be made,cruel
i see comments about the violence and gore being totally unjustified in this movie well to fight violence you need a greater violence and one which gives them just thatbut if you think the violence is there just because it has to be well your wrong it actually needs to be as this movie is about a real live situation that is happening right now in burma and with the junta regimewhat they are doing to the villagers and rebels of this country is barbaric well its genocide and this movie captures all that is happening in that countryi wont go into saying much about the movie except to say be prepared for some realistic action and battle scenesvery gory and scenes of torture,cruel
this film is an eyesore the only thing that this film has is buckets upon buckets of blood and guts and guns stallone has a very black bear approach to acting in this usually struggling to deliver his lines through the botox and so they come out as enigmatic grunts the story and the characters are all shallow including himself and i think that the mercenaries meets later on in the movie were too stupid to give themselves names lets see now there is and then theres sarah and thats all the names that we get the country of burma is so stereotyped that they could have just went out to the everglades in florida put up some paddy fields and hey presto they have a burma which is as shallow as the pools that the rice grows inmany other action films even have characters and story lines such as die hard or even perhaps i am legend but has a pure bulk of it devoted to the most sickening gore that is well across the fine line that separates fun adrenalinepacked gore and sickening gritty gore all that seems to be thrown at the audience is a few grunted swear words clichs or severed heads i know that the bad guys are very shady and linear but the way they are killed is perhaps even more deranged than lets say the hostel whereas bruce willis is superb in die hard i think falls well short at the first gory kill and then it all just goes downhill from there all of the film was made written and directed by it seems a gibthirsty fifteenyear old who plays doom 3 a little too muchin some films the gore is evenly divided so that it can coexist with the story whereas in the gore far outweighs the paltry story and is purely sickening men blown to pieces bad guys blown to piecesgood guys blown to piecesinnocents blown to pieces bad guys decapitated and when the shallow characters die you do not feel remorse for them even though this tries to force youthe ending sucked stallone sucked the gore was relentless and anyone who says well that is war is stupid is not war because it blows its buckles and besideswar has stories and characters and heroes whereas is a puffyfaced botox bear who is more of a butcher than a hero and far too overthetop to watch more than three minutes of and no people do not take creed to those who say that this film is great because it just isnt 110,cruel
i was never a fan of the first movie first blood but stilli think its a good filmthenthe other movies about were pathetic and the character became on a parody of himselfnowdirector and actor sylvester stallone resurrects after twenty yearsi honestly did not have big expectations for this movie but the final result really surprised methe movie is not excellent but its very entertaining and intenseone of the fails i found on this movie is that the combination of social message with violence is a little bit unstablethe other fails are minorbutstill with thatenormously entertained me and it did not bore me even one secondstallone does not show glamorized violencehe shows very realistic and intense violence and i really appreciated thatmy expectations for were very low and the film totally surpassed themyesthe movie has fails but it brought me a very entertaining and intense time,cruel
just a waste of timethis is one of the worst movies ive ever seenbad acting bad dialogs bad sound did i say bad actingsssssllllooowwww specially if someone is being killed with an arrow in his eye  totally predictable plot plus more bad actingstallone is once again incapable to create a good movie so he has to use tasteless to say the least things to shock the audience killing children in every possible way burned chopped blown to pieces you name it he did it with children rape young women by many soldiers he even have to use twice the same game of rat racedont step on the mine this movie pollutes your mind,cruel
i am a fan of 80s action movies in the 80s we saw the terminator the rise of robocop rockys many sequels indiana jones the conclusion to star wars etc with all that said i love mindless action that is my biased this movie took the idea of body counting and threw it out the window it is really hard to keep track in this movie when i found out about this movie i could not help to get excited it is all out action with out giving away any of the movie i will say that it is probably the goriest movie i have seen in recent memory the violence level is extreme and the blood flows by the gallons but this time is not the only one shedding bloodif you like action movies i would recommend seeing this movie on the flip side if you get queezy or are not a fan of the action genre do not see this movie,cruel
after watching this movie the first word that comes to mind is pointless after a brief exposition the main 80 of iv has no plot hardly any dialogue no suspense and well very little of everything else really the only thing this movie has going for it is the action if by action you mean extreme acts of hateinducing cruelty by the main antagonists who are for the most part completely faceless and and his allies disposing of said antagonists in very messy and graphical waysand thats it iv has no more content to offer actually if this movie had been made with identical story but with another name and without stallone in it it would have ended up a typical directionless baction flick that no one would have thought twice about the only things keeping it from that are the and stallone brand names and packagingthats not to say action is bad by default movies like for example t2 and aliens shine by delivering action while still building up suspense and plot  and through having antagonists that are often as interesting as the good guys even the start of this franchise i had a lot more to offer actually has some sort of character there beyond the stallone tough guy gimmickin short there are plenty of crappy action movies out there featuring a brooding hero killing hordes of onedimensional enemies  this is just one more,cruel
story is same old same old and the visual effects are totally over the top a human body contains about 45 liters of blood but in this movie i see splatters of multiple liters when someones head is shot off and entire bloodbanks are flying around when a body is hit makers a head contains a brain and some blood not the entire stock and makers people are not walking bags of blood so dont let them explode like so it looks ridiculous so please leave the cgi alone when youre making a guerrilla warfare movie in the jungle its totally unnecessary see the old school first blood movie that was a masterpiece this movie was a joke i guess the real one still has to come yet so sly get to work youve made some good stuff ill consider this one to be quite a mistake,cruel
the return of the 80s and early 90s classics have been hit or miss terminator 3 though watching arnold as his greatest and most famous character was great the movie was awful die hard 4 though it had a good story and enjoyable cast seemed to suffer with overdone special effects i mean come on bruce willis was surfing on a jet while stuff was blowing up left and right not to mention the movie was rated pg13 and not rated r like the previous die hard movies thus appealing to a much younger crowd but then came rocky balboa this movie reminded me of what a great movie can be it had a message a story great acting and it didnt strive to be totally different from its predecessors with this sigh of relief i had high hopes for could stallone make as good as rocky balboa yesthis movie hits home everything about it is great its as if stallone took every element that made the previous s good and mashed them all together to make one bad ass movie the story was there the action was there and the level to which it was presented was very intense this movie is chalk full of gore and it works very well especially since the enemy is built up to be this mindless sick brutal force that thrives on killing the innocent you cant wait until the first arrow cruises through a skull or a knife slices across a throat very intense i recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies because this is one of the best 1010,cruel
therefore yes i was at the press projection and i have only a thing to say my friends this movie will rock the worldstallone is sublime inside the film is extraordinary the personage magnificently is exploited and the end is an absolute killings and a complete butcher shop i have almost envies to resume one to one the arguments of all the beep that descended the film without even to have seen itoutside of a small blow of soft one for about twenty minutes in the middle the film is as good as rocky balboa already a masterpiece to my eyes this is really the only defect 20 mn in the middle where the film advances littlebut the first half an hour this is masterpiece and the final half an hour this is total killings forget all that you saw forget all that you imagined on the film john is better than all that you saw in the bands announceand i finish on the end leave me to say you that you will be surprised and very moved i had the eyes a not very humid ones i did not cry as for rocky balboa but i were very moved,cruel

this isnt just a movie its a wake up call its incredibly violent but needs to be this is actually happening in places like burma and stallone wants us to open our eyes with the help of a movie hero it gets people to listenits powerful epic violent and very important has lost his faith in humanity but retains his moral compass you have nothing but hate and scorn for the burmese army a genocide squad consisting of rapists sadists and cold hearted killers the camera doesnt shy away from the atrocities they commit we see the rapes and the mass killings of men women and even small children and the last five minutes are the most awesome and satisfying action sequences in the history of action moviessome scenes are very hard to watch some terrible things happen to innocent people for purposes of entertainment or the self righteousness that is racism you will be tempted to look away but you should look let yourself become full of hate it allows the ending to have even more impact and so much more satisfyingwatch this film the acting is reasonable the pacing is perfect the cgi is well used and the story has a point its so real gritty and grungy that seeing it is like youre actually there i was glued to the screen and when it was over i wanted moreits so underrated its criminal the violence is not gratuitous the action is amazing and stallones directing and perception of a character are still top notch after all this time the thing about sly is hes not afraidsee it i highly recommend it,cruel
the synopsis is simple a repulsive completely evil militant group of burmese soldiers are wiping out innocent karen villages with christian leanings a small group of missionaries desire to boat to a specific village to help the lives of the people there now a snake wrangler and boatman is asked to take them to the village he reluctantly does the village is attacked by the burmese hyenas who take the missionaries prisoner the colorado pastor finds that his missionaries havent returned commissions mercenaries to find them agrees to take the mercenaries to where the missionaries were dropped off with resistance at first by the mercenaries soonthanks to his impressive use of a bow and arrowsis leading a charge into the jungle to save the missionaries that are under capture doing so a battle begins with and the mercenaries shooting it out with the burmese scum bodies are blown to smithereens by constant weaponfire with getting to use a new blade fashioned through firetruly one of the most violent films ive ever seen and i watch a lot of horror movies i had read previously about how violent this was but seeing it with my own eyes brings truth to what has been written and spoken the machine guns used do serious damage to bodies in this movie bodies are literally blown to pieces with limbs flying skyward and blood splattering the climactic battle even shows heads being taken off and a mans stomach torn open with the guts spilling out but bulletriddled bodies are a constant in this actioner not for the faint of heart the film attempts somewhat when people arent getting annihilated to shed light on the burmese situation the massacreslaughter of the karen village is horrifyingwomen and children are shot pointblank and sly as director rarely pulls a punch the rapes and humiliation of innocent young women arent as elaborated on but we get an idea of what the burmese soldiers do to them like in first blood part ii this film has rainy night scenes where john and his mercenaries sneak into the village to retrieve captured prisoners during this actually rips a soldiers throat out pure bloody carnage once the violence begins it hardly lets up the film even has igniting an old wwii dummy bomb with a major explosion taking out a large portion of jungle with john barely escaping and we get to see what mines do to both innocent karen prisoners and soldiers bodiesthis is not a film for critics the film is mostly a pure action film where there isnt any gray areaits good vs evil and we have identifiable heroes to root for and villains to boo and the violence is gratuitous and startlingly realistic i recommend watching the behind the scenes special features on the newly released dvd just to see how painstakingly difficult it was to make this film,cruel
after a twenty year absence john j former green beret and oneman killing machine is back on the big screen sylvester stallone having successfully resuscitated his other major franchise rocky a year ago has slapped on the bandana again and treated us to a no holds barred tale of getting called back into service to save those in need from those who would do unpleasant things to them the film that emerges is an interesting affair not long on plot or dialogue heavy on a message of noble bravery in the face of adversity oh and a whole lot of blood and guts if you are the slightest bit squeamish this is not the film to seeopens with a brief overview of the ongoing 60 year civil war in burma now myanmar between the military ruling body and the karen rebels in that country we are then reintroduced to john catching snakes and driving a boat for a living in thailand he is approached by members of a church that is trying to get into burma to provide humanitarian aid at first rebuffs them but sarah julie benz convinces him to give them that boat ride after surviving an attack by burmese pirates the church group enters the country only to be quickly captured by the militaryis then pressed into service by a pastor of the church who has hired mercenaries led by lewis graham mctavish to rescue his flock it is during the rescue mission that throws off his life of quiet solitude and decides to open up one big can of whup ass on as many of the burmese army as he can find in his sights because you know that is what he is good atthe character of began cinematic life in first blood an action film adapted from a novel by david morell with a message concerning the treatment of vietnam vets by the general us population that reacted badly to an unpopular war each successive sequel has tried to work a message into its plot and this entry is no different it is uncertain whether the decision to set in burma is because sylvester stallone has a particular interest in that part of the world was trying to make sure it wasnt set in the boxoffice poison that is the middle east or if the script has just been kicking around that long that that was the best political conflict he could find at the time either way we are treated to a tale about men and women being kept down by men of evil who are not afraid to send peasants wandering through mine fields and when all the peasants cant manage to get killed by stepping on the mines the soldiers just unload on them with machine gun fireis certainly a throwback to the action heydey of the mid80s it provides us with a complicated political situation people in distress and the only solution eventually is a hail of bullets escaping from the barrel of a gun the film has an strange dichotomy featuring several scenes where individuals deride the ways of death and violence and saying killing people really solves nothing then violence lands at their feet and maybe a fullyloaded weapon isnt such a bad thing after all i suppose it could be a message on the naivet of people who just cant realize how bad the world really is until they get a taste of it but it is hard to tellone thing about is certain if you dont like violence you had best skip this movie the last 45 or so minutes is pretty much wall to wall carnage and not light carnage at that this is fullon saving private ryan level carnage with legs arms heads and you name it flying about the screen in fact at one juncture it becomes almost comical in an ironic way as shot after shot after shot is just one angle after another of a machine gun firing bullets and people getting ripped apart by it seemingly without endon the subject of acting nobody in is distinguishing themselves sylvester stallone mumbles out some dialogue between maimings and bicep flexing his physical presence at 61 is impressive but the role of does not push the limits of his thespian skills graham mctavish does his best jason statham impression as the leader of the mercenaries and julie benz and paul schulze are passable as the leaders of the church missionaries more or less you dont go to see a movie with in the title to check and determine the leading contenders for best actor actress awards for next years oscar ceremonyis a bad movie not really but it is not something that demands a viewing if you appreciate action in the extreme i think you will find something in to tickle your fancy and if you were a fan of the previous entries follows a very similar formula but for the most part it is an average piece of action cinema that those with a weak constitution may find difficult to stomach after a point if that isnt the definition of a mixed bag i am not sure what is,cruel
there are any number of things that are interesting about the fourth film in which muscleman slyvester stallone who stars cowrote produced and directed the film plays the exgreen beretvietnam vethuman killing machine john the best of which is seeing stallone in action in an action film that remembers the good old days of the bangbangbangshootemup without a conscienceto get this out of the way is stallones best turn as the eponymous character since the original first blood 1982 is much heavier and bulkier this time out in a sign that stallone is using his age at 61 to his benefit in recreating a title character who shows it in his worldweariness and disillusionment with the world and for a 21stcentury audience it also goes without saying that is probably the bloodiest rrated action film to date  disembowelment stabbings shootings exploding bodies babies thrown into the path of torches you get the pointas the character who first saw life in the novel first blood by author david morrell stallones john is now away from the world as we know it in thailand catching live cobras for entertainment at snakewrangling shows when hes approached by a group of christian aid workers led by blonde bombshell sarah julie benz who shares a passing affection for our hero on their way to the thaiburmese border to help the oppressed villagers there his only words to them are go home because the world cant be saved as it also turns out a brutal burmese warlord in sunglasses is massacring villagers left and right and sarah and the other aid workers are taken prisoner so our hero and a team of mercenaries are paid to go back up river for a rescue mission and so let the action beginyou wont find much rationalizing for the relentless violence and bloodshed on display in this film which is decidedly a bold move on stallones part he went before the mpaa and told them pointblank that this is what really goes on in burma which saw a failed prodemocracy uprising against the government there last year a nice taste of current events by the wayis a solid and brutal exercise that returns triumphantly to the days when action movies just didnt give a damn and stallone returns triumphantly as well showing that age doesnt matter only the size of your guns is what matters1010,cruel
frankly i was appalled by this movie disgustingly violent and foul ive had no problems with those things in the other movies i dont think ive heard that many f words in an 80 minute span in my life it was ridiculous well placed curses can be a good thing and add realism to dialog saying it this much is just ridiculous and annoying then there is the violence this movie is many times more violent than the older movies on top of that it was silly people being cut in half by shots fired from a gun peoples heads completely exploding from rifle shots one guy got shot and flew 10 feet in the air it was so ridiculously unrealistic that i laughed all the blood and gore looked so cheesy that it didnt seem the least bit real it was as if there was a sale on fake blood and they had to use it all in one movie some of the worst special effects ive ever seen,cruel
spoiler alertnot sure what you can spoil about this film considering it basically is just death and rape but there you goa group of idiots who think a bible and dental care is going to make a difference in a war zone where people are raped tortured and killed in the most horrible ways imaginable are taken by these charming gentlemen it is up to and a small group of soldiers to get them out of the mess they got themselves into as a result a lot more people get hurt and killed of course saves the day by going in guns blazing its a very deep and moving story reallyits a film and if was a word the definition would be blood flying guts and death so dont expect anything else,cruel
ill get my one and only gripe out of the way first i dont like the title 4 or john would have been far more appropriate but i will call the film fourth blood in this review to avoid confusion between the characters name and the film titlefor the past 20 years john has remained in thailand since his rescue of colonel trautman in afghanistan he lives a quiet life as a snake hunter and fisherman until he is propositioned by a group of simple and naive american missionaries from some quaint country town think of ned flanders and his pals to take them up river into wartorn bhurma where carnage rape mutilations and amputations are a daily occurrence so they can help the sick and teach bible or some other such mother theresa uselessnessit takes some convincing but agrees to do it and is only happy to see the back of them but when the missionaries are kidnapped which was inevitable he leads a ragtag bunch of mercenaries across the border to annihilate every junta in their way but doesnt merely shoot the baddies he rips them apart in ways so bloody it would make jason voorhees blushyes its a rather thin story but so what the only people who would point this out are those desperate to hate the film but if your film taste usually involves keira knightley in a frock or cameron diaz doing romcom then what the hell are you doing watching a film anyway i had worries that the character might not be relevant anymore he hasnt been around since the 80s and he stood for something rather different back then stallone has always played him as a cynic and someone who mostly doesnt care about the world after what its done to him with all of the carnage and cheapening of life that happens daily on our planet it does seem fitting that would retreat to a quiet corner until mankind needs his ruthless efficiency for killing againstallone looks great for his age and this his seventh film as director is certainly his most hardcore at 61 it seems that old sly has more testosterone pumping through his arteries than ever beforeanother thing that worried me was the loss of jerry goldsmith and richard crenna a movie simply cannot be a movie without those classic signature themes brian tyler who is certainly not the best composer in hollywood does a competent if not exceptional job of blending his own tough action noise with goldsmiths memorable tunesrichard crenna on the other hand is one of those actors that really should have lived forever without aging his absence is not explained in the movie but stallone claims that trautman died the day my friend richard died though i did love the black and white dream sequence at the halfway mark has vivid flashbacks to the previous films with images of colonel trautman his voice calls out to him johnjohn until it fades into the voice of a pastor calling for s help its like trautman s only real friendfather figure is still trying to give him guidance from the next worldit could have been longer but legend has it that stallone has a directors cut in the works for dvd and its surely a great night at the movies it finishes of the story perfectly will surely please every single fan on the face of the earth fourth blood is a real action movie no pg13 live free or die hard garbage here this is what an action film a mans film should be,cruel
is easily the best action film ive seen since 300 and definitely the best in the series next to first blood stallone seemed to be channeling legends like sam peckinpah and walter hill with his approach this time around opting for a more realistic and gritty tone than the previous two sequels gone is the macho posturing of firing an m60 in the air while yelling and the shirtless muscle flexing this is the john of the first film only 25 years later hes weary tired and beaten by the world as well as his demonswhat could have been just another cartoonish and fun shoot em up action film stallone brings to another level by giving it some weight humanity and depth by shedding light on the horrors that the karen rebels of burma have faced for decades now but at its heart is still an action film and a damn fine one at that the violence is realistic disturbing yet never feels gratuitous its as if stallone saw the recent crop of safe hollywood pg13 action films and said to the audience this is what violence really looks like if you dont flinch at some of the things portrayed on screen in youre simply way too desensitizedthe casting cinematography and editing are terrific at a little over 90 minutes its a lean film if i had a gripe at all its that i wanted it to go on a bit longer but im an unapologetic fanas a fan of stallones and of hardcore action films i cant thank sly enough for having the cojones to bring john back to the screen if you want high brow arthouse fare go see atonement but if youve missed these types of films and you love gritty quality old school action i cant recommend enough,cruel
this comment is directed directly to sylvester thanks for being noble  you probably didnt have to they probably did tell you not to but you did it anyway  made this masterpiece  very noblenothing does changei certainly hope this movie proves a difference and is helping to open some eyes to realize what genocide looks like in color hopefully its part of a future world where wars are fought for just one reason  the one and only possible reason  justice for humanitynot some made up weapons of mass destruction influence or moneyto mankind your call,cruel
has finally come fullcircle after the success of first blood and 2 poor sequels along with rocky balboa this film has helped kickstart stallones career and give his title character a heart and soul again is also reintroduced to a new generationis set 20years after the events iii is an older character and living in thailand as a boatman and capturing snakes for locals in neighbouring burma the civilwar against the karen people was becoming more brutal and dangerous the burmese army was using a extremely brutal commander who struck at villages at will killing masses of people forced boys to join the army force people to run over minefields for bets and capturing women to perform sex acts a group of christain doctors planned to go burma to work in a village and believing they could make a difference they ask to take them but he refuses at first until sarah julie benz convicts him whilst in burma the village the christains were in was attacked by the burmese army and the missionaries captured the head of the christains ask for assistances asking him to take a group of mercenaries the mercenaries think is no more then a old boatman and dont want him involved in the mission but as they witness a small group of burmese soldiers torturing some civilians is brought into action and convicts the mercenaries all they can to save the missionariesin hollywood there is a trend to revitalise franchises from the 80s partly to save some actors characters this happened with terminator die hard and indiana jones and there are talks about sequels to lethal weapon mad max and ghostbusters stallones career had really hit the rocks after flops like judge dreed and a remake of get carter rocky and revisits basically got him back on taskthe success of batman begins and casino royale show that reboots do work and thats what happened with whilst ii and iii were cartoonary takes a more realistic approach which worked for saving private ryan the nolan batman and the new bond is a more humble and a more reluctant hero and has an even more bleak outlook doesnt do any superhero feats and is a more down to earth character and the violence much more realistic it was good to see how brutal warfare can be and more seriousfirst blood had a serious message about the treatment of vietnam veterans the second two films were just neocon pieces of trash here finds his soul again and tackle a serious issue the burmese civil war and the pile of the karen people the series fines it soul again criticising a really horrible regime which we have all seen on the news the film is very popular with the karen rebels and burmese critical of the regimestallone offers a strong performance and some of the other actors are note worthy especially matthew marsden as schoolboy and graham mctavish as the foulmouthed head of the mercenaries however julie benz was more hit and missthis film was derided by some critics and has a low rating on rotten tomatoes but this is a case of the critics getting it wrong with the film popular with fans and nonfans of the series and has a good rating on imdb i personally think you dont need to see the previous films to enjoy this one but first blood is worth watchingis also a surprising shortfilm lasting 1 hour and 20 minutes it handles everything it needs to and doesnt drag the film outis a bloody entertaining film and i mean that in more ways then one the film has the highest killperminute rate in film hell yeah but surely that honour shouldnt go to terminator 3 seening nuclear bomb kill 3 billion people there is talk about another sequel but i feel that the film and the series ended nicely and a sequel isnt needed,cruel
being lucky on the relativity of the conflict in burma with the attention due to the disaster in the area the movie gives an important glimpse into how the situation really is and it sure does it style hard brutal to the point but yet with undertones and short shocking and hardtofathom situations shortly described as with former s the movie is short and upyourface this one just takes realism to a whole new level when it comes to violence stallone simply tells us  this is war war is some  up  the storyline are more believable this time around as well despite the usual exaggerations and stereotypical mercenaries the movie is gruesome in terms of violence and i am glad it was it was needed for us to accept it was needed to show the dark side of what is and what lengths he is willing and able to go to thanks stallone for giving us back as well you sure had to work to beat rockys comeback and my did you do well thanks for all the great entertainment so far,cruel
im not a fan but i liked the previous three films but the forth instalment is terrible there was no story and was the same old 80s action flick it had brainless violence and gore although i dont have a problem with it but i do have a problem with woman  children being abused and killed it would be ok if it was in one scene but not throughout the whole film every time a ship sinks the woman  children are saved first but this movie shows more body count than men there are many things that should not be shown in the media because its against human nature and the filmmakers should learn that they should also learn that we are in the 21st century and the audience wants something different films like die hard 40 and resident evil extinction has intelligent storylines but anyone could come up with iv other than that the first 15 minutes was so long that it felt like an hour and from start to finish it had an extremely sick discussing and depressing atmosphere especially the scene with dead bodies on the mud and had flies buzzing around them iv received a lot of negative reviews from film critics  about 30 on rotten tomatoes and there is no wonder why,cruel
i wont waste too many words on this piece of crp let me start by saying i loved the original movies in their respective context and time not this oneyou know how some movies are so bad that they actually become good again because of their silliness well this one is so bad that it is simply bad if encyclopedia britannica was to explain the phenomenon awful movie theyd probably paste a still from 4 in the article acting in this movie by most members of cast not excluding stallone himself is so awful its insulting to watch blowing up half the jungle with a explosion big enough to be nuclear and still managing to outrun the explosion is just too much even in a movie to bearin fact the high mark given to this movie by other visitors really makes me wonder what kind of world we live inavoid at all cost unless you loooved for instance league of extraordinary gentlemen or being skullfed because that is the feeling that youll have after watching this movie,cruel
john sylvester stallone is still after all these years an embittered man who cant forget and move on from his traumatic nam experiences living in thailand and working as i dunno a boat man or something he reluctantly aids a group of pacifist christian mercenaries julie benz and paul schulze in a trip to wartorn myanmar to aid victims of the government repression low and behold our misguided missionaries are soon captives of the vicious evil rapacious government troops who love nothing more than cutting off old ladys arms and throwing babies into fire who for some reason dont kill them makes another trip this time accompanied by a team of loudmouthed but largely ineffectual and wimpy mercenaries long story short bullets and arrows fly entrails are ripped out the screen is spattered with ridiculous cgiaugmented gore and all is right with the worldsly stallone returns older tougher and more incomprehensible than ever in the latest installment of the franchise exactly what sly thinks hes accomplishing by rehashing the hits of his halcyon youth is beyond me  but clearly theres something of an audience for these films so why not while rocky balboa was at least mildly diverting recapturing some of the spirit of the original is a bloodsoaked utterly brainless film with nothing to offer but loads of cgiaided ultraviolencethere really isnt much to discuss with the first three films at least had some message or characterization even if they were cheesy at times but this time clocking it at barely 90 minutes 10 of them are credits the movie neatly dispenses with character and plot and focuses entirely on the bloodnguts factor the violence here is ridiculously extreme  rips out peoples windpipes and entrails heads explode bodies are lacerated by 50 machinegun fire burmese are raped and mutilated people are blowed up by mortar rounds grenades and claymores  and its not even realistic or enjoyable because most of it is augmented by cgi stallones direction is horridly inept using rapid cutting that would make michael bay have a seizure not to mention making the scenes in question nearimpossible to followwhat about our characters is the same epigrammatic antisocial scoundrel who kills people more or less because hes good at it the missionaries are whiny wimps who are apparently here to show that pacifism sucks the mercenaries are a slightly more colorful bunch with graham mctavish fun as their inventively profane leader but they are effectively impotent clods who contribute nothing to s mission but a lot of profanity and whining and more people to rescue at the climax the burmese be they victims or victimizers dont have even pathetic attempts at characterizations although we do learn that the evil leader maung maung khin is gay its just impossible to take any of these seriously but its not even entertaining on a base look at these people getting machine gunned way its just pathetic though a few unintentional laughs may be had along the wayis the movie somehow important because it deals with a reallife situation  the repressive regime of than shwe hardly its done in such a cartoonish tertiary way that it overlooks the point and in any case theres no real attempt to exploring the issue  its just a backdrop this movie could have been set anywhere  darfur tibet even iraq  and been largely the same film the burmese army are pretty much more faceless dudes for to waste s violence solves everything policy is a bit hard to swallow too but then no one comes to these films for the politics i hope what more can be said about even michael bay and uwe boll would find it incoherent and poorly made even quentin tarantino would find it excessively ridiculously violent even keanu reeves and chuck norris would laugh at slys excuse for a performance even aung san suu kyi would find the portrayal of the burmese government laughably overthetop even paul wolfowitz would probably blanch at the thickheaded bellicosity displayed in s style of foreign policy and even fans of 300 would find the movie cartoonish and ridiculouswell on that last count maybe not210,cruel
if you like bloodbath films this ones certainly for you the problem with the film is that the story isnt all that special and the pacing is too fast one minute says no to something the next minute after little convincing hes like oh alright then its things like this that bring the film down other than that its an ok film i suppose but again its nothing special,cruel
with a gap of 20 years between iii from 1988 and from 2008 then expectations were quite high for me towards this movie and having grown up as a teenager with the likes of the trilogy then the 2008 movie was long awaitedand now having seen a couple of times i can with all sincerity claim that this 2008 movie was great it is a good addition to the franchise and it is right back in track and in tune with the old movies although a hint of political correctness can be seen throughout the movie but wanting to add a new layer to the movies was an okay change of pace for director sylvester stallone also starring in this 2008 moviein this 2008 movie the story takes place in wartorn burma vietnam veteran john is living a reclusive life in thailand away from his past and the life of a soldier but trouble always has a way to slither back and manages to do so again when is tracked down and asked to help a group of mercenaries trek into burmathe story in was good as it has been in the previous movies but it is not the story which is the main attraction here it is the abundance of action of course and offers more than enough action to satisfy us old fans of the franchise as well as catering to a whole new audiencethe acting in is what you would and could expect from a movie of this type you know exactly what you get here and people do not disappoint sylvester stallone does what he does best here in this 2008 movie and he proved that he was more than up for the task of bringing new life to the franchisewas missing col samuel trautman played by richard crenna in the previous three movies but given his death in 2003 it was of course not possible i just think that the trautman character was almost as much a part of the franchise as john himself but of course it is a matter of personal preferencei thoroughly enjoyed this 2008 movie and it is right at home next to the other movies in any movie collection,cruel
i will clear that i am a stallone fan when i watched this movie i felt that same excitement as the first blood given to me even it falls somewhat short from originaland when i heard that this is directed by sylvester himself i was very excited that he is good in direction toothe movie was so awesome i cant forget it the action in this movie is good as i expected the acting directing all was goodand this movie is worth watching even for non stallone or fansi am excited for the sequel last blood 2016hail ,cruel
we too often forget this is the man who createdwrote and starred in rocky a truly groundbreaking iconic work like many others who have commented here i was totally surprised at and shame on me my prejudgment was that this was stallone squeezing a sequel out of the franchise but i was totally wrong this was an outstanding movie in its own right and not only that shed more light on what has been going on in strongman run amok burmamyanmar than the sum total of all vague political reforms reporting being done by an embarrassed press anxious to white wash the latest excesses of leaning forward for change in that part of the world the khmer rouge dont get a pass in history just because they were mere agrarian marxists and neither do the strongman socialist generals running amok in burma yet go back and look at the reporting for the last decade or more and count the number of times the word socialist has been used to describe myanamarburmaas strong men generals ran amok with their version of meateaters leaning forward for change in their nation as soon as polite socialists get tired of asking and start telling at the point of the gun the apologists for socialism come in with their mops and buckets and body bags and claim not real socialiststhese are right wingers because  they are bad left wingers and the antilogic of goodbad leftright makes saints out of the crips who also battle the local bloods just like in mid20th century europe when the totalitarian nazi crips battled the local totalitarian commie bloods for local dominanceall while the polite social democrat enablers who helped foster the local tribal freeforsome stood on the sidelines after inviting the tribal mayhem and then got brushed aside by the inevitable meateatersburma has been trying to make the khmer rouge look like cub scouts and an uneasy liberal west has wanted no part of shining a light on what is going on therestallones movie does just thatto a nation in silence regarding it as entertainment and passed hurriedly by with little commentsort of like the hunger games with its cant mistake it antitotalirian anticoncentrated federal power message,cruel
i loved first blood and its sequel first blood part ii but i hated iii that piece of crap movie nearly ruined but now hes back and my expectations wasnt only exceeded but full on blown up this is the most violent action movie ever made period ive never seen so much gore in well anything stallone also is huge in this looks like a hulk and the action scenes he handles with ease and boy are there some action scenes this movie is chock full of brutal brutal action but the best thing i liked about 4 is that is more like he was in the first 2 movies and he has got his mean edge back this apart from rocky is probably the best movie stallone has ever made welcome back we have missed you,cruel
its awesome to see john back in action this movie is extremely violent and has tons of action sequences is living in northern thailand and transports people in his boat michael burnett a missionary asks if he will take him and his associates up the salween river to help injured people in burma tries to tell them is a very bad idea but sarah miller really tries to get him to so does it after they arrive and help people some burmese army people come and try to kill them all showing a bloody carnage when finds out and some soldiers return to burma to kill the bad guys and save the innocent so if you love action bloody violence and the series youll definitely enjoy ,cruel
what can i say absolutely kicks butt i love the franchise and after his awesome rocky balboa entry i hoped would be as good and it was i couldnt believe the action and the atmosphere it was so good seeing back on the big screen with a vengeance stallone was superb as the brooding action icon and it was so cool seeing a darker and less comic than the last two entries the throat rip was awesome and the last action scene where he mows down the burmese bad guys should go down as one of the most action packed and gory scenes in action movie history stallone should be congratulated on his writing and directorial skills something he is so often overlooked at packs a punch and is my favourite action movie yet plus its great to see that john finally comes full circle congrats on a great film sly,cruel
tagline stallone goes one step closer to retirement review by neo with the conclusion of rocky series and now the series it is almost safe to say that stallone can finally hangs up his boots with his head up high after almost 10 years of making pure crap movies like dtox stallone have redeemed his career and possibly his face with the aforementioned conclusion to two of his greatest hits like rocky stallone just doesnt know when to give up and if one found rocky physically draining for the incredibly fit looking 65 years old lad and then is bound to surprise you perhaps it is the excessive gore from start to finish that seem to stun the audience but it is really full credit to directorwriterstarproducer stallone in recreating life within a franchise that have already been in a near death coma for more than 15 years with a brisk running time of just 80 minutes is a hugely entertaining film that never fails to stop and when the adrenalin is running neo can assure you that it wont stop till its overhaving watched the original rocky for the first time there is no question that stallone is born for these two roles his stoic appearance stonefaced and stiff english speaking are all attributes that makes him a boxer or someone in the army director stallone is certainly an old school director without devolving into the world of technological special effects stallone keeps his feet on the ground and the result is some real guts and gore just seeing people being blown up is vividly depicted and violently shot while at times the gore and disgustingly real death can be quite fake looking the constant bloodthirsty killings more than compensate any areas of noticeable flawthe plot will certainly be diced by all critics alike but one must be realistic when watching a movie why will anyone care about the plot all we want is to see some real blood and thirst and luckily stallone delivers exactly that then again there is also the now famous bow and arrow shot that made who he is today stallone is also not afraid of showing the atrocious waste of lives in the way war criminals in south east asia are being executedall in all is simply a stomach churning flick that requires a strong stomach for someone to sit through the entire duration as far as popcorn entertainment is concerned easily qualifies as one stallone may well be beyond retirement age but as the rockys most famous quote goes  it arent over till its over perhaps this is a step closer to retirement from one of the greatest action heroes in the 80s and 90s and if thats the case stallone will be able to lift his head up high and above and bow out on his own terms by the way neo strongly recommend you to eat a buffet before watching this movie and as for the reason you will know why after you sit through the entire duration in one piece neo 2008 i rate it 7510wwwthehkneocom,cruel
yeah this was the first rrated movie ive seen in theaters i saw it with my parents but i chose to sit about 6 rows in front of them when the film started it was one of the highlights of the film itself multiple news reels of the controversy in burma and the bet on who will survive in the explosiveinfested marsh when i saw that it drew me into the film as a kid the film was an extreme high octane violent awesome movie but the big cheese of the film was the final fight the best fight scene ever to be in film vs burmese army and the general this was one of them moments where i said constantly holy z,cruel
ive been a fan of stallones for years he plays the underdog so well from the series to rocky from lockup to over the topstallone is an awesome and versatile actor he even did a good job with judge dredd in my opinionthe newest installment of finds john living in asia as a snake hunter commisioned to bring christian missionaries to burma he is again enlisted to save them after their capture by the corrupt militaryshowing he has truly aged he does get help in this one from an unlikely band of mercenaries who at first see as nothing but a regular boatman surprisingly he proves them wrong and shows the world is still able to do what he does besthelp others and survive as wellas he says in the trailer killing is as easy as breathin and watching this movie will bring a smile to your face every time i guarantee it,cruel
ill give this move an 810 the violence and gore in this movie i dont think i have seen since gang of new york from a storyline perspective i think stallone did a brilliant job in showing the world the true picture of current issues in thailand all round we see stallone once again doing what he does best in army combatthis time aided by a team of special forces we see more realistic fighting than the against the japaneserussian army we are used to the army general in this movie portraying the villain is cold he had me shook watching this at the pictures this movie is not for the fainthearted,cruel
i am sure that among the 1year voting will decline to 71 when people are fixed with bias and with the passive film and very difficult to make change my mind good action movie much more realistic than previous years ting sy sided with the americans has a great soundtrack great art and a great realism horrific pictures showing the assault of the burmese army against the karen village now the site spotted the same process that i saw indiana jones a vote with the passage of time caa only the best for intellectuals have high marks my vote is 10 beautiful beautiful film increased the vote stingybeautiful film as to the usual one the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are metsure heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site in fact reviewers good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes because this contrast i know the reason since assumptive reviewers good part favorably sees the past and as the past is better than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular at this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measurein fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers better think separately with its head i was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer sampat go away,cruel
instead he comes back to release something like this 20 years ago john had his last appearance on the big screen  too bad sly didnt leave it at that while first blood actually had a story to tell and the second part was a nice action film which to a lesser degree is also true for 3 this fourth film is  imho  nothing but a poor attempt an aging sylvester stallone with so much botox in his face he could as well act with a mask in front of his face made to hit paydirt one last time i like bloody movies but john has nothing to offer but 2030 minutes of the bloodiest slaughter ive ever seen in a mainstream kind of movie it fits that sly doesnt even carry his artillery any more instead he uses a mounted cannon to dissect legions of enemies from a nice comfy distance to make one thing clear i dont mind explicit violence in films and i enjoyed the earlier films  but this one has nothing to offer but closeups of flying body parts the rating of 77 for this masterpiece is a travesty and makes you wonder if you can still trust the ratingsystem i give it a 3 and hope that others will follow,cruel
this film delivers exactly what it promises a great shootemup style war film if you want indepth character development or a sophisticated plot look somewhere else but if you are looking for an afternoon of watching the famous infamous john take out evildoers with a variety of weapons youre in for a treat if there is a deeper message here it is thankfully buried well beneath the surfacei rated it an 8 because although i think this was pretty close to the best it could be and would love to give this a 9 or 10 however there is little character development or story while i think that including either of those would probably have damaged this particular movie and possibly converted it into a bad movie this means that it can be a very fun and entertaining movie but can never be a great movie at least by my standardsa word of warning this movie is very violent and not because of cartoonlike violence i would not take children to this unless you are sure they are old enough to separate movies from real life and are not squeamish,cruel
 spoiler forget the suits the smart one liners the martinis and poses is back with his trademark stare and snarl and blazing guns this time he has even less dialogs personally this is the best flick ever  a no holds barred movie blood gore and more it starts off with a brief of a war between the karen rebels who are besieged by the burmese army who burns kidnaps mutilates and rape their way from village to villageis hired by a group of missionaries on a mercy mission to bring them up river into the war zone which he reluctantly does 10 days later was hired yet again this time to take a group of veteran mercenaries who have been hired to find and if possible rescue the first group who has gone missinggrittier than the previous 3 chapters 4s story is a lot more intelligent well paced and  i am still wrestling with this  believable the blood and the gore did not feel gratuitous it was there for a reason the image of a kid with his head kicked in and thrown into a burning pyre is still haunting me the cruelty of army is emphasized so many times that when finally kicks in i wanted to cheer even though he was as brutal as they were just like rocky there is a feeling of closure in 4 as we see acknowledging to himself that in the end he is what he is a killer simplethe trailer did not do justice to the movie 9 out of 10 for action movie goodness watch it with a bunch of guys and please leave your brain behind,cruel
this is what makes a great action film a character so complex so brutal that if you looked up war in the dictionary his face would pop up the violence is so gruesome that contemporary films like 300 is tamed compared to its nihilistic attitude isnt for the squeamish and not for the faint hearted stallone tears down the hollywood image of and brings him back to the standards he is not fighting for a certain country or battling a threat to the united states he is merely embracing the very nature that has haunted his character for so many years war is his enemy but his only definition during through all the brutal scenes he engages in you feel his anger and you understand his pain the image of the unstoppable juggernaut that could take down an army is still present in the much older and aged stallone you believe he could win you believe he could take out any man it isnt stallone thats present in the movie its age cant even stop a man that has become the definition of male aggression,cruel
ok i will admit when i first saw the trailer for this i had not seen any of the movies dont not ask me why i dont know either well i prepared myself by watching them all and out of this sweet series i have to say the latest one is the bestnow if youre looking for something a little morewhats the word story driven see any of the oscar nominated movies if you want balls to the wall no holds barred action is the movie for you is stallone seriously in his 60s well i guess 60 is the new 40 the guy can still move still ripped never takes his shirt off in this one but look at those arms and everything else and the violence well i dont know the last time i ever squealed like a school girl at an action movie even when the carnage was over my smile still stayed on my face ear to ear what a blastoh and what was it that tango said about in tango and cash well sorry tango you have just been proved wrong,cruel
i am christ believing man i found this film offensive because of all the expletivesproducers in hollywood must feel that every other word needs to start and end with the letter f  than in my mind they really dont deserve my hard earned money there was probably 100 f words enough to really dislike the movie and anyone who says to themselves half way through the flick  this sucks  has more reason than what i stated above the acting was flaky was superman and hero of course it was just a plain no go joe movie to me not sorry neither just the way i feel if you are a christain and you thought this would be a safe movie to watch think again this is a bad movie something to never let your kids see or hear,cruel
this movie was a travesty to the movie industry it just goes to show if you have enough money in hollywood then you can make bad movies the script must have been written by a five year old alcoholic on acid a sixty year old man could not do the things sly does in this horrible movie my boy joe klink could write a better movie then this its a shame hes not the director of this movie then it would be winning mad oscars im tired of this stupid sequel trend in holly hood because every movie that is below average but makes some money gets recreated the first was nice and i loved eating the most popcorn while watching it this made me think of that bambi deer character and puke i dont like this movie and it should be banned from the united states,cruel
due to one of my friends being a fanatic i agreed to go and see despite not having seen the first 3 i didnt have any high expectations but what i was expecting was an enjoyable fast paced action film what i got was a boring repetitive ridiculous gratuitous mess that has clearly been made to make its ageing star as much pension money as possible before he cant do these mad stunts with no emphasis on even a hint of qualitythere are many reasons why i thought to be so bad the acting is dreadful most of the cast are just annoying especially that bald commando guy who deems it necessary to swear at least 4 times per sentence and the plot doesnt make much sense for instance when the christians first approach he refuses to help them and it is made clear he has absolutely no interest in doing so then enters the entirely bland and unconvincing julie benz and it takes her about 30 seconds of dialogue for her to convince himmy main argument may sound quite bizarre but it is the violence that makes stand out as a poor film i was obviously expecting a lot but here it is way over the top very repetitive and horribly gratuitous it is of those films where the makers just put as much violence in as possible to appeal to action fans just because they cant think of anything new and want to show off how many ways they can viciously slaughter random characters 230 odd people die in the film and about 150 are in the last 10 minutes and it gets incredibly boringstallone is the only actor to come out the other side with any credibility basically because is the quietest characterspoiler he is also the only character we really know anything about  the rest of the characters development really is nonexistent for instance at the end when julie benzs character and her boyfriend supposedly get back together a load of epic music is blasted at you as if you care how can we care the guy only has about 3 lines in the entire film and theyre only brought about when the burmese psychopaths are attacking themend of spoileri honestly cant believe this film still has a rating of nearly 8 it really is awful unrealistic and gratuitously horrible i dont mind violent films if the violence is justified eg oldboy but dont just bombard us with violence to try and cover up how inept your actors are a lot of reviewers on imdb have said things like the rebirth of old action films well if this is like an old action film thank god someone thought to make new ones,cruel
john j the latest in a long line of 1980s archetypal action luminaries resurrected from franchise death by some lessthandivine hand returns with a vengeance in the imaginatively titled sylvester stallone writes directs and stars in the fourth and perhaps most charming of the series in which the vietnam veteran falls in love with a female robot from the future and must win her affection by caring for her magical goat children who only speak in rhyming couplets not really he kills hundreds of people whilst grunting unintelligible phrases and thats the way we like it sure theres supposedly a message regarding the unremitting atrocities in burma but if there was it was so subtle it escaped my detection except perhaps the five minute opening montage of disturbing news images showing actual deaths and torture which serves to trivialise anything does throughout the film really how can anyone derive any enjoyment from the film after seeing what actually happens there well i can a little bitthe entertainment arrives mainly in the final half hour of where the proverbial excrement really hits the fan johnny boy feels obliged to save a number of christian aid workers led by julie benz and paul schulze father foodandsex from the sopranos after they are captured by a regiment of mustachioed burmese soldiers initially he is merely employed as a boatman by a number of mercenaries paid to rescue the aid workers however stallone then aims to answer the ageold question after the mercenaries are captured who watches the watchmen answer does and he kills literally everyone while he does it mainly with a 50 calibre machine gun situated conveniently on top of a hill so he doesnt ever have to run anywhere not that he could because he looks like the human equivalent of a mountain although the deaths do not look particularly good in their cgi splendour they certainly are visceral and more than satiate the bloodlust of the baying young male audience plus there is a british sniper matthew marsden and he kills people too negative aspects encompass essentially the entirety of s running time beginning with the aforesaid news broadcasts and ending with johnny standing outside a ranch in arizona having successfully tracked down his long lost fatherbrotherwhatever other excellence includes the dialogue which ranges from awkward and embarrassing live for nothing die for something to stupid burmas a war zone to laughter inducing we need pythons not cobras pythons the supporting cast are quite ridiculous with each mercenary a pastiche of movie hard men and the aid workers incredibly useless except at providing a higher body count special attention must be paid to the oldschool sas mercenary played by graham mctavish who aside from being not very nice to poor old highlights the fact that the sas do not feel it beneficial to teach their soldiers to camouflage their giant white egg heads during operations in the middle of the jungle and why would they when hes wearing white trousers anyway to conclude any goodwill sly earned with rocky balboa has been expertly wasted in the space of a year with to be honest though what was he going to do with that goodwill in any case i just think more attention could have been paid to the story as opposed to the good supply of body bags direction the film took first blood was one of the best action films of all time and only one person was killed which would have reduced the gratuitous number of clichs promulgated by for ninety one minutes and made it actually worth watching as john j says nothing does change and this franchise still sucks,cruel
john got tamed in the twodecade hiatus that separates his last outing from formerly john iv iv in the serpents eye the vietnam vet has taken up fishing packed on a few pounds and nailed a fauxpeaceful look to his strangely unwrinkled features but sylvester stallone wants us to believe that somewhere underneath his massive frame still lies a killing machine tough job since he slumbers through his own movie as a supporting character rather than the oneman army who almost singlehandedly created the genre that defined the 80swe get a script glued together from bits and pieces of first blood part ii the jungle setting and iii the rescue mission that barely allows the ultimate soldier to wrap his meaty fists around any sort of action after years living peacefully in thailand reluctantly agrees to take a group of christian relief workers into wartorn burma we can make a difference the blonde and frail sarah julie benz tells her sceptical guide who replies repeatedly go home she should have listened as her group arrives at a generic third world village they are brutally attacked the villagers are slaughtered and the survivors why there are any is a mystery taken prisoner gets the news sighs and goes to the rescuehamfisted dialogue aside we expect to at least deliver in the action stakes and deliver it does but the main man is left on the sidelines leads a band of mercenaries to the rescue against an army of faceless bad guys its these taggersalong who do the lions share of the heavy lifting  or at least heavy shootingmeanwhile the baddies are developed not even a little we have no idea why these men are holding hostages in the middle of the jungle nor are we given any clue as to how if at all it relates to the ongoing civil war there but they sure are bad soldiers shoot at prisoners as they run through a minefield rape and decapitation are common practise as counterbalance  and to satisfy the audiences blood lust perhaps  goes heavy on the gore very heavy when the action kicks in torn limbs and exploding heads became part of the scenery in a neverending climax designed for the xbox generation see for example turning a soldier into meatloaf using heavy artillery in one unusually inspired scenethe real problem with is the lack of an anchor the late richard crenna was perfectly cast as the franchises col trautman and for that matter in hot shots part deux because he knew how to steer in the right direction the character is sorely missed here as sly himself acknowledges by giving a dream sequence where trautman tells him to stop denying who he really is a killerthe other problem is rocky balboa with the triumph of his sadandtender winner from last year sly thought he could win the 80s kids all over again through sheer nostalgia but is no rocky he doesnt have a soft side he needs to mope a little but then step straight into the action period pushing 62 the actordirector was in the perfect position to tell the tale of the boxer in need of one last round  a tale that mirrored his own career  but here he can simply no longer deliver the kind of stunts expected from an action movie the charismadeficient mercenaries one called school boy cmon who tag along are a cheap excuse to provide thrills leaving the audience with nothing to cheer but the alltoo fleeting moments an exploding arrow here total carnage there the brief running time  a bit under oneandahalf hours  makes the whole experience bearable but overall feels like the trailer for an adventure that never really ignites,cruel
despite the bunch of this is great commentsclich stamped dumb movie about the good guy convinced by the beautiful blonde girl to get her into trouble and then shooting  everyone  to  save  her  with  the  help  of  a  bunch  of  assholes  who  turn  to  be  nice  guyssorry maybe i dont grasp it i havent seen r 13 movies so im certainly missing something but for one who havent this one is just crapyou want action watch shootem up it at least is funny and has good music fi,cruel
who is writing the good reviews here what a bunch of nutsi sat through this pathetic excuse for a movie with almost no storyline im an action movie fan but crosses way over the line of grotesque gratuitous violence multiple women raped babies thrown into fires heads blown off one after the other hangings a throat ripped apart heads cut off  put on poles legs blown off dissected  stabbed people killed by missionaries using rocks this movie makes braveheart look like a fairytalestallone looks anorexic plastic  barely alive we knew he couldnt actneither can he write or direct eitherthis is a complete waste of time several people walked out after the initial five minutes wish id done the same it was sickening its time to put an end to increasingly violent movies the kids in our inner cities watch these  think its ok to shoot  stab each other at will,cruel
where does one startthis movie is maybe the most horrible thing ive seen this yearthe people who gave it 10 stars are probably shocked to read a negative review but heyi too was shocked by the crapiness of this moviewannabe and what really shocks me is that people actually enjoy itive seen the previous sthey were really goodenjoyablehad a meaning and a plothowever the recipe for this sequel is really cheapwe take we give him guns and other ammoand we let him kill everybody and everythingwho needs a plot anymorejust take advantage of the audience who obviously has problems and enjoys seeing sadistic scenes of absurd violence painted in lots and lots of bloodoh yesthe bloodwith so much blood and i mean itits just too much whos going to notice the absence of a plotlets just distract the attention by using gore and extreme violence whose level is higher than the empire state buildingand maybe the audience wont notice that this movie wellsuckslets just decorate the scenes with limbsheads on polesgutsnevermind giving it a meaningstallone has lost my respecti relied on him to make good quality moviesinstead i get this cheap crap aimed at people who probably torture pets in their speartimesome think its coolwell i think it sucksand im glad to see im not the only one who thinks this way,cruel
i honestly have to say that i was not expecting much from at all it just looked like something that did not fit my tastes in a film and i was in no hurry to watch this movie while i will say this movie got downright disturbing and gruesome at times that was why it was an entertaining and cool film i have not seen the other s before this one and now im actually interested in seeing them because this film was so good the action was awesome even though i felt like ripping my eyes out from what happened in the film at times and the acting was topnotch the script was interesting and the story flowed steadily without any flaws this was a really good movie but i wouldnt recommend it considering i havent seen the ones before this film and do not know if it does them justice,cruel
now that he has reached the respectable at least for an action hero ago of 61 it seems as if mr stallone can do whatever the hell he pleases at several times during watching the brand new and almost indescribably violent its almost like you hear sly thinking screw everybody im doing this film my way and good for him is quite possibly the most nihilistic violent film with blockbuster ambitions ever released and albeit entirely pointless and forgettable it inarguably delivers thrills and great entertainment and pardon my bluntness but  if you walked into the theater expecting anything more than extreme violence and senseless shootouts well than you only have yourself to blame for the disappointment john now peacefully lives in a swamp in thailand where he fills his days fetching venomous snakes and fabricating his own boat propellers he turned his back on warfare as well as on peace initiatives and when a group of american missionaries politely requests him to guide them over dangerous rivers  swamps in order to bring medicines to helpless villagers in burma he simply replies with f the world however when a beautiful female expedition member makes the same request accepts but he still objects and with good reason of course as the missionaries are captured and imprisoned by the sadistic burmese army the precredits opening sequence already illustrated that burmese soldiers enjoy toying around with their pows like for example forcing them to run through an a mineinfested meadow and then still executing the ones who made it so the volunteers fates dont look too hopeful hired mercenaries are sent in to free them and guess who joins the party if you really do feel the need to defend this film you could always say the setting and background of the story are original and absorbing no movie script ever revolves on the dramatic situation in burma probably because there isnt much foreign involvement in this war but the documentarystyled images of famine and dying children at the beginning of the film are just as haunting and nightmarish as those of the wars in say rwanda vietnam and somalia but seriously in spite of the presumably ambitious political undertones you should primarily watch this movie because its john kicking arse more relentless and barbaric than ever there will be blood  and lots of it  but there will also be exploding heads arrows through the eye disembowelment how i love that word slit throats and gigantic explosions one particular and extraordinary adrenalinrushing sequence simply shows sly operating some sort of powerful machine gun sorry im not an expert for several long minutes and singlehandedly massacring the entire burmese army you know what youre watching is preposterous and just plain wrong but its so damn freaking awesome at the same time say whatever you want about stallone but hes still extremely fit for his age although i did appreciate that he kept his shirt on throughout the entire film this time his acting performance is more than satisfying as well and he receives excellent support from several other impressively build beefcakes graham mctavish matthew marsden jake la botz  and the lovely julie benz i wouldnt exactly recommend to see on your first date with that lovely girl you always dreamed of but for all other occasions this is great stuff pure testosterone on film oh and stunningly superbe soundtrack too,cruel
iv is the most recent bloody violent adventure of the world famous you named it john part iv all takes place in burma thailand where an enormous genocidal war is brutally raging john stallone transports a group of aid workers to burma in order to help the wounded innocent citizens who are constantly plagued by the violent and horrible infantry soldiers the soldiers kill them rape them and torture them everyday of their lives warns the workers that if theyre not bringing in weapons there are no lives that will be changed in burma however soon upon arrival the aid workers are abducted by the soldiers and held captive it is now up to and a small group of mercenaries to sneak into burma and save the aid workers lives from the hands of over 100 soldiersi have never seen any of the films there i said it im sure that after seeing this movie that thats going to change i enjoyed just about every minute of this violent brutal and surprisingly effective film as most of us know there is genocidal ethnic cleansing taking place in burma iv contains scenes that show extremely graphic killings of burmese citizens these scenes are not portrayed to excite you or shock you the scenes show us just how violent and awful a genocide really is and very effectively for that matter its even more effective to know that this is actually going on in the worldhowever the movie is a very good action flick once it gets to the parts where its more appropriate to cheer as slices and dices soldiers left and right iv is very well made with excellent cinematography that captures the gritty atmosphere of its jungle environment the editing is very quick moving probably because if it wasnt this movie would be getting an nc17 rating the violence is graphically bloody and gory among one of the bloodiest movies ive ever seen if you are squeamish heres a huge word of advice stay as far away from this movie as possible heres what youre looking at soldiers bodies getting shot apart with limbs and body parts flying through the air people getting slashed and having their intestines fall to the floor and people getting blown apart by grenades so yes like i saidits very violentthe weak points of iv are very obvious the one you probably expect even before you see the film is that the dialogue is garbage and although i wouldnt call it garbage its definitely not a shakespearian masterpiece however the dialogue all has to do with the movies story at hand and thank god does not start shooting off oneliners oneliners work in some movies like die hard but they would make less of a bad ass some audiences even criticize stallones acting skills saying he can only do action flicks but never a serious film well ill tell you that the action doesnt start until a little while into the film stallone gives a strong performance throughout and definitely in good shapeiv also contains a lot of scenes with a great amount of buildup and suspense and when it gets to the payoff its quite an awesome payoff the disturbing depictions of the genocide in burma also gives you a lot of reason to hate the soldiers and want them to die an excruciatingly painful death although im not sure whether or not that was a morally correct thing to root for it didnt matter cause it was mind blowing action i dont think i have ever in my life seen more deaths in one movies or as much bloody violence iv tops them all in terms of violencei must educate myself in the movies by watching the trilogy this one assured me that those films are very likely good as well overall iv is mindnumbingly brutal and an all out action packed movie it is somewhat short but i barely noticed the time length i give iv a 3 out of 4 i expected blood gore and a grisly whirlwind of awesome violence but never expected the effective side of it one of the best action films ive seen in quite a long while,cruel
i read some rewires here that this is a masterpiece and that the movie is a important reminder of the conflict in burma what a load of stuff that comes out of the bottom of most mammals this is a movie made with the intension of making money its a greedy exploitation of whats really happens in burma and you have to be an american to think otherwise patriotism my you know wherebut its fun exploitation if you can call anything just that they did pretty much the same thing in 2 and 3 the only differences is that the us is not that involved with the burma conflict so why do something else nowits a mindless bloodfeast with the steroid eating killing machine at the center its action its gory and most of us liking this kind of stuff will love itsly delivers a back to the 80s action packed popcorn funride enjoy ,cruel
sylvester stallones has an emotional resonance stallone poignantly completes the john saga stallone gets it right not to mislead is brutal and mercilessly violent unlike its predecessors is all realistic carnage surrounding the karen peoples civil war against the heinous burmese regime director stallone reminds us of this with opening images of the enslavement of karen young men and the rape and murder of women and childrenstallones is a heroic icon though originally created by author david morrell john s mythology is really stallones creation there is something pure and zenlike about way back in the second movie says to win a war you have to become war was trained to become the perfect killing machine who transcended to warrior like all warriors honor is in his dna but what happens when there are no wars to fight and you are without equal at killing in i think john is stallones shakespearean hero hold on there for a minute the story by stallone and art monterastelli brilliantly fleshes this forward perhaps remains in selfimposed isolation in thailand because he feels that his usefulness has expired and that the world is better without him the paradox being that the world desperately needs heroes and is a hero in a great narrative touch by stallone and monterastelli is only known as john no one in the story knows of his past however his actions and courage soon define the hero anewthe world of possibility has evaporated from over the years the idealistic missionary sarah julie benz implores to take her party up the river into burma saying we can make a difference reminds her what youre trying to do is change what is sarah has faith has lost all vestiges reluctantly agrees to guide sarahs missionary party that includes her insufferably pious and naive boyfriend michael good paul schulze with incident gets them to their village in burma eventually tragedy strikes and the missionaries are missing the reverend ken howard of their church enrolls to find his people in burma with the aid of mercenaries including former sas lewis a good arrogant graham mctavish and sniper school boy charismatic matthew marsdenhere the storytelling evolves into the compelling granted the action is stark brutal and visually enthralling stallone as is powerful he looks amazing he is vibrant and hulking of hard muscle we all know about the hgh however in acknowledgment of stallone hgh and hard training is the deal i think being older stallone is able to tell a more human story recognizing mortality in preparation for his mission to rescue sarah admits to himself war is in your blood when pushed killings as easy as breathing perhaps you cant change what is maybe you can only go with who you are and ultimately make peace with that being a hero is about protecting the greatness of others at a catharsis pointedly reminds mercenary lewis live for nothing or die for something life goes no whether youre on for the ride or notconcludes touchingly i applauded along with the rest of the audience at the friday night show john is an honorable hero and deserves to find peace in the world the supporting cast is amazing beautiful julie benz gives its soul matthew marsden is exciting youth and strength this is really stallones movie he embodies in the aging the heart of a lion and endearing gravitas stallone eloquently and poignantly completes the story of john ,cruel
as a movie critic it is not possible to rate this movie with stars you must rate it 5  galaxies or 5 solar systemsby far the best action movie ever created combine all action movies ever and they dont come close sly has raised the bar again livesthe start of this movie sets the tone when you see whats going on in burma everything about this movie was portrayed perfectly hats off to all of the actors who contributed from the army to the peace workers you really get a true feeling of what things are really like in the world john is a sleeping giant and though the movie is intense throughout it jumps to another level when realizes what he is and comes to accept it from that point on the massacre begins,cruel
i have been a fan of since i was about 2 years old in fact john j was my childhood hero but make no mistake i was very very skeptical about the new fourth installment i had to be all the actor veterans are reviving their franchises okay so terminator 3 was very good rocky balboa i liked although after rocky v there was plenty of room for improvement but was my childhood hero i quoted and pretended to be since i could remember personally i didnt think sylvester stallone would have been able to do justice to not at his age oh how wrong i wasi should have known better than to doubt stallone whereas the first three movies were created by mario kassar who is a brilliant man responsible for much of the terminator franchise as well 4 was written and directed by the star himself sylvester stallone i knew that he wasnt an idiot if you watch his interviews or commentaries in general you do get a very clear sense that hes an intelligent man but this movie surprised even mestarts out with what looks like live footage from a nation called burma where atrocious acts of violence from the local military are seen i dont know if this footage was real or not but the kind of imagery that it displayed i could easily believe that it was the premise essentially is that a group of religious volunteers goes into burma in an attempt to help the oppressed villagers and as a result get killed or captured by the burmese military a group of mercenaries is hired for the rescue and was supposed to take them to the location but im sure you all know wasnt going to let the mercenaries have all the action oh no the rest however you should see for yourselflet me just say that was by far the most violent movie i have seen in a while it was the most violent of the franchise and frankly it makes action movies such as xxx look like sesame street with vin diesel as elmo i watched a good share of violent movies when i was a little kid but if i had kids of my own 4 would be the only one of the four that i would not show them until they were well into their teenage years now dont get me wrong im not saying that this is a bad thing i loved this movie and frankly i think more action movies should be like if youre going to make an action movie intended for adults you might a well show violence where its due however i can see why they dont frankly is not for the feint of heart there was a scene at the beginning of the movie domino where they placed a shotgun against a mans shoulder and blew his arm off if you cant handle a scene like that then is not for you personally i loved it the burmese military performs acts of extreme brutality where the most shocking of imagery is uncensored i have never seen a movie where they show a child being killed that being said by the time gets into action you really get to hate the burmese military and when started killing the bad guys the entire theater applauded including myself it made it that much more satisfying stallone played the part well i mean stallone is stallone but he is a good actor frankly when i was watching this and i was looking at i saw i did not see rocky and i did not see an italian actor i saw however there was one aspect of stallones writing that i think could have been improved on the previous three films were done in two parts gets into action and kills bad guys a quiet scene occurs either is captured escaping hiding etc then he comes back and hits the bad guys twice as hardthe fourth installment lacked that aspect it was more of a traditional story telling where you have rising action crisis climax and denouement what this means personally is that the movie left me craving for more action however what it had that others didnt was an epilogue which concluded the franchise rather nicelythe music in was largely reused or recreated from first blood the original movie personally i thought it was an excellent touch i dont know how much of it they hired jerry goldsmith to do and how much of it they simply recreated the score but it was reminiscent of the original first blood movie which is always a good thing in my eyes masterful soundtrackall in all it was an amazing action movie with shocking imagery a terrific storyline and a great soundtrack first blood part 2 is and will always be my favorite movie but 4 by far had the most impact i was skeptical about it and i was wrong to be if youre a long time fan of the franchise you will be pleased with this movie if you arent a fan of the franchise this movie might just make you into one,cruel
i dont care what critics say this movie was great the villains were people you didnt like at all not even a little in fact i wanted every one of them to die and that is really what a great action villain should be nothing else and delivered by killing what seemed like a whole country full of themfrom the very first shot of this movie you know its gonna be good the first thing you see is the villains killing innocent people and seeming to be invincible while they do it until meets the first group of them they inspire fear in everyone who sees them dialgue is nice for artsy movies but this is a movie that knows actions speak much louder than wordswhich brings us to himself who looks like hes only gotten meaner since he wiped out an entire soviet army in iii he moves very slowly for the first part of the movie making the audience think if he has any fight left in him until out of nowhere he kills a boat full of river pirates from there we get lessons on why even the best christians need to kill every now and then why the toughest mercenaries in the world are chew toys next to and of course the greatest lesson of all if you get in s way your gonna get shot blown up decapitated crippled decintigrated and gutted like a fish man this movie made me feel great i felt uplifted like your down on your luck and a sweet sweet angel with muscles like trees comes down and kills an entire army just to make you happythis movie gets the oscar forget no country for old men if was in that movie he would have killed that annoying foreign guy in thirty seconds,cruel
i watched the marathon today all the o series at the same time in toronto about seven hours pluso final was an excellent movie i would say o was in this excellent shape although he is 62 but he act like he is just 40 movie was good best effects and the last scene was the best when he was coming back to his ranch with his same old clothes best direction and also the story was excellent in this movie o proves that he was born as a killing machine who live for nothing but die for somethinghe was also the director and writer of this movie in fact he put his 100 hard work on this movie he kept the same attitude mood quite guy but full of strength and determination as previous o series i am pretty sure this movie will hit the box office i will give 1010 to this movie as an action lesson direction effects excellent work sylvester stallone this movie will rock,cruel
first off im not a stallone fan but this movie gave me what i was looking for in a movie was suddenly craving for an action film and watched it again today in 2018 and damn this movie gave me the chills this movie has its flaws weak story poor scripts mediocre acting and probably too much blood and gore for many people but having watched growing up the only impression i got from was as you go in alone and you kill alone one man beats all charges in and decimate his enemies both with stealth kills and his big as guns growing up in numerous occasions such as playing online games skirmishes paint balls etc whenever you see someone charging in alone fearlessly the first thing that comes to my mind is are you freaking and that is exactly the impression this movie gave me one man vs 100 men and still manages to save the day like i said there are many flaws in the movie and the whole movie probably doesnt make any sense but i am glad stallone made this movie and played heard hes making a 5 and i truly hope he can keep being the invincible hero that we grew up watching,cruel
stallone plays again in this great film full of action and suspense this is my favorite stallone film even over the other three films prior to this onewhich were also great movies stallone doesnt fail to entertain in this latest installment of the franchisetwo thumbs way up,cruel
finally we realize that in acting even in action films less is more no one can get attached to a stick figure character with a bombastic personality as we all have seen in previous action films succeeds in maintaining a delicate balance between knowing the characters and understanding them as people i think sylvester stallone did a great job as director the violence is very visceral and disturbing this movie is not everyones thing i have no idea how they pulled off the level of detail the technology to produce the graphic detail is awe inspiring the plot is fairly simple this is the movie weve come to know as a film taken to the next level of the art im very impressed and im not one to usually enjoy this sort of film but i did this one,cruel
when youre pushed killing is as easy as breathing stallone is back as john in a big way with this all out action extravaganza the 20 year lay off for stallone didnt make any difference because he doesnt miss a beat in this film he steps right back into the role so seamlessly its as if he just did the last film yesterday and the result is awesome not only is stallone back in the lead role but he also acts as producer writer  director on this film he does not disappoint in the acting and directing department but the writing is a different story there isnt much plot to go off of and the acting is certainly not oscar worthy but in a film like this the strengths lie elsewhere stallone is at the top of his game when it comes to directing this beast the man definitely knows how to shoot an action sequence and he kicks a at it the action is very fast and very bloody gunshots stabbings and explosions are aplenty to say that the violence in this movie is over the top would be a huge understatement the violence is so ridiculously brutal that the body count is well over 200 none of this however is a bad thing because thats what the movies are all about kicking a and taking names is what john was born to do and he does it to the biggest vicious extreme 50 cal machine guns ripping people in half and a homemade knife disemboweling a corrupt burmese general are just small tidbits of the brutality stallone offers up in this flick as i said before the acting is not oscar worthy but everyone does a serviceable job no need for academy award winning acting here though just straight up bloody fking fun whether or not stallone ever decides to revisit the world of again he will have no shortage of fans lining up to see it and his mind will have no shortage of the brutal over the top craziness it takes to continue showing why is one of the most classic action franchises of alltime,cruel
this fourth movie featuring sylvester stallone as is a very graphic and disturbing sequel where he joins a group of mercenaries in war and genocideplagued burma to rescue a christian aid group kidnapped by a ruthless local infantry unitjust about the entire movie consists of the evil burmaese soldiers kidnapping torturing and murdering villagers and and the mercenaries engage in endless battles with the burmaese soldiers with the christian aid group workers caught in the ensuing chaos this results in a very fastpaced plot and an enthralling story to see how and his counterparts attempt to fend off the infantry and rescue those kidnapped and torturedbecause of the explicit portrayal of innocent villagers being assaulted there are extremely high levels of gore and grisly images definitely not for everybody to watch this does remind those willing to see the movie what goes on unfortunately in the real world in some countries that tolerate genocide and watching this film will definitely make you root for the good guys to completely vanquish the evil forcesthe acting was dramatic and good for the most part especially those of stallone and matthew marsden i like his sportsmanship role of schoolboy who seemed to be the one who allies himself with more julie benz as sarah was ok just a little melodramatic at times and ive actually found graham mctavishs lewis role to be annoying his excessive foul mouth and overreacting were overthetopoverall its a riveting and hightension movie that sadly reminds you of the effects of genocide but also brings out the hero in people who want to intervenegrade b,cruel
without a doubt one of the best action films in more than a decade and a very worthy installment to the saga before i go any further one might look at my previous reviews and simply presume im just in love with action movies or older movies in general but for me it goes much deeper than that action movies headed by men like chuck norris sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger and older films in general are amongst the few things giving me the hope and the drive to get out of bed in the morningthe world around me seems so weak hollywood portrays men today as weak society in general as weak and the world seems lost in a sea of bullshit i get up in the morning i get my day done with and i come home to sink into entertainment not just any entertainment but movies and television that take me back to a world when hollywood portrayed people especially men as strong courageous individuals willing to die for what they believed in films like the movies give me hope they literally help me to believe that the world is worth fighting for and that all is not lost this version of is no different in that regardin it guides a group of missionaries into war torn burma so that they can help the people living there who are terrorized on a daily basis by thugs working for a corrupt regime that has zero respect for human life is reluctant at first essentially warning the missionaries that you cant stop bullets with bibles that the kind of people running burma understand one thing and one thing only warstill leads them in and drops them off as theyve asked him to do soon the missionaries are taken hostage and held forced to watch unarmed villagers slaughtered children murdered and women raped and beaten all the while back in thailand is unaware of whats going on shortly after the chaos in burma a team of mercenaries hired to find the kidnapped missionaries come to and ask him to guide them down river to the village where the missionaries were last known to bethe mercenaries hope to rescue the church group and lead them out of burma to safety but upon arriving at the village they are astonished at the carnage thats thats taken place most of them want to quit and go back but as is typical of his character refuses in no short order one hell of a war breaks out between the army in burma and the mercenarieslet me warn you in advance this is without a doubt one of if not the most shockingly violent movies to date this film might well leave you emotionally scarred for life but yet as with the other installments in the saga its a very poignant film this movie goes out of its way to draw a line in the sand between the good guys and the bad guys it goes out of its way to make you feel the pain and torment of people living under a dictatorship under a crooked regime that would murder a child simply for refusing to pick up a gun further it goes out of its way to make the statement that war can only be stopped by war while we argue politics and political correctness in the comfort of our homes babies are murdered for fun women raped and brutalized by the scum that serve these sorts of regimes and innocent unarmed men of all ages are gunned down like animalsthe acting is so solid here that you cant help but believe that what your seeing is real the special effects are fantastic the direction script writing and cinematography are all nearly flawless but above all like in the previous films becomes the killing machine he was trained to be he fights to save as many lives as he can while putting his own life on the line i would argue that in this film he battles harder and with a greater purpose than he has ever fought before this is a fantastic action film that just about anyone should be able to enjoy provided you can handle the blood gore and violence the latter of which there is plentyone last note if youve been following the saga then the ending here will leave you breathless there is some debate as to whether or not this is indeed the final installment of first blood if it is then it is a perfect finale to the seriesone final and sad note and i truly am heartbroken by it is that richard crenna aka colonel trautmen s mentor and likely his only friend in the world is not in this movie crenna passed away in 2003 long before this movie was made not only am i sad that such a talented actor died but it also saddens me greatly that the voice calling s name when the mercenaries come looking for him wasnt that of colonel trautmen the films makers worked it in such a way that it pays a tribute of sorts to crenna but still its sad that crenna wasnt part of this movie and even sadder that he is gone from this world forever,cruel
is one of those franchises that adds a more confusing title with every new installment so we started out with first blood alternate title then got first blood part ii whos really going to call it that then it started making some sense with the third one iii and this one ishuh how hard is it to just put a iv at the end there end this madness once and for all but anyway the movie itself is pretty awesome it doesnt quite have the character development of the original the dialogues are stupid the side characters are lame but can you honestly hate a movie that has our complex hero kill a herd of bad guys many of the soldiers appear to be recruited against their will which kinda makes the whole thing bittersweet with machine guns using a bow and arrow or one that constantly has shoot the biggest gun ive ever seen from a massive open space but leaves him unscathed throughout this series gave up being intelligent after the first one but it didnt hurt it one bit iv im sticking with this is tough as nails incredibly gory packed with action and has a body count in the triple figures is there anything else you really need to know,cruel
i wondered why after directing four rocky films and staying alive did stallone not grace any of the sequels with his directorial expertise with each after first blood the series grew farther and farther away from what made the first one such a stellar success it was plausible well plausible in comparison to the 2nd and 3rd ones anywaywhats brilliant about is that it gives stallone a vehicle while also bringing attention to the human rights violations genocide being perpetrated by the burmese military under government orders if not wanton and blatant condonmentafter a little hiatus from big productions sans rocky balboa stallone still has something to prove despite his overthehill age clocking in at 62 years young to stallone this installment brings back the modest production and plot with a budget of about 50 million when action films today cost about 65 million depending on release date and cast but stallone did away with the overinflated and grandiose production with a no frills followup this time is back in thailand snatching up constrictors and venomous cobras for the local tourist spot and traversing up and down the river to get said snakes its when a condescending missionary whos portrayed by paul schulze comes to after doing some footwork to get upriver into burma or myanmar as its named that curtly refuses citing their naivete and the danger as well as what appears to the missionaries as him being apathetic well the missionaries dont have any other option and need s boat to get upriver and sarah played by julie benz the fiance of michael paul schulzess character tries her hand and desperation to get that ride after three tries sarah succeeds and then the convoy is held up by pirates and is forced after trying to peacefully negotiate an amiable agreement and much to the humane michaelss dismay kills the pirates to save their own lives this is what helps the audience realize that is not just a bloodthirsty killing machine and has found some solace in himself while simultaneously maintaining a misanthropic disposition its good storytelling that wasnt so quick to kill opting to settle things peacefully rather than the way another thing does well is take some of the limelight off of himself and lets the mercenaries charged with rescuing the captive missionaries stallone didnt just bogart the camera and let all the supporting actors die just to show you is a superman contrary to the perception established by the 2nd and 3rd filmsanother example of the modest production is the absence of the trademarked mi24 hindds that were in the 2nd and 3rd or any helicopters for that fact there isnt any tank battles or dispatching a battalion from a tree armed with just his compound bow and a quiver of arrows also the baddie in this film is someone you truly hate and want to see him get his come uppance that is whats lacking in a lot of actioneers these days this film is indeed gory but it serves it well since the atrocities committed by the burmese military junta are quite graphic to depict it lightly would be downplaying the plight suffered by the karen it also serves the underdogs as you see justice dealt out properlylike a dish best served cold the inclusion of the mercenaries makes the story a little more grounded since they are a small elite contingent who accompanied by a one man army could probably tackle their foes but the casualties would be almost 100 hopefully the fifth installment will capitalize on the dynamics and realism reset by im also glad we didnt see remove his shirt this time something that probably would have been done by another director and made the film just another action vehicle,cruel
this movie isnt for everyone it shouldnt even be viewed by the mentally unstable but it was ideal for methere are the fun action movies avengers comes to mind excuse me marvels the avengers in the fun action movies the good guys beat the bad guys in spectacular fashion the only problem is that we overlook the pain that just caused like avengers the good guys have a good laugh at the end but fail to acknowledge all the dead bodies under the rubble even for me that is kind of creepybut doesnt do that i dont want to give too much credit to stallone but there is an inherent truth to this film it doesnt pull its punches on violence and how it looks the pain this is nc17 people dont get shot and then drop they are torn to pieces by gunfire first a good amount of good guys and then a lot of bad guysbut i would doubt that stallone is much of a peacenici also cant say this was a absorbing depiction of the human condition i liked that didnt have any faith anymore and the jaded blind faith of the women and her arc was goodthe main driver on this though was to vent on all the bad guys of the world and not with a giggle at the endthis was a movie for me a peaceable fellow with two cats who also likes death metal cause its kind of funny,cruel
after three years of not shooting a filmsylvester stallone decided to reprise two roles of the successful movie franchises that he was part ofone was rocky wherein he actedwrote and directed its final installment entitledrocky balboa the other of course was in 2008he did portray once again his other famous role as legendary cold warvietnam veteran john he also directed the film it is the fourth and most recent installment in the franchisetwenty years since the last film iii this film is dedicated to the memory of richard crennawho played colonel sam trautman in the first three films the movie simply entitledstars stallone together with julie benzmatthew marsdengraham mctavishreynaldo gallegosjake la botztim kang and paul schulzethe storywritten by art monterastelli has john survived many harrowing ordeals in his lifetime and has since withdrawn into a simple and secluded existence in thailand where he spends his time capturing snakes for local entertainers and chauffeuring locals in his old pt boat meanwhile the worlds longestrunning civil war rages into its 60th year on the nearby thaiburma border one day human rights missionaries sarah miller and michael burnett show up asking to guide them up the salween so they can get some much needed food and medical supplies to the desperate karen tribe according to sarah and michael the burmese military has planted land mines all along the roads leading into the tribes village making it virtually impossible to reach the tribe via land two weeks after drops the group off in dangerous territory pastor arthur marsh arrives with a chilling message the aid workers never returned from their mission into the jungle and the embassies refuse to help marsh and his fellow missionaries find their missing friends nowthe knowledge that innocent missionaries are being used as pawns in a brutal war leaves him with no other choice than to venture behind enemy lines on his most dangerous mission to dateends the series with its most violent film everit surpasses the the standard of its goriness and violence of the first three filmsbut neverthelessit never fails to provide great action sequences and entertainmentwith regards to the storyit still preaches that war remains the best option when resolving conflicts the characterallows you to cheer for the wrong things when conflict arisesin the endthe film is no longer uptodate to what it used to live back in the from an ideological view but it still works from an entertainment standpoint,cruel
i have watched this movie many times and had a chance to evaluate every part of itthe story acting directing cinematography soundtrack and i have concluded that this movie is quite possibly the best movie of mr stallones career and without a doubt one of the best and most intense action movies of all times it just gets better and better every time you watch it this movie will grow into legend and live on long after its release much like predator the return of 20 years after the unfairly ridiculed third installment a highly underrated action movie seemed impossible sylvester stallone was already way past 60 the franchise was by many considered totally political incorrect out of date and cheesy i guess even the fans must have been worried if sly could really pull it off but not only did he pull it off sylvester stallone created a legendary action movie that has reached new levels of intensity and grittiness something never seen before it even comes with a political and philosophical message focusing on the situation in burma and dealing with pacifism sly cowrote it starred in it and directed it this is his baby but he did get a lot of good help from all the people involved they have all done a superb jobbrian tylers beautiful and haunting movie score is very important to the atmosphere of the movie all the actors are perfectly casted and play their roles wellmy favourites being the team of mercenaries the filming editing locationsi cant see how this movie could have been much better and the final battle scene is beyond intense its crazy most of the criticism against the movie seems to focus on the violence yes this movie is terribly violent and gory the necessity of such a level of violence should be open for discussion is it speculative or necessary to give a realistic depiction of the themes involved  personally i imagine this movie might be a fairly accurate portrayal of genocide massacre and the horrors of war most of it didnt seem out of place to me but i can understand that many have reacted to it but it cant take away from the fact that this movie is a brilliant piece of filmmaking and possibly the most intense and gritty action movie of all times if you are an action fan you have probably watched it many times already if you havent what are you waiting for  full respect to mr sylvester stallone for a remarkable achievement,cruel
heading into the theaters to see i really had no expectations i liked first blood and first blood part 2 a lot and i thought that 3 was ok took me by surprise and once again showed how great of an actor that stallone isthe story involves a christian group that needs to travel to a country involved in a war in the middle east is asked to transport them there and he agrees to even though he knows the dangers that are involved there after taking them where they need to go soon is asked to take a military group to rescue the christian group as they were capturedstallone once again worked his magic even in his sixties his latest rocky movie was great and this film was every bit as good a film as rocky balboa was a rocky film amazing actor in this film he does an awesome job of portraying as a fearless guy who knows what war is all about gets a lot of great action in this film he does not use his trade mark knife and instead uses a machete it does the job also he has his bow and arrow which is awesomethe supporting cast is ok the main female in this film was pretty hot but there is no romantic storyline involving the rest of the military group that transports is pretty good at what they dothe story is pretty easy to follow and you really do not have to wait long for action to get goingspeaking of action this film is extremely violent those who are easy to upset because of violence in films should not see this one there is a lot of body parts that go flying around as well as a lot of gruesome deaths that are seen on screen not a family film by any means also they show some disturbing photos taken from wars that are really going on in real life so just be warned that this film has a lot of violence which you may find disturbing the only real complaint i have about this film is at times i think they may have had a little too much violence that i guess they thought was necessary but i do not know if it really wasoverall this is probably the second best of the series a great film that took me by surprise there is a lot of violence that kind of goes overboard but this is a great action packed film stallone is the man and once again he shows he is even great when he is in acting in his sixties i recommend it to anyone who can tolerate extreme violence on screen,cruel
this movie is just pure action galore for action fans alike while yes there isnt much to go on for drama or stuff like that it is just action through and through being based on a real war that is rarely talked about it is a good look at the underbelly of conflicts that arent so well known as the war in the middleeast which is popularized by hollywood to make a quick buck but by looking into not so known wars it will give the audience a look from a movie perspective of the gritty horrors of war,cruel
i dont know what critics want from this moviewhen i was a young kid i used to think movies were bad movies i had not even watched that much of them but i knew it was about a half naked guy firing a machine gun from the hip killing a bunch of foreign bad guys and the thought of how unrealistic and stupid that is kept a grimace on my facelater while my views on s artistic value were perhaps justified i have come to understand and appreciate the adorable style that these movies consciously went for and for which guys liked them apart maybe from first blood these were the overthetop stupid 80s macho action flicks and everyone was in on the jokeso when you hear that is back with another movie what are you to expect probably a shallow excuse of a storyline that is needed only to place an oiled up stallone and his oversized machine gun into some poor 3rd world country where cartoonishly evil bad guys dont need an excuse to be mauled down for the remainder of the moviewhat we got however was much more than expected stallone who has shown himself as a capable movie director was now at the rudder and he improved the old formula of by mixing modern elements of angsty realism and you know what the two cultures mixed together perfectlythe story still feels like a placeholder for the action  some hostage rescue  but stallone is serious about it the movie engages in a discussion about naivety faith cynicism and righteousness frankly i cannot say that it succeeds at that it is just too short to both move the action along and discuss serious philosophybottom line the only thing i still remember is the action and it is good in a way it is better than the old movies the gritty realistic brutality fits more its like the new movie went all the way where the last couple of movies did not it feels crisp dark and,cruel

john is a piece of controversial art in the manner apocalytica or saving private ryan are with brutal and shocking footage and gory scenes for here sylvester stallone reopens the debate about how far must an artist go to impact and in the same way respect his audience but where is the limit to it the old has died to give birth to anew hero more sinister merciless coarser and bolder than ever the john james looking for an opportunity in life among his fellow men is no more and with him have disappeared the funny quotes pioneering clichs and a straight play from stallone which brought him fans from all over the world including myselfbut even if the new only takes life when he kills more than 5 burmese soldiers in a row this film runs away from the fancylike situations of its prequels and shows us what war really is and how it goes in many parts of the world at this very moment its admirable that one of the most charismatic and famous personalities of the hollywood industry can come up with a film that reaps apart any big business convention of how films should be to be at least bearable for all the happy consuming blockbuster families across the globeas orgasmic must be the blast of blood and gore for the fans of the genre the morality here is that war sucks and that war heroes are ugly and grim men nothing knew under the sun but had to say it a simple film with brilliant effects ad hoc dialogs and well produced in overall yet the fate of remains unclear as always not for the faint of heart710,cruel
saw it twice in theaters and i love it great action good acting surprised of the gore and how many soldiers kills i was shocked at the gore i never expected stallone who also directed it would go far like that but its not like a horror movie when the village is attacked by the burma soldiers i believe that can happen in real lifehow many people die in the film 236 more than shoot em upas a sequel it so much better than first blood part ii and iii i never cared for them but i love the first one and this the true sequel to first bloodi knew this was going to be a good sequel because after seeing rocky balboa that was a good movie and this is tooto the men watch it,cruel
let me get this out of the way right off the bat is one of the very best action movies i have ever seen and at fifty years of age and an action movie buff ive seen a lot of em over the yearssay what you well about sylvester stallone but in he has crafted a action film for the new millenniumit may very well be the most violent movie ever madein fact forget thatthis is the most violent movie ever made but its a pure adrenaline rush and a spectacle of technical efficiency to beholdso be warned this movie is not for the faint of heartor for anyone easily disturbed by realistic graphic violence the other films even spielbergs saving private ryan are bambi compared to this but the most surprising in fact shocking aspect of this movie is how truly well made it isstallones work behind the camera is exemplary the cinematography first rateeven the acting and i mean each and every actorfrom the extras most of whom get blown to pieces to the baddies and the mercenaries up to and including sly himself as our monolithic monosyllabic monochromatic hero john are virtually flawless stallone obviously knows how to get the most out of his actors its all very impressiveeven the script and dialogue arent that bad usually a major drawback to watching any stallone film but here he actually has something to say and he screams it out at the top of his considerable lungs using the real life atrocities of the burma now myanmar conflict as a backdrop for the onscreen violence stallone knows how to get the viewers blood boiling and that realism has a way of buffering the onscreen carnage to an extentthe graphic realism of the extreme violence is enhanced by the use of actual video footage of the crimes being committed against the people of burma in the opening sequence brutal gang rapes torture beheadingsno stone is unturned hereeven depicting the top baddie as a homosexual pedophilestallone leaves all the rules at the box office doormany will undoubtedly regard this as simply gratuitous pandering to the masses and i suppose it is but once again he is trying to make a point its just a movie to be sure but combining the welldocumented real life trauma of the burmese people with the graphic imagery its hard to write this off as pure exploitation of the mediumthis isnt rocky or any of the other filmsits squared sure its as boldstroked as a kindergarten finger painting and the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined as in a corner store comic book but its all done so professionally its hard not to be impressed with stallones achievementon a personal level its also one of the very few films ive watched backtoback in some very elite company the few films ive watched backtoback include pink floyd the wall jacobs ladder the sand pebbles and the professionalthe use of violence is technically more accurate than most movies i have ever seenthe claymore what happens when a human being is shot with a 50 caliber machine gunits all so realisticas for the story i usually dont give much away but this time i will break traditionjohn has retired and lives in thailand he makes a living captaining a boat and capturing cobras and other snakes and selling them to a nearby village for the sake of entertaining tourists then one day he is approached by a group of christian missionaries trying to help burmese civilians in dire need medical assistanceof course after initially declining he takes this group of clueless yet wellmeaning christians up the river to burma and the missionaries are soon capturedsoon after the the leader of the church based in colorado subsequently comes to asking for his assistance in leading a group of mercenaries up river to get his people out aliveif in fact they are still aliveafter initially being shunned by the mercenaries soon joins invia bowandarrowleave the rest to your imaginationif you have the imagination of saddam hussein on acidsome of the dialogue is actually quite amusing in its appalling realism for example when the british leader of the mercenaries is about to be executed he spews some of the more vulgar language ever exhibited in any film ever made and yet its totally believable well done sly sylvester stallone himself is a spectacle to behold what a marvel he isa physical specimen that should be donated to the smithsonian for research after his deathif he ever dies although sly doesnt take his shirt off in this one he is still a man among menbut after all hes not humanhes i mean hes sly stallone now a gifted filmmaker and a beast of epic proportionenjoy this film if you can i certainly did,cruel
this is an awful awful movie mr stallone please please im beggin you do not participate to another film if i watch a nother film of yours im gonna puke all over the floor please consider my suggestion and take me as a brother mr stallone take it easy dont get any hard feelings but im must say you are the worse actor in all damn world the movie is full clich you are beaten by a nother guy and take him in the last second what is the deal so you are the worlds savior really i dont need especially you mr stallone to save my damn worldso you better hide well with your green paints in the damn forest before i finger point you out from hollywood,cruel
starting with 100 years old stallone missing his wheelchair going through incredibly not cool at all bloody effects and ending with a disappointing story not to say plain childish i thought i will change my opinion about stallone after seeing rocky balboa but the disappointment just grew if he needed some money i would have been more than happy to donate some but he really shouldnt have created this totally awful movie i would not recommend this to anyone i have to mention that the first movies in the series were quite good with a more intelligent story all in all bad movie old stallone unnecessary over bloody effects heythe guys who came up with thoseits a movie not a documentary or a horror extremely disappointed,cruel
i was always anxious to see this movie the first movie was great it was about a disturbed vietnam veteran trying to avoid trouble but trouble always has a way of finding him part ii and part iii became comicbook yarns with every action and war film clich you could imagine chronicling s adventures to rescue pows still held captive in postwar vietnam and then rescuing his friend by helping the mujaheddin in wartorn afghanistaniv does an excellent job in carefully avoiding the extravagances of ii and iii in my opinion it is the best movie since part ihas been at peace for many years living in northern thailand making a living out of collecting cobras and building boats his only friend colonel samuel trautman has passed away the movie does not mention how or when so has been isolated from the outside world however trouble has finally caught up with him when a group of christian missionaries ask him to borrow his boat and try to save lives in burma into a warzone is reluctant in sending a group of unarmed missionaries into the lions den but vows in cut ahead to ten days waking up after experiencing flashbacks footage of all its predecessors and dialogue of the late colonel receives the news that the missionaries have been captured alive in a raid that packed almost the entire village they worked in this time takes the initiative to rescue the group and get out but this time he is being aided by an number of elite mercenaries going back to hell once again if hell had a place on earth it is found in this countrystallone has made an unexpected ko last winter with rocky balboa which to me is the true sequel to te oscarwinning film he delivers the same result to first blood the movie has a selfsufficient and complete back story to it authentic performances from sylvester stallone and most of the cast as well as a series of eyepopping and very bloody action scenes the films graphic violence make platoon braveheart and gladiator look like kiddie shows however like the aforementioned movies iv gives a very realistic view of what wars are all about something not reflected in its predecessors wars are not a warm romantic business theyre extremely cruel turning rational human beings into wild savages creating a world where even the phrase human rights does not exist and where unspeakable unimaginable things occur on a daily basis the movie is not prowar quite the opposite it shows us the great brutality of all armed conflicts past and present an aspect that has played an active role in moulding world history the movie shows scenes of massacres of entire villages being packed to death of brutal interrogations rape and other horrible things the extreme violence in this film is brutal as well as appealing in a manner similar to paul verhoevens moviesdefinitely not for the fainthearted is no stranger to controversy and here he definitely will keep people talking once again this time with a realistic and honest approach about the dark side of humanity this controversy will definitely bolster s popularity sly youve made my day once again,cruel
we can think of only a few actors who have mastered a niche committed to it and remained in it to deliver solid entertainment for more than one generation very few of those actors have been equally as good as screenwriters and directors with which comes along a generation after the last in its series sylvester stallone unquestionably steps onto the stage as an extraordinary feature director the film is the best in the series curiously enough tracing back to the earliest one in the characters ascension into consciousness albeit the most horrifically violent one with brutal scenes bordering on surrealism while we are mentioning all this good stuff we might also add that few actors have also created franchises on two distinctly different character lines in fact just now no one comes to mindwhile being an action picture is not without subtlety nuance and some depth the embittered and sour john is somehow touched by a missionary in poetic visual realization so light on dialog that we remember why good films tower when it comes to the communication of emotion the missionary a role beautifully rendered by julie benz whose looks and talent should have long ago launched her into the a list seems to have been perfectly cast the final scene in this film is inspiredthis film puts to rest any further questions about the talent of sylvester stallone who will age like fine wine if we were to type him we would call him a brawnier and brainier charles bronson whose many memorable vehicles would fit stallone to a t at this juncture it looks like stallone would even improve on them,cruel
im going to open with a few comments firsti am a huge stallone fan ive been dreaming of his comeback for years and i think his work on eighties and early nineties action flicks is completely unprecedented he is the master the series the rocky series which came to an incredible culmination and return last year see my review and now is back i watched all three of the originals again probably only my second time in totalsee my reviews for all three and i was ready for anything that they could throw my way i admit my expectations were too high because this was like watching an idol return after years and years away didnt disappoint me per se it just wasnt mind blowing it lacked the same story and heart that really all three of the other installments had instead stallone took the helm by directing writing and starring in this installment which i have to assume at over sixty years old will be his last oneand blew away everything in sight in hands downlisten closelythe most violent movie i have ever seen nothing even touches the blood guts dismemberment shocking kills including children being shot in the chest several times can they even show that nothing 300 looks like a disney film compared to this unfortunately the violence and dismemberment is so obtuse and blatant that it borders on corny and youre almost laughing at everything flying about still it kind of makes for a cool time for the red blooded male and his friends who want to thumbs up ridiculous kills like that basically is john losing his freakin mindsylvester stallone returns after twenty years to play one of his most famous roles as john has retreated to the small villages in thailand and works as a snake handler among other odd jobs but right away you notice that has become completely disenchanted with the world even more than he ever was before he makes this crystal clear when he mumbles fk the world to someone stallones is still brooding and quiet perhaps more than ever before it seems like he had three lines in the whole movie his age shows because he definitely doesnt have as much versatility in his action scenes he spends most of his time behind a turret gun which entails the most gruesome gun down scene in movie history still stallone is stallone and this is why we love him julie benz is a missionary that takes to for some reason who convinces him to help their little group get up river into a war zone for the most part benz is kind of boring and doesnt really impress and i know she can do better because i was a fan back when she was on buffy the vampire slayer and angel long time tv character actor paul schulze is benzs husband and leader of the missionary group he is terrific although he only has a small role he really does impress especially in his last scenes when he driven to do something he hateskill the only down side to his performance is the absolutely campy and awful wave goodbye he gives to as they lead him awayawful graham mctavish is the best of the three mercenaries although i think their roles mostly ruined the story but his performance as the tough as nails mercenary who always goes toe to toe with in a war of words is pretty good but never really get his vengeance on him considering all the nasty things he says the other two mercenaries are barely distinguishable and dont offer anything significant to the castso outside of stallone himself the cast is sub par at best and even though i never thought much of crennas role he was a series staple and sadly missed one thing has remained the same with hes always been the lone wolf acting alone against armies and this time he has three mercenaries with him who just get in the way its not if he has a team and that part of it was poorly decided on stallones part i think also there was no exact villainit was like the entire group that were the villains but there was no one person on either side that stallone clashed with like the other films had i think these were vital mistakes outside of the tried and true experience twenty years ago still you wont steer wrong for straight on uninhibited action and nothing but in this film you will see the goriest gun scenes where practically every gun blows limbs off someone or heads or just makes them explode into tiny flesh ridden pieces you will also see hands down one of the coolest damn explosions in action movie history where ties a land mine to an old ww2 rocket of some kind which obviously still works and the whole kitten kaboodle explodes so dont go into this expecting intelligence or story although there is some remnant of the original soldier vs himself still left but go into it looking for some unbelievable never before seen action and you wont mind it one bit welcome back mr stallone you still got guts 710,cruel
and it was worth every penny id seen the trailer some months ago and was sooo excited but when i heard last week that the film was not being screened for critics aka were afraid reviewers will skewer our film and stick its proverbial head on a pike and no one will want to go see it i was concerned but then my ever wise husband reminded me that is and is awesome screw em critics put little stock in kickassedness sly didnt make this movie to bring home statues he made it to bring closure to one of his most famous characters and kick some serious badguy butt in the proccess is a hardened husk of a man whom in this film showing little more than an inkling of the emotional blubbering although ultimately vindictive vet of first blood manages to kick more ass than ever before there is a massivenes of carnage and brain matter involved that will leave you happy as a kitten in a sun beamhes freakin old and done and tired of the world you cant change what is and all that a spirited missionary and her ilk trying to bring spiritual comfort and meds to wartorn burma commission him to boat them to a local village from this point on its all laughoutloud handclapping awesomeness i dont want to spoil it but then my descriptions could not even begin to do justice to the goings ons just see it if you like sly and guns and guts and exploding heads just see it,cruel
okay folks this is proof right here that action films can still be done right i wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who has any interest in it whatsoever at first i wasnt sure what to expect but i just saw today at the theater and it blew me away it was an intelligently told story and the acting was top notch sly stallone still has his star power and like rocky balboa proves thisthis is a movie that you must see on the big screen i wont give anything away but the character arcs are awesome and touch your heart and the ending just freaking blew me away a perfect ending to an awesome series i will buy this on dvd the moment it is releasedcongrats to you sylvester stallone youve done it again,cruel
stallone even said he couldnt come up with any good script ideas for another he was right the movie was so bad i turned it off before it was over it looked like it was shot with a video camera and the fx was just as cheesystallone looked wore out and beat up like a old dog but i dont mean that in a mean way its like they tried to deliberately make him look that wayalso their were no characters that i could hate or likethis is one film that should have never gotten made what a damn wast of money but i guess stallone needed the money it ant cheep living in beverly hillsi still love stallone though even after all my negative comments i wish he would make another rocky i didnt like the fact that rocky lost the fight in the new film balboamark pfeltz aspiring indie film maker,cruel
so let me get this straight gets a rating of 88 that means that this movie outperformed black hawk down 76 blood diamond 80 and bourne ultimatum 83 really its really that much better than those three critically acclaimed box office favorites is it really true that viewers in a frenzy of stallonic appreciation spontaneously entered remarks like a masterpiece simply excellent as good as it gets the best of the series so far this movie will rock the world and my favorite an action movie with a message all glowing comments entered within 24 hours of the films release almost exclusively written in short punchy professional prose in less than 150 wordsreally more likely these socalled rave reviews are part of a buzz campaign engineered by the films promoters in marketing terms this is called web raiding and its sad to see how something so obvious has made its way unchecked into imdbsorry but im not buying it,cruel
i hope this second comment of mine wont be deleted also  i posted a few months ago in january 25 a critical one however very decently phrased and some fanatic admirer of reported it to the imdb moderators who erased it without even checking the contentin short this tired and limp sequel is simply a useless insult towards the old first blood 1 had been a moral and honest antiviolence manifest while this piece of trash is a hysteric apology to violence the script is linear sort of like lets go there massacre a few hundreds of people then come back  well he comes back for real since in the end we see him pussyfooting on a road in the states for no reason at all where is the big epiphany that sent him back home maybe in that inane piece of text that he delivers in closeup on his way to the slaughterhouse when he says some deeply meant philosophic gems like world is bad cause people make it bad and its not nice to kill better be cool and summer aint the same as winter point ticketh spokethsly my boy you bungled it big time sorry for you it was cool as long as it stood but now better go rock the swing of your grandchildren and read them pussn boots got it,cruel
forgive my poor english but i just saw one of the best movies i have ever see in my life by far the best movie directed by sly amazing touching i woke up early morning and i run as fast i could to the theater for the morning screening i was alone in an empty cinema so i cant tell u how the audience respond to  the movie started as i expected and during the film i was thinking all the time that this movie is superior than 2 and 3 but not better than first blood until the last scene came with the twist that i didnt expected to be and i totally change my mind yes my friends this is the movie of the year the remarkable comeback of sly the best movie ever for the first time in my life i got tears in my eyes watching a movie am a rocky fan and less fan but the last 5 minutes of touch me so much that i couldnt believe it as a fan i rate this movie 1110 thank u sly please keep directing your movies you are my favotite directoractor,cruel
when rocky balboa came out 2 years ago my first reaction was oh man thats just what we need another rocky picture but it was actually the best rocky picture since the original the best of the sequels i had the exact opposite reaction about the 4th installment in the franchise and i have to say that this is by far the most violent film i have ever seen and this goes without saying  it makes first blood look like something out of nickelodeon it basically starts out with real footage of attacks in burma and then shows us the sixty year old in the heart of the jungle fishing with a bow and arrow later in the film he is approached by a group of volunteers with burnett as the group leader who wishes to bring medical attention prayer books and support to the karen tribes people in burma but of course is aware of the horror in burma and tries to warn them but doesnt succeed obviously the group encounters some major problems in burma and a team is sent in to rescue the group with you guessed it as the boat man since he knows the jungle like the back of his hand it doesnt take too long for the team to realize that their boat man is actually a machine built for wari saw this film on the big screen with some friends of mine and i couldnt stop laughing at the action because it was just so over the top and so cheesy even my friends were laughing but to my surprise they loved it there is even a scene where literally rips out a mans throat with his bare hands and another where turns a huge machine gun on one person only and tears him to bits now that is as over the top as action can get its a pity that stallone chose to direct the film in this direction because this film could have been really good it had some really nice shots in the beginning when hes finishing in the heart if the jungle and there was a good scene when he kills for the first time in the film on the boat to save the groupbut then its all just down hill from there and stallone doesnt really bring anything new to the screen about there is even a dream sequence where is tortured by his past and is way too long for a dream sequencei loved first blood from 1982 but that was it it think hard core fans will love this film and probably even fans of the ridiculous saw franchise for its enormous amount of blood and gore but i found it to be more cheesy and extremely over the top than entertaining,cruel
i have no doubt that many of the criticisms levelled at this film are valid the plot is wafer thin and some of the characters are a little flimsy but to criticise the film on this basis is to miss the point isnt meant to be a deep characterdriven drama its a stupendous action film with a decentenough message behind itso far as the action goes  and there is quite a lot of it  its hard to imagine any film being more impressive although some of it is slightly exaggerated much of it does feel quite authentic and its certainly the most violent film ive ever seenthe message of the film is fairly simple and is best summed up by himself when he offers other characters the choice between living for nothing or dying for something its almost like a feelgood movie with massacresall in all this is a hugely successful achievement stallone is exceptionally good and its hard not to cheer at several moments when comes out on top id recommend it to anybody with a strong stomach,cruel
in the line of goingberserkwithadrenaline action this is another installment of nostalgic series compared to the last three there is no emotional tension no such a crenna as a fatherfigure i am astonished that i was so really hooked up by the brutality and graphic severity of action as not to recognize the movie was already over after about 80 min every piece of human flesh is totally exploitedheadexplosion by a super power sniper gun beheading with custommade machete jackhammering human body with 500 machine gun harakirilike disembowelment etcand its setting another score for a new breed of series too sorry for old stallone to go naked and expose his old titties the last scene is a direct copy of the first installmentsame costume same mood same scenery possible is that sylvester is trying to close the chapter of his own era by finalizing both and rocky and by sealing them as legend is it worth idont think so,cruel
this is the type of movie that men in their midtwenties have been waiting for growing up we watched a great many killemall actioners such as commando 12  3 and so many more we knew they were corny we didnt take them seriously they hopefully i speak for all of us didnt influence us to cause harm  we just watched them because they were great recently most action type movies have focused primarily on special effects fastmoving kung fu and the like while i dont want to take anything away from modern action movies i hope i speak for a great many adults in their twenties and thirties when i say that this is a movie that weve been waiting for political correctness and all that stuff aside this movie really serves as a testament to the great 80s action movies if you didnt grow up or arent familiar with the classic 80s and early 90s action movies you probably wont understand why some people think this movie is so terrific dont sweat it  sentimentality is a beautiful thing thank you sly,cruel
come to see this great movie for the action and horrifyingly realistic and most welldone war scenes ever put on film leave with a changed perception of the true nature of evil and what it means to take a stand for justice for those who cannot do so themselves this movie reminds the audience that terrible regimes and unbelievable brutality are a part of everyday life for millions around the world just google conflict in burma and look at the children mutilated by third world butchers an uncomfortable but true message seeps through the entire film that although war is horrible it is a necessary evil that is needed at times to bring justice and some semblance of peace to rough neighborhoods throughout the worldwithout ever explicitly saying it unlike crappy political flicks like lions for lambs that cram their political messages down your throatthe film shows that the cruelty and injustice against humanity is not something that onlookers can stand idly by and not respond s decision to kill to save the lives of the innocent and defenseless is done without apologies and political correctness and it is a pure marvel to witness especially in a time of vacillating politicians and political correctness run amok s actions mirrors that of any sane viewers wishes they could do s work themselves why else does the audience cheer when he goes apehsit on the worst villains imaginable is a cultural icon a true hero to be celebrated in an age when antiheroes are the norm it is universal to identify with the character as an embodiment of independence strength conviction and couragemore movies like this should be made as a remembrance of the brave soldiers who have saved and liberated people around the world and that although war is horrible it is unfortunately required in a day of terrorism and despotic third world regimes anyone who sees this movie and says it is just mindless warmongering is intellectually dishonest and needs to move to burma and experience it for themselves this film honestly reminds you that being proud to be an american is not cheesy patriotism but supporting a higher ideal of doing something about the problems in the worldyou owe it to yourself and your grandchildren to take a couple hours out of your life and experience this profound intense piece of art and let it impact you,cruel
this doesnt necessarily contain spoilers persay but i do suggest that only people who have seen read this words cant express how satisfied i am with this movie first id like to start off saying that this movie was so good i plan on seeing it again tomorrow night im afraid the overload of asskicking might have been too much to fully appreciate the first time around so perhaps revisiting this film will bring out some of the nuances that really make great for instance the violence burma must totally be the absolute worst place in the history of the planet my absolute favorite part was the violence against children in this movie never before have i ever ever seen someone take an infant and throw it into a barbecue pit then having a guy come in with a flame thrower to top it off wow i loved loved loved the land mines that game they played was fantastic an excellent touch was ripping a guys throat out with his bare hand i would have been satisfied by the time got to the 50 caliber antiaircraft gun but this movie was relentless most useless award goes to the burmese rebel alliance in the final battle sequence by the time they arrive is already in 50th fin gear and half the population of burma is in a bloody pile of south east asian carnage the likes of which the world has not seen since pol pot the biggest mistake the burmese army made besides messing with was when they didnt take the opportunity to retreat when ran out of ammo this movie makes it very clear that is living his life to kill sure in the final scene he returns home to some ranch in the us but that was just one of his dreams you know got up the next day and mailed more pamphlets about burma to churches and mission centers in the states then waited if there isnt another movie im going to seriously question the artistic integrity of sylvester stallone,cruel

sylvester stallone director actor and screenwriter gets it right in this is a fastpaced ultraviolent action pic that truly delivers now living in thailand is asked to escort a bunch of dogooders up a river to burma as youd expect their good intentions are rewarded with rape amputation and bayoneted children when a church leader pays a bunch of mercenaries to locate the missing dogooders is enlisted once again as youd expect their narcissistic intentions are rewarded with massive bloodshed gory dismemberment and jungle justice in a nutshell this is a slammin gorefest that is never boring heads are blown clean off human bodies are reduced to geysers of gore in plain english justifies his return stallones performance is smartly low key although we know what hes capable of he has fun making us wait for him to explode the villains are sleazy burmese military bastards with no redeeming qualities their leader even molests young boys when hes not breaking geneva conventions being a big fan of aesthetically beautiful screen violence i was initially skeptical of the promises this films publicity was making im overjoyed to report that the mayhem is gleefully realized and technically accomplished the photography is solid moody and subdued and the films sound design is a winner its the best flick since first blood and it manages to create a certain care factor that was missing from the previous sequels the epilogue which i wont discuss here is an inspired stroke highly recommended,cruel
myself and some of my best friends drove for 1 hour last night to see the last picture from stallone the cinema were full of people everywhere excited to see back in actioni just gotta say damn what a cool movie it just blew up everything i were hoping for it gave me and the crowd in the cinema our money worth when the movie started we could hear the old intro and people started clapping so did we it was one wild ride this movie people killing people like flies and then the action hero of all heroes just comes in and destroys everything in his wayi really loved this this is the best movie since the first one all i can say is if your reading this stallone way to go man youve just raised from the dead and shown to the world that will live forever i really recommend this to all action lovers but be warned some of the scenes even made me almost look the other way but it made the movie stronger 10 out of 10 stars from me and all of my friends,cruel
i just got back from the theater and i can honestly say that this movie rockedthis was the most brutal film ive ever seenthis movie puts saving private ryan and aliens vs predatorrequiem to shamei hate to say thisbut i had a huge smile on my face as killedslaughtered his foesif you see the movie you will understand whyi grew watching and rocky and i cannot tell how glad i am that both franchises have made solid comebackssly stallone is still credible playing the role of john and i felt as if an old friend came back to visiti hope every fan of the series goes out to see this film,cruel
i sat down in the movie theater expecting nothing more than recycled action with up to date effects but i quickly realized i was watching the best movie since transformers it is one of those movies that you just know that youre gonna watch it 140 times and still be entertained i was jumping up and down in my seat  laughing and reacting stallone delivers the goods and then some i havent felt this good watching a movie since i was 10 and saw jurassic park and the violence can put a million horror flicks to shame with the films incomprehensible amount of blood brains and flying limbs i was so impressed that i found nothing negative about the whole movie and it easily pushes in to my top 20 favorite movies ever further more this is the most raw and brutal movie i have ever seen forget saw or hostel is the movie to watch trust me it is a must see masterpiece of an action movie,cruel
this movie was all action very real and is a must see if you dont see this movie you are missing out if you didnt like it sorry for you but i guess you need to stick to the g rated movies it left me saying wow  i cant wait till i see this movie again its like the best ever and i hope that this isnt the end wow wow wow wow a must see wowwow wow wow wowand for those of you who say that this movie is boring i want to know what movie you went to see cause it wasnt this one it made me want more and it proves that sometimes you can do it right a fourth time,cruel
let me start off by saying that this is one of the most violent films i have ever seen what you see in the first part of the film is how absolutely horrible the bad guys in this case the burmese army are the things they do to the men women and children of this little village are so disgusting that it makes you nauseous then comes leaves a whole lot of the army not feeling very good and he does it in an ultraviolent way but after seeing how atrocious these people are you find yourself cheering when they get what is coming to themnow as far as stalone he looks bad really bad he needs to lay of the human growth hormone he look disgusting,cruel
if i enjoy something i give it high marks this was hardcore action terse dialogue and a do or die motto really detailed work on action gore blood how guns really blow apart flesh manthe atrocities felt real and compelling when you see a village destroyed you see everything and you finally know what evil really isthe only thing unbelievable was that christians were trying to help others with my hollywoodliberal education i found that depiction really strange unheard of but if you can get past that inaccurate hollywood depiction of christians because their supposed to be liars sexual deviants self centered weak spirited and manipulators than you will thoroughly enjoy this moviebtw i was being sarcastic this is the first movie to show christians doing what they do missionary work but also helping others and risking their lives and also showing true evil i mean as a history buff there are so many accounts of whole cities villages getting slaughtered by all sides granted but by the sheer volume numbers is what one has to look at and christians above all others the west above all others is by far helping others more than any other govt society religion andor idelologie,cruel
i wanted to see just because it was i honestly expected it to be bad but this is seriously one of the best action movies of all time good lord from the first guys he kills it just gets your heart pumping stallone really really delivers on this dont believe the reviews outside of the action it actually has a compelling story and enemies that you really want to see dead i give it 10 stars because i left the movies not being able to stop smiling im proud of you sly good job i dont really want to give anything away but there is this one part where he gets a mine andwell you really have to see it words dont describe how awesome the action was see it,cruel
hi everybody i will simply say to you is a masterpiecekick ass movie sly like hes past rocks take my advice and watch the movie just give it a try for me i was so excited to this movie for three reasons 1to know what happen for john after all these years2to see john musclessly body shape its rock for hes age3because its john movie so really the movie shows that sly is a genius hes the director and the writer my god he is really rocksreally i hope if he now in 40 of hes age god bless you slyfor me i will rate this movie 1110,cruel
i was pretty skeptic i thought that its not gonna be good but it was stallone did a great job i didnt really thought that its a senior or something even though in some scenes it was pretty weird to see his flattened plastic surgery face and then see his old skin on his arm and chest but it didnt really matterthe story itself isnt a big deal weve seen it several times already but the action scenesholy crap guys i havent seen this kind of graphic explicit shooting for a long time there were some really unique deaths that i havent seen elsewhere there were some pretty nasty scenes as well massmurderits pretty hardcore but hey its a movie there were only 2 big action sequences but those were pretty longmostly the 2nd and final one there were some flashbacks to the earlier s as wellif you liked the trailer youll like the movie as well cause you get what you expect,cruel
first blood is one of my all time favorite action films sure the storys message was more interesting not to mention his domestic war it did also define who and what was i had not heard much about the new and was dazzled with most aspects of the film stallones direction sound music filmed on location and better than average cast of mercenaries and church people in the end success here is defined by action good against evil saving a life s coming to terms with himself and blood gore death and destruction stallone delivered 10 to all his fans old and newid give a pass to those who walked out because the gore was too realistic one could argue the need for it but the barrage of escapist surreal staged violence was like a stallonithon operetta fans take the violence as intended realistically but not seriously i totally enjoyed the excitement of all those moments bravo sylvester is truly backoh my title refers to the nonsensical gripes from reviewers who dislike screen violence escapist action death and destruction and who seemed to believe the extras including kids were actually killed to make the film gd didnt really kill all those kids in their favorite film the ten commandments did heshe,cruel
4 was by far the best film ever made in the history of mankind it exceeds every one of the previous ones by far every frame is perfect the pyrotechnics are bad ass the dialog is sick the sound design is the best so far and the bad guy gets it really good at the end it will make you root for as if you were in kindergarten rooting for the god damn teletubbies if you havent seen it yet please do because i want 4 to be the highest grossing film to date in the known universe it really deserves it frigging rules for those of you who wonder why i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 figure out the gay ass system imdb employs and you will realize that 9 is actually a much higher score fck romantic comedies,cruel
i never go to movies anymore because of the whole downloading thing but i had to go see this when i was a kidtween was pretty damn cool explosive tipped arrows hell yea so i went to see this for old times sake and relive a little youth and it worked i was back wide eyed and cheering for much more bloody than any of the previous but thats what the crowd has to have now so its there only complaint would be the inter struggle always has which i took for granted it seems was not as there and i found that i missed it i also wish they had given a little more info on the burmese issues just so more people would notice the horror that is really going on there anyway by all means go to the movies and see not one moment of this movie was a waste of time every minute was a blast,cruel
i have been a member on the site along time and never felt it necessary to post a comment however after watching this movie i felt i had to in terms of pure entertainment and action this movie is second to none stallone kept it true to the rest of the series but at the same time took it places it has never been before the action will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire 1hr 33min the entire crowd at the theatre was enjoying the movie the whole timedont miss out on this movie stallone put together an instant classic that any or action fan will truly enjoy go today and see the best action movie ever made i also have to say thank you to sylvester stallone for giving my family one more great movie to enjoy,cruel
this movie glorifies war killing and portrays asians as savage brutes sylvester stallone you need to get your head out your ass and realize that brute force doesnt work anymore look at iraq did the war end after the bombing rampage  no lame people we need to use our intelligence to end these warsfind the root of the problem end the greed i imagine if there were other intelligent beings sharing our space  time they must think were idiots serious we have the technologies to end poverty war and suffering throughout the world but because of greed and stupidity we remain perpetuating our ignorant past is a dumb movie theres nothing of significance in this movie,cruel
first things first  is by no means a perfect ten film the reason im giving this a fullstar rating is because in comparison to other films of its genre and taking into consideration its aim as a film it really succeeds on all levels its fun its entertaining its brutal and its way better than the last two films in the seriesfortunately sylvester stallone approached john or as it was retitled and which im not too keen on to be honest with a fresh mindset he had been developing the script a while but unlike rocky balboa is a fairly outdated franchise on almost all levels rocky is still respected by many people on an overall basis and he holds an everyman appeal as a character its not just a family film franchise that appeals to viewers of all ages its something that speaks to people for a number of reasonsdoesnt have that legacy hes not an everyman hes not a symbol of hope and cando spirit and selfempowerment nobody was really sitting there biting their nails waiting for another movie sly had a hard time finding distributors and made his own trailers to show off for potential investors it was finally picked up in 2007 and the online fanbase of 80s action flicks cheered in victory but most people i met in real life guffawed at the thought of another its easy to mock stallone for apparently trying to resurrect the only two characters hes remembered for and i really couldnt have cared less about another film since i only liked first blood and thought the other two were pure rubbish but as soon as i saw rocky balboa and read comments by stallone about his script afterward i became immediately interested in how he was going to approach this filmfirst of all the action is wellstaged people keep talking about the 3deathsperminute average  but really most of that is in the last 15 minutes during which a number of people arent even killed by there are dozens of soldiers fighting and its really no different than an average largescale battle sequence does kill plenty of people of course  but hardly as many as in the other two sequels or at least not quite as exaggeratedly the action is far more realistic here than any of the previous sequels is still of course fairly superhuman but thanks to solid direction and gritty cinematography it feels very realistic its guerilla filmmaking on par with the original that the other sequels completely lackedbecame such a symbol by 1988 that it was really all about stallone flexing not so much here is downtrodden and worldweary and subdued again  much like the original character in first blood was presented one thing i have to admit i hoped for more of was character development sly seemed to keep communicating how intent he was on getting behind the psyche of the character but most of it is very much surfacevalue stuff and the character still comes across as kind of stiff and wooden slys very smart and articulate off screen but hes always had trouble with dialogue and suffers here as much as rocky balboa did in the same department luckily doesnt talk much but some of the early scenes between him and julie benz teeter on the edge of cheesiness it doesnt help that benzs role is underwritten i got the sense that many additional scenes were either trimmed down before filming or deleted in postproduction there simply isnt enough room to expand the relationship which is a shame because it needs an expansion to really work as well as it should have i will say though that it was refreshing to see stallone avoid a romantic subplot  that would have completely pushed it over the edge into clichd sentimentality he avoids that which i give him credit fori dont quite buy into the whole politicalsocial commentary about burmese brutality that sly keeps pushing in interviews but it does provide an interesting backdrop that gives the film an additional sense of realism that the others lacked the action sequences are all staged very well and theres no excessive cgi or quickcuts or michael baystyle editing  its very much oldfashioned upclose nittygritty action with real stuntmen and real special effects the gore is as realistic as saving private ryan which kind of shocked me at first since the other sequels were so goofy and overthetop but the film definitely benefits from this realismoverall i was entirely entertained by the movie it doesnt exceed expectations by a long shot  the character development as i mentioned above could have used a bit more work and certain areas like rocky balboa come off as trying a bit too hard  yet its still way better than it could have been and i dont buy into the critics complaining about the excess of violence it isnt exploitative or overly brutal its a hard action film its rated r if you dont want to see people getting shot and blown up you shouldnt be watching a movie to begin with but for what its worth this is the most intelligent and realistic film since first blood  and i honestly wouldnt mind seeing a 5 as stallone says hes currently penning if he approaches it the same way i hope his rejuvenated career doesnt cause investors to throw too much money at him and have him start overusing cgi etc  the thing this film benefits from the most is its oldschool backtobasics style i really enjoyed the movie and was pleasantly surprised that someone out there is still capable of making an oldfashioned 1970sstyle action film without all the silly camp that came with the 80s,cruel
first blood and are films ii and iii are entertainment in stallone finally brings his character full circle in he is at least 60 years old but it seems hard to pin down the exact date of action in yet he is capable of extraordinary feats using the pistol on the boat is a great example i know green berets his age that could do that the compound bow is intriguing it appears to be the same one as in iii but there is no indication that the equipment survived how could the bow but not the other iconic accoutrements have been retained also what happened to the knives used in the second and third movies i cant imagine the character discarding those weapons presumably forged the third knife himself i believe this scene was cut from iii one of the deleted scenes from iii shows him retrieving weapons and making the knife for his mission to rescue trautman the scene also shows his dress uniform  ive been trying to get my father who is an exgreen beret that is s age to interpret it for me i have no idea how this equipment could have been conceivably retained the machete creation scene could have been replaced with retrieving the iii bowie knife employing this as part of his preparation for killing might have made a stronger presentation the middle of the film the flashback sequence is brilliant with this one can ignore the second and third movies if you watch first blood and then you understand stallones not david morrells original or the ones from his movie tiein novels the end of parallels the beginning of first blood being from arizona i can certainly envision the ranch he arrives at it is a fantastic visual image and setting  probably pretty close to reality bowie az is just east of tuscon ii indicated that he was of indiangerman descent interestingly the books suggest that had a navajo background but they are in northern arizona theres no sleeping bag over his shoulder at the end of theres the m65 field jacket of course the blue jeans and an army duffel with jstenciled on it all of s experiences maybe even some equipment and gear remnants of his past are metaphorically contained in his bag it would be a fantastic speculation to guess what is in the duffel walks down the long road not to action and trouble as in first blood or off to vietnam but to unpack his past bowie az is certainly a quiet little town and maybe even boring s war is over and he finally came full circle,cruel
john is retired in southeast asia when a church group approaches him to get a boat ride into burma he refuses calling it a war zone but with a little persuading he agrees this may have been a mistake because he spends the rest of the film trying to save the group he took into burma many of whom probably didnt make it very far alivei was very excited for this film for a long time the first three movies are all awesome i figured this one would be too especially taking place in burma which ended up in the news about the time of the films release this played in the movies favor since they were able to add a few minutes of actual news footage to the beginning of this one that just might be the best part of the filmi didnt like the preachiness and moral ambiguity presented the church group spouts off how they have to save people and it seemed so forced as if they were really trying to convince the audience and not but it was so thick and then the moral ambiguity one group completely opposed to killing while massacres people wholesale and no lesson is learned by anyone is killing moral is it moral at least sometimes what is a justifiable level of violence this is not tackled at all even though we can guess that no violence is too little and s extreme violence is overkilli loved the intense gore  arms and legs blown off and people shot at close range it looked awesome and brought the idea of war home however i absolutely hate sylvester stallones directing the violence was very much computergenerated something that we did just fine without in the first three films wheres the squibs why make a cartoon and how come every time action starts the scene has to move in fastforward and seem more like a bad collage than an actual fluid event stallone please do not direct movies just act in movie where you shoot and punch people pleaseif you liked the first three films you ought to see this one though you might be disappointed then again you might not be my loving friends really enjoyed this movie so you might be like them i havent heard anyone say they absolutely hated the film so youre likely to at least appreciate it a little check it out,cruel
the fourth movie has been a long time coming  20 years  and is the first one to be directed by stallone himself like rocky balboa 2006 this is a surprising return to form for sly  and in this case emerges as perhaps the best in the serieseven so the storyline is pretty thin  is hired to free a group of doctors taken prisoners in the wartorn jungles of burma  and the film atypically short for contemporary fare the end credits start rolling around the 80minute mark however stallone makes up for these with a thoroughly unflinching portrayal of the cruelty and gruesomeness of war  which instead of a modern hollywood blockbuster brings to mind those objectionable italianmade jungle adventures or even the notorious video nasties of the 1980s as a result it would be interesting to see how the previous entries in the series stack up against this noholdsbarred bloodthirsty update but alas presently i dont have enough time on my hands to find out what is certain however is that stallones planet hollywood pals  arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis  must be gnashing their teeth in envyas unequivocally proves here that he truly is the last action hero incidentally one is never really sure why the atrocities on the burmese villagers are being perpetrated and on whose orders which if one isnt bothered to come up with the expected metaphors rather makes the relentless display of carnage throughout seem somewhat pointless and altogether less than entertaining  despite the familiar strains of jerry goldsmiths stirring theme ps by the way the print i watched sported the john title which bafflingly was shortened for the us  as it would have tied in well with rocky balboa itself,cruel
i have used imdb for a while now without registering i saw this film last night and felt compelled to right a review of it because this is what action film used to be like i knew i would like this film because i loved the other movies but this is totally different its grittier and a lot more violent also the used of cgi is kept to a bare minimum also i cant believe sly is running around the jungle at his age he looks half his age and i would absolutely love it if he made 5 but this is probably unlikely brilliant brilliant brilliant i loved it as another imdb user said this movie reeks of awesomeness well directed too and for once the story line is slightly believable sly we salute you,cruel
this fourth installment of was superb in comparison with the other films coming into the theater i knew that i would be expecting massive explosions and machine guns but the plot of the movie was very well put together this is one of the few action movies where i grew to hate the bad guys the bad guys in this movie are so brutal that it makes you wish just destroy them also this movie was very gory parts of the action sequences feels like you are watching saving private ryan sylvester stallone delivers yet again i thought that he wouldnt stand a chance in keeping up with his latest movie rocky balboa but he sure does deliver in this film if you are a fan of action movies then tops the list of action packed movies 910,cruel
is the movie that i have always wanted to see someone sly finally had the balls to make it whilst blowing 50 to 60 brains out at the same time much like john needs certain things before he marches into burma a few things are required from you as well first you must a have a brain so that it can get properly blown out of the back of your head second you must have a set a balls so that they to can get blown of your midsection third and last you must have a deep appreciation for movies you must appreciate how ridiculous they are and how they are able to shape you life as a child and as an adult i have not had this much pleasure in a movie since die hard or well 2,cruel
one of the best action movies ever its anti militaristic aspect gives another level to the film presenting the true face of war and its consequences definitely achieved to maintain the title of the antihero model of our generation despite the fact that the movie leaves you with the anticipation of another half an hour at least it poses as a complete action film as ever along with the first blood john is one of the most realistic and rawcontent movies of the kind giving out the disturbing reality such as the war veterans discrimination and the genocide taking place in berman that hasnt taken the publicity it needs,cruel
i just seen and there was all of 8 people in there while juno had a full house that is injustice on the highest level indeedall i will say is that is back and he will kick your ass through the screen and leave you bleeding and with bruises i havent had my ass kicked this hard by a movie in a while there was a bit of gore but they have modern technology now and its for him to kick ass and have no gore would be unrealistic and this movie was certainly realistic i predict note the uppercase letters there is no other way to say it will be the most bad ass movie of 08 by far see this movie periodps stallone wowed me as some1 said in another review he truly is the king of action movies,cruel
they dont make them like this anymore the presence of john is huge and the audience loved every minute of it the timing of action scenes the limited dialogue work perfectly and the audience cheered for it its rare now a days to see this happen i cant get over how well crafted and detailed the action scenes were done can i just say wow thats the feeling i felt leaving the theatre stallone brought back the original formula that made the first two movies a success after seeing this i hope there will be another but if there isntits a fantastic end to the series thanks stallone for restoring my faith in the action movie,cruel
what can i say my hat goes off to you sly to make this movie just after rocky balboa is a incredible ok now to the movie i hate when people go looking for more than they should be it is what it isa movie the directing  editing in this movie is second to none you truly couldnt keep your eyes off the screen i have never seen action sequences quite like this at no point in the movie did i think that the violence was too much if you dont like action movies or violence why would you ever go see the script is what you would expect from there were a lot of one liners and male bravado but this is critical for the movies success i thought the casting overall was pretty good and you ended up caring for the characters i applaud sly for bringing our attention to the misdoings in burma what is happening over there is purely barbaric and its truly unbelievable this violence around the world needs to stop in conclusion if this movie is your kind if thing go see it you wont be disappointed if your intrigued by the whole burma aspect also goes see it i believe there is a great true story to be told here even if hundreds of people were slaughtered along the way,cruel
1 this movie is only 1 hr and 20mins long finding nemo was longer lol 2 there is no plot whatsoever 3 proof of life  thats is a hostage  mercenary movie  4000 was a direct ripoff of thathostel and the unit all put together 4 can someone fill me in on the date the us military started using small nukes in claymores that scene was worse then when he carried 2 m60s in each hand there was a mushroom cloud for god sakes5 i cant believe none of the mercenarys died figured stallone would take all the glory 6 maybe im old or just more mature but was there a need that every 2 minutes someone either had to explode get raped burn alive or worse 7 i added it up the total time of slys spoken words was 22 mins guess they were worried wed confuse the accent with rocky 8 anyone that thinks this movie will somehow spread light on the burma problems and help is too much like rocky and has been hit the head way to much 9 if youre under 30 and have no problem with movies where a cop shoots 18 rounds out of a six shooter you will like this film if you like at least 50 accuracy and realism you wont 10 originals were unrealistic yes but they served a purpose for the cold war antics some of lived through if youre under 24 i dont expect you to understand why this movie cant compare 11 i wont ruin the end with and the boss but i will say youre kidding me ive fought tougher boss battles in super mario brosanyways yes this movie stunk in my honest opinion i know some of you wont agree but thats why fought in nam so i could say my opinionlisten the movie is horribly violent and unfortunately heads exploding zombies and robotsmonster cgi is what rules the screens these days but if anyone thinks this movie is worth the credit i keep seeing then you my friend are in the 12 to 18 age group and therefore shouldnt be watching it anywayslast rocky  inspiring and nicely done last  tiring and puts sly back in the gutter of fame,cruel
its the most boring movie  i have ever seen its a good thing that rocky was released before or i would have missed a good moviei mean whats to like i this movie just try and relate it to reality and you will see that mercenaries had no business in other countries we have un what the hell was aid society doing trying to cross borders illegally and causing military actionsand then helping the mercenaries i dont think religion and war should be mixed in this way russiaus and afghanistan was a good mix in earlier this is just boring and just too tiring to watch,cruel
i came to this movie expecting to see action and lots of it i was expecting violence at least every 5 minutes what i got was a lot of staring and maybe a half hour total of actionlet me review the plot people die stare stare stare at snakes stare stare at people fighting snakes stare stare stare stare stare at christian group stare stare stare at the darkness stare at lights stare at pirates shoot pirates stare stare stare burn up boat stare at burning boat stare stare at mercenaries stare stare shoot some people with your bow stare stare sneak around a camp without killing anybody stare blow up an old bomb stare shoot some people with a machine gun stab a guy stare walkexaggeration i wish,cruel
of course laughing out loud would be good if this was a comedy but it isnt if somebody made a parody of weird al yankovich in the movie uhfs parody of it would look exactly like thisthe plot is basic the acting is not great but by george they sure do blow a heck of a lot of stuff up and they shoot about 1000 people and blow them to bits with 16 different types of weapons and you get to see all of it in graphic detail so i guess if that is what you are after then this is the movie for you if you actually like acting and plot in a movie go see anything elsei am stunned that this movie is rated so high on this site at 77 stars at the time of my writing this,cruel
im usually not inspired to sit down and write a review of a film ive seen unless its so bad that i just have to get some aggression out but i just had to write something to explain how happy i am after seeing dont get me wrong im not happy about the atrocities presented in the film or the situation in burma which are all too real i just havent experienced and i believe thats the right wording you dont see this film you experience it a feeling like this at the movies in a very long timewhen this film was over i wanted to find sylvester stallone and thank him i wanted to thank him for being at the top of his game and delivering a truly visceral experience rather than just phoning it in which is what he couldve done all too easilysimply put this is a great action film maybe one of the best ever i know that reaction could be chalked up to having just seen it but i honestly cant remember the last time i had this much adrenaline running through me after seeing a movie when it was over and i know that this is a very overused analogy i felt exactly how i feel after getting off of a roller coaster i was jittery and pumped and i wanted to experience it again instantlyeveryone else has pretty much outlined the plot missonaries go up river to deliver medical attention get kidnapped and has to save them so it would seem redundant to repeat it here instead ill say that the direction the editing and the technical expertise of this film are outstanding this isnt a paint by numbers kind of action film stallone seems to have truly wanted to deliver something different to the audience and he has succeeded admirablyand by the way those reports by other posters of people cheering and clapping and yelling in the parking lot of the movie theater are not fabrication the exact same thing happened when i saw it tonightgreat job sly i hope its a big fat number one hit for you,cruel
this movie is an absolute masterpiece an instant classic i went in expecting it to be good but i never expected it to be this good it left me speechlessand my god what savagery i even saw one girl run out of the movie theater holding back vomit on two separate occasions during the movieit received a standing ovation from over half the audience in a theater packed to capacitynow having personally spent over a month in the country of burma where the movie takes place i would like to say that this movie is a fairly accurate representation of burma in many ways it is a very good reminder about the kinds of horrible things that go on in burma that most of us dont know about and our government chooses to ignore mostly because china supports them and backs them upmany people in the world dont even know burma exists let alone whats going on over there i would like to thank stallone and everyone else involved in this movie for helping to put a spotlight on that country and its governmenti highly highly recommend this movie it deserves your moneykyle,cruel
this is one of if not the best movie i have ever seen i loved all the other films and this one just topped them all stallone at his all time best if you love action hardcore gunfighting and a hell of a lot of explosions this is the film for you i give a 10 out of 10 for pure action adrenaline and some of the best acting by a rather unknown cast this is a must see film if you leave the theater unsatisfied you must be deadfrom start to finish this movie grips you and engulfs you in the action stallone is and will always be this is a movie you dont want to miss this film will get your heart pumping and your blood boiling go out and watch this incredible film you will not leave the theater unsatisfied,cruel
this was a truly awful movie it shows why actors shouldnt be allowed to produce or direct the previous movies had a message that we had badly used the men we sent to vietnam something i think we all agree on now but what is the point of this one that burmamyanmar have evil rulers yeah i guess we can agree on that the plot or should i say the excuse to hang the action scenes on is that is hired to take missionaries into burma after saying it is an incredibly stupid idea he is talked into it by the hot blond babe who has a totally unconvincing argument after an encounter with river pirates leaves the missionaries at a village where the bad guys blow them up and capture the survivorsthen takes a bunch of cartoonish mercenaries up the river where more actions scenes ensue i guess they like the cgi entrails they are able to add into the film like that makes the action scenes cooler ill say it again  cgi is not a substitute for story and character development the villains the burmese army are portrayed as rapists and murderers they imply that the army leader is gay since he takes a young man into his hut and the boy leaves crying the next morning yeah thatll appeal to the homophobic demographics that watches these movies more action scenes more cgi entrails popping out ho hum boringdecides to go back to arizona after the film ends we never really know whyavoid this movie like the plague,cruel
got free passes to see the new figured it might be good for a laugh and a little excitement got an hour into it before walking out all this stuff youve been hearing about nonstop violent action is complete horseshit i can honestly say what i saw of the film was mindnumbingly boring the first hour moves at a snails pace i swear i am not joking the violent scenes i saw happened so quick you could barely even tell what had just happened blink and youll miss a cheaplooking cgi effect of some guys head being blown off to say the new is nothing more than a copycat movie is putting it mildly youve seen s bythenumbers premise executed dozens of times before with far more entertaining results the first half hour blatantly steals from apocalypse nows going upriver on a boat theme and the actionwar sequences strive for saving private ryans gritty realism  but fall considerably short due to the films obvious budgetary constraints theres also a scene where rips out a guys trachea just like in roadhouse this film tries so hard to rip off other movies that have come out since 1988s iii it has the odd distinction of being a sequel that has very little in common with the previous films in the series you almost get the impression stallone secretly wishes they never existed given the fact the last film had the title character join forces with the taliban i cant say i blame himso glad i didnt waste a nickel to see this idiotic piece of garbage the dialogue and acting are atrocious the onedimensional stereotypes passing as characters in the film consist of good american bad asians annoying brit and naive woman the bad guys are the personification of evil  but luckily for  still dumb enough to keep the americans they abduct in bamboo cages so they can be rescued easily the slow moving first hour felt like an eternity consisting solely of setting up the clichd nonexistent plot which is nothing more than a variation on the ii premise and countless other action movies that came out in the 80s good god what a horrible piece of crap stallone has made yet another forgettable unwatchable turd to add to his already lengthy and unparalleled list of cinematic turkeys this probably ranks on the suckometer somewhere between rhinestone and staying alive and what happened to the explosivetipped arrows that can blow up a tank from ramblow ii and iii who knew that one man could wipe out entire armies with a bow and arrow and if s been living a life of solitude out in the jungle for so many years wheres the nearest gym for him to get those bulging forearmsill never watch a stallone film again i should have learned my lesson 10 years ago when i stormed out of the boring and pointless copland i remember back then stallones fans tried generating best actor oscar buzz for that now the pied piper of cinema has rallied the troops to try getting this smelly piece of manure on the imdb top 250 its not going to work my advice save your money and stop rewarding this second rate movie maker and socalled actor for continuously churning out unwatchable crap i have nothing against mindless action movies but this is a moronic exploitation film posturing as geopolitical commentary its offensive to all five senses,cruel
as i was sitting in my seat before the fourth installment in the series i was not in high spirits or filled with any hint of great expectations boy was i wrong this film brought the best qualities in any action movie together does this movie contain a lot of gore and violence yes is it senseless and over the top no to my surprise this movie had more carnage than any id ever seen before that i can recall but i was not disgusted or upset by it this was realistic violence it didnt try and censor or hide what would actually happen when certain events took place normally in a movie with s level of violence i would simply roll my eyes and think here we go again stupid unnecessary gore however sylvester stallone knew what he was doing its comparable to saving private ryan in being realistic but probably even a little more grisly sylvester stallone was completely bada in his acting he did a great job as old as he is so as a huge stallone fan i was very pleased overall this was one of the most if not the most fastpaced exciting realistic and enjoyable actionthrillers i have ever seen and the plot was pretty darn good too the only reason i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because it was a tad bit short and i just wished it was longer but by no means did the shortness take away from the storyline or movie in general its definitely a movie i would pay another 800 to see again on a final note the ending is very heartwarming and uplifting the final movie of the series is great in nearly every way go see it as soon as you can,cruel
stallones attempt to give a final go went blazing berserk it seems to have gunned down everything on screen and might have just might have taken the audience down as well the prospect of what a final and a rocky movie could be has always been a dream for the audience i guess so expectations were always high stallone punched spot on for rocky but seems to have missed the target with with a touch too much violence but one would also ask if not this then what else afterall is and has always been a one man army a killing machine forged in vietnam this movie certainly makes that point more than clear in burma also making an attempt to bring out the injustice happening there coz of the civil war one notable difference in this movie is his indifference to his feelings for his home country and his rise as a messiah for humanity itself i guess internet caught up with too bluring boundaries hes developed a soft corner for julie benzs character too imagine a softyphewmuscle maniac who can be mellow inside too this movie doesnt show in captivity and him escaping from it and saving others in the process it concentrates just on saving others he is never caught or torturedbut once again stallone has pulled that look marvellously in fact 50 plus looks even more a rugged soldier i guess when was younger he had to look a bit cute however savage for the female fansand come on the guy is a looker 4 is all muscles yes but the eyes store something much more deeper something much more scarier his face is like a trees trunk it has a story a savage one so the makeup team did really good and stallone now a veteran actor adds on to their effort with a stone face radiating with tons of deep but intangible emotion all this stallone achieves without having to visibly move any of his cheek muscles mark of a great actor i guess the direction well if you are gonna judge by the number of bad guys getting their butts obliterated well this one scores the highest points if violence agrees with you dont miss this movie its got a bullet for every minute,cruel
thank you sylvester stallonethank you for keeping the action genre alive in a time where most of the more action packed movies are taken over by cgi shaky camera girliemen sissy boys and in general total boredom and lack of anything positive its a great relief that at least one guy is faithful to the genre is a gritty tough brutal and quite hardcore piece of action movie that gives the fans what theyve been waiting for it good vs evil its men its guns its explosions its gore its bad guys getting massacred in huge numbers its the return of the real action movie its a masterpiece very few people could pull this off in the times we live in but sly couldthank you sylvester stallone,cruel
establishes a new world record of limbs flying around with an average of 259 killings per minute of which some are also innocent civilians such as women and children this has got to be one of the most violent movies ever made but its not just the quantity thats amazing but also the quality of it all getting an arrow through your head apparently isnt enough you also need to feel atop of a mine that has to explode obviously is not a recommendable movie just to everyoneit actually makes quite sense though that this fourth movie installment is so incredibly violent you have to remember that the first movie first blood from 1982 was quite renewing and violent for its time as the series progressed with first blood part ii and iii the movie became more and more violent and actually daring for its time they could had decided to do in the same style as its predecessors which probably would had gotten them a good movie as well but instead they decided to keep pushing the envelope and see how far they could go now in the 21th century with its gore and violence always had been a trend setter for action movies and with the fourth movie it continues to do sohard to say what it is that makes such a surprisingly fine movie perhaps because it shows balls and this movie is basically one big testosterone driven action flick that will keep your adrenaline pumping throughout it foremost is a real man movie and i cant imaging too many women enjoying this moviebut its also a movie of a great quality the cinematography by glen macpherson gives the movie a gritty but beautiful look but of course its mostly the action that impresses its extremely violent but its also done extremely well bodies and limbs are flying through the air limbs are being shot and cut off and the movie features more exploding heads than several zombie movie flicks combined the movie obviously has some professional stuntwork and pyrotechnicsspecial effectsof course when you start analyzing the movie it simply is a very poor one with a very formulaic but also almost nonexistent and developed story its just a movie you have to experience this of course goes for most action movies but for this one even more than others i just have a thing for overthetop going movies the movies are all an example of this as well as the rocky series which also stars sylvester stallone in the main leaddespite the fact that he already was well over 60 years old already at the time of shooting this movie sylvester stallone is still convincing enough in his role of the iconic action hero as the tag line says heroes never die they just reload besides playing the title role stallone also directed the movie making this the first movie that he directed i think that the movie deliberately didnt cast any other big names in it in order to put the emphasis mainly on stallone and his character this is the way it also should be in my opinion when you have a movie with a character such as in it you basically dont need any other interesting characters anymore yes it would had been great if col trautman also had been in the movie who always had been sort of s conscience but he isnt missed as much as some people would had expected and feared really of course the reason why he doesnt appear in this movie is because the actor richard crenna who played the character in all of the previous movies passed away in 2003jerry goldsmith the composer of all of the previous movies had also passed away in 2004 his replacement for this movie is brian tyler whos expertize is the action genre he however did not forget goldsmiths previous scores for the movies which means that this movie features a lot of reprising themes besides its new original compositionsprobably the most extreme and violent action movie youll ever see clearly not a movie for just everyone but i really liked and appreciated the movie for what it did to raise the bar again within the action genre just like the previous movies had done before in the 80s and 90s810httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,cruel

we are accustomed to seeing action movies where the hero though cunning and skill defeats impossible odds to save the day while not the first in this genre john sylvester stallone is an action icon of sorts due the series of movies that took him everywhere from a small town in the pacific northwest vietnam and afganistan now with this latest and last movie we find back in the jungles except this time he will fight for humanitarian reasonsis living a life of isolation and self hatred in thailand where he spends his days hunting cobras and other snakes when he is not hunting cobras for money he uses his old boat to move up and down the local rivers where he has become something of an expert in terms of navigation the existence is menial and hard but it is enough to help escape the ghosts of his pasthowever a group of well meaning but innocent american missionaries decide to ask for help in order to smuggle them into myanmar burmas real name michael paul schulze is the typical well intentioned but perhaps ignorant american who believes that good intentions alone and medicine will solve the worlds problems his friend and teammate sarah julie benz is perhaps even more ignorant but just as caring even though we have to question if she really knows what she is getting herself into of course knowing the ways of the real world can only think that michael sarah and the other missionaries are waisting their time but he agrees to help after a motivational speech by sarah that appeals to his inner goodness perhaps after all he does still have some humanity left in himas expected michael sarah and the rest of the team are caught up in the fighting when a local warlord attacks the village they have come to help this begs the question as to why michael who supposedly had been to myanmar five times before would be so foolish as to allow his team to be so easily caught in a village that would obviously be a target despite this rather small plot hole we witness the entire village massacred in a graphic scene that includes rape men being shot in cold blood and women shot down as the run another day in myanmar we are expected to believefinds all of this out through the pastor of the missionariess church in a rather ironic turn at least in regards to michaels earlier pious wailing on the evil of violence this pastor has hired a group of mercenaries to rescue the team and he is asking to transport them up river of course remembering sarahs words on helping people decides to take themthe rest of the movie is a violent expose on how hollywood can now realistically portray violence there is no point in going into details since we know that will of course rescue most of the missionaries and lead the band of mercenaries to victory the warlords troops will die violent deaths and the movie will climax with something blowing up and killing more people the good guys of course will win and then everyone will go home including himself who decides to return to the small farm or ranch that his father owns in the united statesviolent and silly is at least good entertainment if one enjoys mindless violence and blood if were as easy as portrays then perhaps all the world really needs is a few guys with sensitive hearts who know how to kill the bad guys710,cruel
i remember watching the first film and thinking about how awesome it was it had its share of gore violence and the like but it didnt hit as hard as the 2nd which delivered more violence but to a lesser extreme but almost 20 years later after 3 which ive heard was bad a new comes out and thanks to computer graphics sylvester stallones imagination and the cruelty of the world this movie is just excellence all the blood splashing waylives his life as a farmer in thailand he lives in peace until one day a group of missionaries from a church in colorado ask him to take them upriver to wartorn burma the leader of the missionaries claims he knows what to expect but tells him better of what to expect the missionaries go anyways and end up being capturednow i usually wont do this but there are a few things that must be said about this movie for one its gory beyond your wildest nightmares unless you have no soul or heart youll be begging for the movie to end another thing is you wont just feel a single emotion from this filmyou will feel every emotion there is to feel sadness fear excitement everythingif you like gory details heres a few memorable scenes to watch out forseveral people are shot the bullet holes are the size of bowling ballschildren are held down and shot by soldiersin the pirate scene literally blasts the brains out of the pirates headswomen have their arms dismemberedslices a mans neck openuses a turret gun and rips a mans torso apart with itin the same scene also blasts a mans leg offone man is literally blown to pieces by a mortarthe sniper shoots a guy in the head blasting it to bitsin the camp rescue scene a dancer is stripped of her top and just for a moment you can see her breasts then later she is gang rapeda pig eats the leg of a dead mancuts the head off of an executioner trivia in the internet preview it actually looks like punched the mans head off because the quality of the preview was bad and there are several scenes of people being torturedi thought this movie wouldnt be as bad as it was but trust me you might want to have a barf bag ready when you see this because it is going to make you puke up your popcorn because its so damn goryand just to note if you liked 300 you have to watch thisbottom line of all the 80s movies remakes lately from rocky to indiana jones this one is certainly bound to be best10 out of 10,cruel
its been 20 years that john sylvester stallone is been living in northern thailand as a snake handler when a group of christian missionaries led by julie benz and paul schulze asks to bring them in burma where the poor villagers both adults and childrens have been brutally killed and raped by a ruthless nationalist army soldiers control by major pa tee tint maung maung khin when brings the aid workers in a longboat and returning back home the aid workers have been kidnapped and some are viciously killed along with most of the villagers by major pa tee tint and his men when heard the news he been hired to bring professional mercenaries to rescue the christian missionaries before they are killed but these mercenaries are not as experience or good as to john j directed by sylvester stallone rocky balboa made an intense actionadventurethriller that is somewhat different to the original series which it was very popular action series in the 1980s stallones character is closer to the spirit of the first film first blood and some of the wild action sequences of the sequels but this new is actually much more realistic towards the violence in this one which is quite disturbing and tough to watch to be entertained at times even some of diehard fans will be surprised at thisthe twodisc set of dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen 2351 transfer and an strong dolby digital 51 ex surround sound dvd also included an interesting audio commentary by the director seven featurettes deleted scenes and previews the second disc includes an digital copy of the movie but it didnt quite work in my computer sadly if u enjoy special features you should get the twodisc edition if not just get the single disc of the widescreen edition i was a bit disappointed when i seen at the big screen at first i thought the movie was way too violent to be enjoyed but i felt the movie played better during the second viewingbut the script by stallone and art monterastelli buried alive the hunted have its problems at times while the pacing of the feature is fast it feels too short as well especially when the movie plays for 80 minutes and then over 11 minutes worth of end credits i was glad stallone kept his character quiet most of the time and hes also quite good at staging action sequences theres a few silly stuff to be sure when its intentional or not but character certainly aged well over the years certainly filmmaking has changed over the years the look of the movie is very different from the previous three theres some obviously cgi blood and guts but stallone as a cowriteractor and filmmaker kept the film moving bmovie screenwriter kevin bernhardt was also one of the writers of this feature but hes not credited music composer brian tyler avpralien vs predatorrequiem bubba hotep frality does an fine score here and as well giving tribute to the late oscarwinning composerjerry goldsmith alien gremlins the omen which goldsmith did the music of the original movies this new is not for the squeamish super 35  12 out of ,cruel
when i had first seen i was expecting lots of action and it had a ton so far was the best action movie of 2008 i thought that the action was very graphic and hard to watch at some parts the thing that was very shocking to me is that some of this stuff is really happening in different countries i strongly advise that kids should not see this movie because of the very graphic action scenes sylvester stallone did a great job playing john again when i had seen this i didnt see the first bloods or any of the old movies so i couldnt compare the old ones to the new one i thought that the story was great as well the acting was also surprisingly really good the direction it was going was very good about never giving up and fighting until you have nothing left the movie was even better because john didnt fight everyone and go into the war zone on his own he went with mercenaries all the men were very tough and not afraid of death which was awesome some of the visual effects in it were good as well overall i think that this was a great movie and will go under my favorite action movies of all time so if you want some graphic action than this is a perfect movie for you,cruel
on oscar night i went to see john a movie that wont win any academy awards but is still in the race for some other awards see belowbefore i went in i knew what to expect 15 hour of counting bullets guts decapitated heads chopped off limbs and gallons of blood and thats what i goti must admit that the violence in the beginning of the movie when murderous rebels exterminate a complete village isnt the sort of violence youd love to see mothers fathers kids and dogs are wiped out in such a realistic and hereby horrific way that the images wont be wiped out of your memory for a long time sadly its only present harsh reality so far for the social comments on the events taking place in burma right now its time for john to finish off the bad guys and rescue some western social helpers they thought they were gonna make a change but ended up being captivated by the burmarebels half a dozen of army men come to the rescue and hire as their boatman to lead the way he isnt allowed to join their mission though surprise surprise johnny shows up anyhow and saves the day who needs a half dirty dozen when you got john a onemanarmy like i said in the beginning of the movie the violence is tough and unpleasant because of all the innocent people being killed however the violence wont even out in the rest of the movie from the time jr begins to join the action the violence begins to get very enjoyable indeed something to think about its the difference between abomination and justification john does what he does best handling snipers throwing grenades shooting lots of bullets and showing his immense muscles every time he can too bad it didnt took him longer to fight this warthe picture is very well shot at times very dark and grayish which captures the feeling of a troubled country in war other times it is the beauty of nature that leads to this great contradiction that cinematographically is done very well its this and the incomprehensible way the violence is brought to the screen that makes for a well done movie john in top form if youre a fan of the man youll definitely like what you see really i wonder if guinness book of records is gonna rate this movie as most violence in a movie ever period and win a deserved award after all,cruel
in an industry clogged up with sorry multimedia cash ins neutered to guarantee widespread commercial success with the 1317 year old masses 2008 breaths fresh yet nostalgically familiar air into a system which in recent years has all but abandoned actions films in favor of recyclable light shows for the playstation generation whereas many recent action films the matrix series die hard 40 bourne mi3 etc have relied on an overuse of cgi mtv editing and what can only be described as shaky camera sylvester stallone has nixed this style in favor of returning to the old school aesthetics and indeed ethics of the 1980s action filmthe film is undeniably a throwback to days gone by when action films were exactly that  scenes of violence pieced together by a flimsy patriotic story held together by cartoonish characters who ooze absurd amounts of testosterone whilst undeniably harks back to 80s action films the film has updated the bloodletting for the postsaw generation of film goers whereas first blood part ii displayed as a killing machine mowing down hundreds of vietcon troops displays stallone mowing down hundreds of burmese solders albeit with a lot of bloody gratuitous violence this as mentioned earlier makes for a familiar yet all too refreshing change from the commercially friendly action films thus far of the 00s whilst most action films this millennium have relied on fast cuts montage and cut aways to seemingly suggest violence and receive a lower classification rating goes ballsout to display it in a gloriously exploitative manor much akin to the tortureporn aesthetic of so called horror films as of latewhere bruce willis failed to produce what he promised would be kick ass old school action for die hard 40 stallone has succeeded in successfully updating this formula for a generation of movie goers who long for the action films of yesteryear yet expect the bloodletting of recent titles such as hostelwhilst i dont believe itll happen i certainly hope the films success at the us box office will convince producers to repeat the updated 80s action aesthetic stallone has carved with this filmno more flashy filter filled shaky films please bring on the second coming of the 80s action film,cruel
theres not an ounce of fat on even the title has been trimmed down to the bare essentials and just like the old school action films of the 80s theres a great feeling of get in do the job and get outi had a blast watching the fourth film which delivers exactly what it promised and never drags stallone is in great shape as john and his thousand yard stare still works beautifully for living in isolation is never an option and once again his talents and knowledge or sought out except this time he has to simply escort a group of missionaries into burma rather than go on a mission single handedwith the film always knows its limits and works brilliantly within them the early dialogue scenes are stilted but this is solved by giving fewer lines that ever and letting his eyes do the talking its a credit to the film that we know the character so well that dialogue isnt needed for us to understand also with stallone at the age he is it makes sense to scrap the oneman army idea and provide john with support the mercs that show up dont hog the spotlight but once they get stuck in its pretty coolthe thing that impressed me most was how streamlined the film was its quite short but leaves the viewer wanting more which has to be a good thing also theres no dip in the action once it starts it just gets better and better until the fantastic finale make no mistake theres plenty of moments and i counted at least three occasions where the big guy turns up in the right place at crucial moments when no one else would which gets the viewer punching the air in glee youve gotta admire stallone here hes thrown himself headlong into this project and given 100 to both addressing and depicting the atrocities in burma and to filling the action void thats been leaving many of us without a real hero for years,cruel
wow where to begin this film is one that i can safely say delivers if your a fan of the series you wont be disappointed if you thought some where a little over the top after first blood you still might enjoy this like the other films and to an extent the rocky sequels this film is its own thing one of the things that makes these two series great is the fact each movie can almost be a different genre iii and first blood are chalk and cheese this can turn people off though how id describe is if iii was as realistic as first blood actually showing you what would happen if one man was to go up against an army actually even more realistic no jumping up and grabbing helicopters or firing repeatedly at enemy soldiers and nothing happening but a little hole in there uniforms another problem cynics had was the gap between this and the last film mostly due to stallones age now they could have made a iv in the 90s it probably would have been big and action packed probably something like true lies and it probably would have been entertaining but the time has added to the film and the character if stallone had tried to make another iii it would have been stupid instead he made a film about an ageing warrior is darker inside very much like he was in first blood stallones not just playing him as the super cool action hero but as an angry grizzled war dog an ugly killing machine which i think is better than the othersthe villains in this film are plain evil ive never hated the bad guys like this for years not even the villains in the other s where this bad in fact they where like indiana jones villains were bad just because we are where as the burmese soldiers are shown doing what they do its sickening and you really are routing for them to be killed not just watch killing targets the real footage from the beginning is really horrifying and the ultra violence throughout really slaps you in the face and says this is what war is if you are a huge fan you will feel very much like stallone respects you there is references and little nods throughout to all three films involving a great montage sequence that gave me goosebumps goldsmiths music score is used as masterfully as the music was used in rocky balboa as a director stallone has very much improved the gap between rocky iv to balboa and this youd think it was a different person not that i thought his directing was bad in the past the plot of the film on paper may seem old and predictable but its the way the film is executed no pun intended that makes it so great stallone knows what emotional buttons to push which make this a heart pounding dramathe ending im not gonna give it away i heard people didnt like it i loved it i thought it was the perfect ending not only for the film but for the whole series just like rocky balboa it makes the whole series better as a wholetrautman youre always going to tear away at yourself till you come to terms with what you are till you come full circle,cruel

sly is old  most common comment on why wont you watch the movie you know what it does not matter as this is not oiledskinmuscleflex at local wwf booththe second i have finished watching trailer i knew i will love this movie it already had this dramatic sandinthemouth bloodynose feeling these was no dramatic pauses no overhyped narration nothing like that it was violent of course its an epilogue of the series that has blood in its namecomes back as a broken man with nightmares about his past he lives in a hut and is literary waiting for his life to end there is no joy in his face he is beaten washed out he had few decades to contemplate on his life and its meaning and believe me or not  sly delivers that feeling missionaries approach him for an aid he tries to refuse but in the end gets convinced by a woman julie benz this is a point where one can skip or wonder about the reasonsfirst of all knows whats in burma he saw everything war is about and burma is the worst its genocide civil war he knows that ideals mean nothing there and worst of all  those missionaries are probably going to die does not want to any part in this as it would be kind of his fault too he is only a human though so when a woman symbol of life cycle etc asks him he breaks and at least wants to have his conscience clear and agrees to helps instincts were right  missionaries get into the hands of burmese army then the mercenaries are hired for their rescue and knows he will go into this mission with themnotice that during the movie he is referred to by his name john or as boatman or whatever stallone wants to distance his character from super soldier from the man was in the last two movies this is s last mission he does not care if he will die or not he is no longer a hotshot so no wonder he is not breaking teeth when he gets insulted by the leader of the mercenaries it does not matter anymore the rest of the movie is about violence and real war fights so ferociously as if his soul was already burning in hell for those 20 years after we last saw him in afghanistan as if his desperation anger sadness guilt altogether explode on the screen its not pretty its not enjoyable and there is no easy way talking about itbut i have seen more horrific scenes already the part in saving private ryan where one soldier is pushing knife into another ones heart and asks to hush that one has been haunting me forever what can be more terrifying than those dying soldiers eyes is not however a movie that glorifies violence if it would be so then the violence would have been more cinematic and plastic and cgi and with a lot more fancy guns and explosions and  and and its shown real so you could not possibly enjoy it because its a movie with a message its about failed politics broken ideals and lifes cruelty its about hypocrisy and silent rage its also about hope or at least whats left of it when you have seen it all,cruel

this critic scoffed at earlier posts and reviews claiming that the new film made saving private ryan look like a kids show but after viewing it i cannot name any film ive ever seen with more graphic violence the carnage claims just about everyone too good people and bad people alike are blown to bits with heavy machine guns mortars land mines you name it even old ordinance from wwii is used at one point when it all ends after a fairly brief running time you feel like youve just seen saving private ryan braveheart apocalypto and we were soldiers all at the same time the action is plentiful and wellstaged but the sheer brutality directed at the innocent may have been just a tad too muchsylvester stallone now into his sixties is back as the title character he now apparently makes his living as a snake catcher in thailand all of the violence and death he has either caused or witnessed has really jaded him and he apparently has no plans to ever return home to america one day a group of christian missionaries show up and ask him to take them up river to burma in his boat tries to discourage their journey into such a dangerous place but these people will obviously go in one way or another it can be hard to talk religious fanatics out of things once they make a commitment there is a pretty woman in the group of missionaries and takes a liking to her eventually he decides to take them up river maybe if only to protect this woman hard to say why he decides to do it anyway offs an entire boat of pirates who try to take them prisoner this action stirs the ire of the lead missionary who informs his killings will have to be reported also the group will travel back by land instead of by boat the missionaries are taken captive by the burmese army after a short time in a village full of hapless locals who are then completely slaughtered in a particularly disturbing scene it then is up to and a small team of mercenaries i guess hired by the church to go rescue the remaining missionaries from a heavily guarded camp the rest of the film is an incredible bloodbathafter a fairly successful rescue the film ends somewhat abruptly with a gun battle next to a river the finale kind of reminded me of michael caine in the island machine gunning about 50 pirates on the deck of a ship multiply that scene by about 1000 and you pretty much have the ending of this film even though the violence was jarring there was something i noticed inside the theater that also shook me there was a vietnamese family that showed up kind of late and sat in the same row i did when everyone left i noticed that two of them had to be younger than 10 years old i cannot imagine letting children see something like this film the cruelty and gore might be too much for someone that youngstallone apparently juggled many different story ideas for this film at one point he planned to have return home to arizona and battle drug gangs sneaking across the mexican border finally he called up someone at the un and basically asked what was the most underreported humanitarian crisis in the world the guy he talked to suggested the trouble in burma if its half as bad as this film suggests then i pray for these people but a humanitarian trip might not be such a good idea 8 of 10 starsthe hound,cruel
some people dont like they find it mindless gorelarded violent and jingoistic they should definitely not attend this film or even consider renting it when it comes out as indeed it will on dvd having said that i can honestly say i loved it theres not a whit of intellectualism philosophizing or subtext messaging gone are the anticommunist mia and freedom fighter messages of the earlier first blood films this is just sheer entertainment in the violent action genre and damn good at that stallone looks great and his clenched jaw scowl and contemptuous sneer is as great as ever sure he singlehandedly wipes out a bunch of burmese bad guys but hey we didnt fork over for that high priced ticket for a seat to see him give an inspirational dr phil feelgood talk no we paid to see him kick some butt and believe me he does stereotyped violent yes antiintellectual no anyone who would see a film looking for thought provocation is likely not too bright to begin with save it for a coen brothers film is delightful action entertainment live with it,cruel
john ja name synonymous with action and adventure military violence turned up a decibel over normal with a hero larger than life that is john after closing the book on rocky with rocky balboa stallone decides to come full circle and end the story of john he does it in style while is not the academy movie that rocky was it is still a good film the action is well choreographed and the story well done is is shakespeare no it is expect the limb explosions the gutting of the enemy blood and gorethis is an action film that deals with the unspeakable horrors that people allow to happen all across the world it is saving the daygoing against a tyrant who butchers peopleand helping the helpless is the super blockbuster popcorn crunching mindless fun movie we used to love for a saturday matineohh raahhh loved it it is not as good as first blood or first blood part iibut it is a good action film,cruel
well i have to say that this film was something else from my memories of the first threeas they were all about rescues and honor to fellow soldiers but this one took it to a whole new levelwith missionaries who were brought in to look after the sick and woundedbecause the burmese hillsides were clustered with land mines laid by the military after the abduction of these missionaries by the merciless militaryjohn was hired to bring them out of captivity along with some other mer cswho are in a league of their own to help him the scenes were awesome using explosions of such brutality that some of the characters were dismembered which is what happens in small or large military campaignsgrossly explicit in content and without a doubt the best film sly had to offer in a long time he looks bigger than ever before which is good to see in his role as but what made it more appealing was his return to his homeland of arizona where he could finally reconcile with his dadthough we dont see itall except his ranch still from being a mindless killing machine who had a grudge with the worldhe was still human who needed familymuch like colonel troutman was to him from fort brag excellent to watchhope to see a new stallone later on,cruel

please note i posted my review on several message boards just editing it for user guidelines and to save time this is not a web raising attempt by the industry this is from a true fan and may contain a few spoilersok heres the deal i was really disappointed that they were coming out with a new i thought with the unrealistic yet some how entertaining 3 the fourth installment would surely be the massacre of another 80s iconic charactermuch to my ignorant surprisedelivers if u are expecting a plot an oscar winner or a dramago home this is clearly not the movie for u then this is for the early 80s kids like me that know what a true action movie is and what its worth action movies mean real stunt men blowing things up no overabundance of cgi and a fastpaced movieand did i mention action if u liked the success of transformers and thought it was a good reinventing of a legend then youll most definitely like there isnt a minute after the first 30 minutes where this movie slows down seriously if sly wanted to end his career as an action star on a good note this is the way to do itabsolutely do not listen to the critics they were way way off on this one one critic called it boringthe whole thing is a blood bathhow the hell is that boring when that guy dissipated with that stationary machine gun as shown in the trailer i was left wanting more when used that machine gun period the audience wanted to join in he action now as i try and calm down because i am pumped up like a us green beret giving an a kicking i will tell uif u havent seen and want an entertaining old school action movie go see it it does not disappointif u want to see a beautiful mind monsters ball or even atonement which are good quality dramas then do not see sly does not disappoint this time around just keep the following things in mind 1 there are no matrixstyle effects2 expect minor plot with tons of explosions true to the old school action movie way3 do not listen to the critics on this one 4 and lastly do not compare to rocky this is the classic sly mistake yes theyre both his iconic characters but nothey are not even close to being the same is dark rocky is upliftingif you keeps these little things in mind you will most likely use this clearly as an entertainment experience seeing as obviously is not real life,cruel
i went for this movie sensing that this movie will be stallonestallone and only stallone with his rifle n going solobut it was a pleasant surprise to see him with some others as welportraying his age that he cant do it all solo nemorethough i did miss his rifle and the serrated knifei would have preffered ti to be a tad bit less goryi simply loved the ending seeing him go back to arizona to his home to see his father i guesswas pretty surprised to see getting a simultaneaous release here in india as we saw rocky6 like after 2 monthsall i can say is thoughthank you mrstalloneand since he has not yet unconfirmed reports of this being the last filmall i wanna say is bring us more,cruel
maybe its just the mood ive been in lately being fed up with the human race or at least those to whom i have to talk but i was absolutely ready for a movie like this my only qualm was that it wouldnt be gory enough too few bodies i neednt have worried hits the cinematic nail on the head and then some and no sylvester stallone does not look over the hill he looks about the way youd expect a grizzled sixtyyearold killing machine to look who hasnt spent the last decade or so drinking beer on the sofawhat has been doing lately it seems is hiding out in thailand catching snakes and arrowing fish for a living stallone who also cowrote and directed sets the tone early with some choice footage of atrocities committed by the burmese military the reallife burmaexcuse me myanmaris a perfect example of how a dictatorship can go on for years without being bothered by america they simply have nothing we want keep aung san suu kyi in house arrest forever shoot and club and teargas a few buddhist monks and nuns in the streets never mind we have other things to focus on like colonizing oilrich iraq the worldweary gets a visit from some justannoyingenoughwithoutbeingcaricatures christian missionaries who want him to take them into hostile territory for humanitarian purposes at first gruffly blows them off but then changes his mind after apparently taking a liking to the blonde female member of the group director stallone wisely wastes no time on hamletlike indecision one moment is frowning in the rain the next theyre en route up the river when they encounter some pirates what ensues is pretty well predictable but thats part of the pleasure of this kind of flick the anticipation and then the fulfillment of it like pornography you may say uh yeahso if you dont like it dont watch it those of us who like it leave us aloneafter the plucky dogooders inevitably get captured joins a motley crew of mercenaries to go rescue them these dogs of war seem just a little too civilized except for one scarfaced brit sas guy who has some of the best lines but i guess we need to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys the burmese the rescue raid on the encampment nicely intercuts the action with a setpiece involving some female captives forced into giving a dance performance for the troops that quickly devolves into a gangshag from here on just sit back and enjoy the carnage this is one of the few movies ive seen in a theater that made me regret i couldnt have a beer with me i really admire stallone for going balls to the walls with the violence and the language in a current atmosphere where on any given weekend there may be one rrated film in my area if that its as though hes saying ive had a long career ive made lots of money now im going to do what i want you dont like it too bad the sequence where cuts loose with a 50caliber machine gun alone is worth the price of admission anyone whos had the chance to fire one of those knows what a rush it is stallone even has pull a sonny chiba in one scene if youve seen street fighter you know what i mean looks great too stallone has learned well what spielberg pioneered in saving private ryan i even forgive him the occasional arty touch like having flames reflected in the villains sunglassesso do i have any quibbles not reallyi got what i paid for and ill probably see it again next weekend and enjoy it just as much or more sure it wouldve been fun if stallone had tossed in a reference to blackwater usa and the ending with walking back to his fathers ranch in arizona seems an anticlimax but if this does well at the box office why not leave open the possibility of another one i admit that when the few remaining leading men in cinema who are older than i am show they can still kick some ass ill come to see m do it so long as it has an r ratingsorry harrison ford as indiana jones again ill be shocked if thats not rated pg13for those who crave sex with their violence sorry it only gets hinted at which again id expected possible favorite moment when the most egregiously pious of the missionaries who earlier had chided for killing the pirates even though it kept the blonde from getting raped reverts to visceral mode and whacks somebody to death in the heat of battle there are no atheists in foxholes ive heard but i doubt there are many volunteer martyrs either,cruel
people are so in denial of what kind of senseless torture and violence goes on in these type of countries if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen im just laughing reading the bad reviews where people claim to walk out of the theater because they cannot handle the violence this is what soldiers see everyday things like this happen all the time children are murdered massacred thrown into the fire beheaded you name it they do it i applaud stallones effort in having the balls to show it how it truly is what do people think happens in a war zone there is nothing but mayhem blood guts flesh and endless violence that is really pointless but that is just the way it is deal with it i mean these are grown man walking out of the theater because it is just too much for them to handle i can understand women and children not wanting to see this but grown men maybe they should just go back to their little peaches and herb life and live in denial and avoid the realism of war and the kind of things that go on thousands and thousands of miles away,cruel
ok i see a lot of positive reviews here and i had huge expectations for this movie before i went to see it but i have to say i wasnt pleased with the end resulti have always been a huge fan so i was looking forward to this but i shall explain why i wasnt happythe movie was too short and there wasnt enough screen time for character development for neither the main characters or anyone else for that matter i couldnt help thinking that this film lacked the magic of the previous three films one thing i noticed half way through the movie was the absence of s trademark knife this for me was a major disappointment it wasnt just a knife it was a symbol more than anything which evolved as the films progressed i was glad to see the return of the bow and headband but the knife should have been thereapart from that the whole film was just mindless brutality i really didnt have a problem with the violence but it was the justification i had trouble coming to terms with was immensely barbaric in this movie and most of the killing was unnecessarythe story for me wasnt strong enough to hold the film something else i was displeased with is that there is no reference to col trautman who was integral to all the films his death should have been mentioned somewhere in the film or some sort of reference but there was nothingwhat made the action in the previous films so unique was the clever traps set in the jungles none of which we saw in this latest installment of the franchise i will say it again it was just mindless explosions repeating over and overi was glad to see the reprise of jerry goldsmiths wonderful music but it was the same theme playing over and over again we never heard the triumphant themes which we are so familiar with and the score just didnt have enough depthlastly i have a problem with the title it was initially going to be called john than they changed their minds and called it just why not just call it 4 since thats what it is sly made the same mistake with the last rocky film and now he is done it again here i really cant see the sense in itoverall i just see this as nothing but a pointless action film,cruel
yeah whom do i talk to for the movie refund  i left the theater feeling so ripped off i know going in that this will probably be shoot em and blow em movie but i had no idea it is this bad the story is so thin sly and the cast failed to make any sort of emotional connection with the audience the movie is also shot with a weird style the scene looks grainy at times im not sure if the director was trying to be artsy or dont know what would look good in a theater stallone looks okay i was expecting worse for a 61 year old man but he keeps his shirt on most of the time maybe to keep his gut from showing dont go to this movie youll regret the time wasted waiting for the community theater acting to stop and the real movie to start,cruel
i suppose it makes economic sense to design a film this way it has one scene only the shootout at the end this is what the target audience comes to see everything else is setup and justification the asians are baddie bad bad the mercenaries are only in need of a disciplined superior the missionaries are a useless bunch women are there only to be saved even in the case when there is no rewardso the only way to comment on such a film is to judge it on its own terms does that final shootout do the jobit is a mess how could this be we have a relatively experienced filmmaker a whole lot of experience making essentially the same film over and over and a sufficient budgetit doesnt take a whole lot to simply copy others in setting up the flow of the battle the dance around the battlefield and the choreography of death but the craft here is no different than a western from the 40s where bad guys do acrobatics as they fall from buildings a big disappointment cinematically surely nothing to justify the other offensesteds evaluation  1 of 3 you can find something better to do with this part of your life,cruel
generally speaking i think belated sequels made a long while after the original are a very bad thing but thats certainly not the case here as stallone roars back on to the screen as the disgruntled vietnam veteran john in pure bloodsoaked style and this latest entry in the series is by far the best to date serious kudos has to go to stallone for this movie  not only does he return to what is probably his second most famous role after rocky he also wrote directed and produced the film  almost making a one man show the action in this film centres on the war in burma and stallone starts off by showing us how brutal the military there is then we shift to the star of the show  and currently hes in thailand helping to collect snakes for a local snake show his life takes a turn one day when some damn foolish idealists turn up wanting a ride in his boat to burma after much deliberation he decides to give them a lift there however pretty soon it transpires that they have been taken prisoner by the burmese army and ends up giving the same lift to some mercenariesthe burmese war makes for an interesting backdrop for the film  i certainly dont know much about it and the asian jungle location is just perfect for an action movie like this of course doesnt have much of a point to make  you could possibly argue that its a brutal condemnation of warfare  but clearly the only point here is for stallone to shoot stab and explode his way through everything with a pulse  and i certainly have no problem with that naturally the action is the main focal point of the film and stallone throws in plenty  barely a minute goes by without someone getting killed and the body count of over 200 is mightily impressive it could even be said that the film is mainstream exploitation  it really feels like stallone isnt holding back at all and its great to see a movie that doesnt pull its punches  highlights include a mass of soldiers getting torn to pieces by a chaingun wielding and a solider having his throat ripped out by the veterans bear hands at sixty one years of age youd be forgiven for thinking that stallone is getting too old for this sort of stuff but in fact its the opposite  he fits the role in this film much better than he did in the previous roles his angry look and stout posture is absolutely perfect and while this film wont go down as a masterpiece  it certainly is a lot of fun and comes highly recommended to everyone who enjoys a brutal action movie,cruel
is definitely one sick action flick that brings the genre back to where it was back in the 80sits a movie for guys who like movies where the baddies are super bad and the hero doesnt take that kind of crap its balls to the walls action that doesnt pull any punchesstallone is awesome once again as john and his writing and directing seem just perfect for this kind of film we dont get bored by 30 minute buildupthe action starts pretty quickly and for the most part doesnt let up how this film didnt get an nc17 rating is unknown to me but i am glad stallone had enough balls to make sure it was ratedr and didnt try to pull out some pg13 the film is in your face violent it shows no fear in showing young kids dying women getting raped blood and guts getting spilled around these bad guys are pure evil just as they are in the real world you cant wait for to get his hands on these evil bastards as in most action films of the 80s the acting is sub par at best with stallone actually giving the best performance the direction is better then expected with steady shots in time of peace and more camera movement during times of violenceall said this is definitely one of the best pure action films to come out in a long time the kind of film where you can check your brain and still have a great time a must see for all who love the action genre 12 out of ,cruel
2008  sylvester stallone julie benz paul schulze ken howard graham mctavish matthew marsden jake la botz stallones iconic vietnam vet killing machine extraordinaire john is back with a vengeance in this entertaining and attimesover thetop brutally violent chapter in the franchise instilling some new bloodshed this time with our reluctant hero called into action when an american missionary troupe is savagely attacked after he escorted them into the burma jungle resulting in their dire need of rescue directed produced and cowritten by stallone with art monterastelli the film delivers the brutal bloody goods with a decent body count and  hey a relative political message to the truetolife genocide in the nation at hand,cruel
i really havent been a fan of stallones for well lets face it the vast majority of my life i dont like his politics im not a great fan of his opinions and for decades literally he hasnt made a movie worth seeing twice rocky and thats pretty much it dont get me wrong thats more than i have to say for myself but as far as calling an actor on his movies thats all stallones really had i have to say though 2008is the best action movie i have seen in a long long time long long long time anybody remember the end of first blood the speech they make him try and deliver for me that ruined everything a man of actions reduced to that just the crying quietly in a corner would have made more sense this time he stands there quiet saying exactly what he should is the movie violent not enough seriously its a war what should it have bloodless plastic violence like some made for tv garbage i think they did a decent job of keeping from being a cartoon character like he became before this is the best action movie popularly released in decades,cruel
vi was my favorite of all the movies some of the things in this film really captivated me after i watched it the music always fit the scene there was never music that seemed out of place which just made the whole movie fly by without thinking about it some of the scenes were pretty intense in fact my girlfriend who has seen many war movies actually got up and left for a certain part of the film it wasnt because of the gore but from other scenes involving women and their treatmentadditional characters really made this film believable sure some parts not unlike many movies were a bit over the top but nevertheless a great film to watchif you havent seen the other movies i suggest you watch them before you watch vi i think that doing your homework will allow you to appreciate the vi more,cruel
this review contains no spoilers i enjoyed this movie and i do not work for lionsgate as hinted by some previous reviewers i watched this movie in a packed house 1st showing and the audience applauded at the end this new episode of needs to be looked at mostly along side ii and iii first blood was its own thing and could sit alone without any sequels and it would still have the same reputation it has today a pretty good actiondrama now getting to the sequels ii had a high budget and lots of action but it was bogged down in my opinion by small sets and some pretty crummy dialog iii was a bit more intricate with bigger more grand looking sets decent dialog and a lot of action at the time it seemed that the plot was a bit foreign to most because people did not care nor really have any idea of what was going on between the russians the afghansand the us complicity in their war anyways getting back to the new film in a way it reminds me of ii set in the jungle in burma this film has a lot of action and lots of shoot em up carnage but the difference is the partial reality of the plot and the fact that it appears to be on a bigger scale like iii but holding the intensity of the original first blood as far as the filming overall the film looks pretty good there are some choppy transition for a few minutes just after the first 13 of the film but it does not last long a few scenes of awkward dialog but overall the film seems pretty well put together and actually there are some beautiful overheads of the jungle kind of appealing in a waynow for the action the body counts are the highest ever the gore is pretty extreme big explosions but the films violence is based in the idea of combat for me the pure combat scenes reminded me of saving private ryan for their intensity yes some of the violence is a bit over the top and gratuitous but hey its this is a very good actionwar movie and for its genre it is top notch and will satisfy those who are fans of the series and fans of action films,cruel
first blood was a master piece first blood part ii wad a lot of fun iii was entertaining but has brought us back to the masterpiece we in 1982 combined with the fun and entertainment we had in 85 and 88 vietnam vet john returns in this forth installment a lot more hardened and grumpy than we remember him the years have hardened him and though the scars of his past are faded they are still visible what i liked most about this was how his character finally comes full circle with who he is he understands that he is and will always be a killing machine he understands that he never killed for his country but for himself and in the end as he stands over the battlefield with all the dead soldiers below him he finally realizes that war never ends it has been happening for years and will continue war is nature and peace is a mistake but the last couple of minutes of the movie were very interesting and gets you a little on the inside in a good way now action fans will not be disappointed the action in this movie is the greatest action ever to be shot on film and the brutality of it is overwhelming once gets hold of a machine gun on the back of a jeep you know the bad guys are screwed all and all it was the best film of the series and if you love and action you ow it to yourself to see this movie,cruel
the whole theater was clapping at the end it was so much sick fun the machine gun killing the civilian killing the knife killing his stony expression the giant explosions truly inspiring it brought goosebumps we loved it its not a chick flick though i really feel that this is one of the greatest movies of all time ive never been to very many movies that make me feel like this to the core of my being killing is easy as breathing indeed the sight of coming down hard on these bad bad bad men is truly great and the great thing is that the movie actually sets up the bad guys so you know they are truly evil so you want to do what he does to them a must see,cruel
i just came back from seeing and i am honestly speechless this movie completely lives up to its hype and has some of the most amazing action scenes ive ever seen in my life i dont care what people say about his age sylvester stallone did an amazing job acting and directing this movie in fact i think he did a better job now then in the previous movies you will love every part of in this one his voice his little emotion the only one being anger his very few diologue is not for everyone though before seeing it just realize this movie has basically no plot whatsoever just complete killing and you will see why this movie was almost nc17 i highly recommend this movie to any action fan and am giving it a 10 out of 10,cruel
went to a 600 showing right after work today i got to the theater and there was maybe ten people in there including the people i was with this kind of irked me off a bit as i want this movie to do extremely well ah well well see the final figures after the weekend is over heres hoping for a huge return because stallone deserves itthis is what i want in a ballstothewall action movie no jumping off the walls matrix stuff no perfectly choreographed gun battles no misunderstood villain it was a hero and his companions battling forces of pure evil in 92 minutes of raw action you hated the bad guys and wanted the good guys to win i felt bad for how the villagers were tortured and wanted evil to burn for it thats it its absolutely everything i expected it to bespoiler my favorite scene when the boat was stopped by that gang of baddies and cut them down in a matter of seconds after they made it very clear that they were taking the girl with them whether our heroes liked it or not then that guy bitches to about how killing is never right bullcrap these people were about to take your girlfriend and do god knows what to her you wimp i was just waiting for this guy to get what was coming to him these types always seem to get it the worst but i got something even better  later on in the heat of the final showdown he frigging smashes a bad guy upside the head with a rock until hes dead its like screw your hippie beliefs they dont mean squat until it really counts and you need to make a choice between your life and the life of the guy trying to kill your ass right on sly screw compassion this is these people must be schooled properoh what a glorious showdown the end was every possible way to get taken down with a machine gun is explored in this fifteen minute symphony of raw chaosit just felt damn good to sit back relax and enjoy a real action movie at the movies for a change my only complaint is that the film feels a little too short but hey always leave them wanting more right i knew exactly what i wanted out of this movie and it totally delivered bravo sly,cruel
congrats sly you have once again reinvented and brought us a new installment of one of the best movie franchises in history what he did with rocky balboa last year he does once again in this movie is awesome the action is perfectly spaced out and well done stallone looks great as and the movie plays out even better while watching this i have never rooted for a character more in a movie than i did in this i wanted to punish the enemy burmese characters more than anything they were just brutal people it makes me feel as if we need a john in todays society hahaoverall it was the most fun action movie i have seen in a while and although it is incredibly gory and intense it made it feel more realistic and had you rooting for john from the start great job stallone910,cruel
i had previously heard about the movies and with the fourth one coming out i became very interested in them i decided to watch the 3 first movies a week before the new one came out the movies were pretty good and i enjoyed all three second was best but now in all honesty all three combined do not even come close to absolutely amazing the action scenes are so well made that before you know it the movie will be over if your a gore hound run to your nearest theater and watch it it is probably the most violent movie i have ever seen people get blown up in blurs of organs and blood heads are blown off limbs are cut off squeamish people stay away from this movie you will leave in the first 30 minutes if your a fan it is a must see if your more into the whole deep story thinking thing you might not like it but you should still give it a try its has to be good because me and my friends actually sat down and talked about how good it was for 30 minutes excellent movie best action movie i have ever seenmust see,cruel
having grown up in the 1980s i am happy to say that i am a fan the movie series is without question a guilty pleasure for me and whenever i am flipping channels and see one of these films on tv ill always stop to watch is the writing genius or oscar worthy certainly not but what these films lack in artistic measure more than make up in the pure entertainment department is no exception and in the course of the series is by far the best entry since first bloodthis film delivers exactly what it promises and is a nice combination of first blood and first blood part 2 it pulls no punches unlike the watered down theatrical version of live free or die hard revels in its brutality clearly stallone heard the fans express their complaints when the new die hard movie lacked blood and profanity has plenty of both the bad guys are really bad and when they die they die really horrible graphic deaths all while the audience cheers for their hero this film deserves 8 out of 10 because for a movie it is that good if you are a fan of the series you will absolutely love this film if you are not a fan of the other films in the series you probably wont like this one either but then again if you arent a fan why else would you be watching a movie in the first place again i loved this movie watching vs say saving private ryan is like eating a candy bar it has very little nutritional value but it sure tastes good,cruel
steeped in war john now lives in the backwaters of thailand running a small boat catching snakes and generally staring off into the distance in a way that only men do when they have seen really bad things when a group of american dogooder christian types come to him to get him to ferry them into burma to help the people he refuses knowing that peace is no solution to war  only war he relents thanks to the charms of one of the group sarah and leaves them up in burma weeks later though he is approached by the head of their church who has lost contact with them and has paid a group of mercenaries to find them once drops the group off at the same spot john finds that he cannot deny what is in his blood and naturei had no real interest in watching this film and expected almost nothing from it but my girlfriend picked it having never seen a film and we sat to watch it from the very first scene we are shown clearly how bad the baddies are and after some scenes of scene setting etc the film soon gets into sporadic action before diving into a final third that is essentially one big bloody action scene leading to a conclusion that makes 3 versus entire russian army in afghanistan seem quite lowkey and modest to my credit i was mostly right about this film but this is not a film that really cares about much but the violence and on that front it delivers in one of the most brutal and unbelievable manners i think i have seen the absolute lions share of the budget must have been sent on effects because essentially the film is about people being blown apart by bombs of shreddedsplattered with bullets in ways that i really hope never to experience in real life ignoring the wider issues for a minute it is hypnotically grotesque and as much as i wanted to be above it it was impossible to look away and not be impressed by it on a technical level and be drawn into it as raw actionthe problems come when the film even gives you a second to think  which doesnt really occur in the brilliantly bloody final third however it does for the majority of the film scenes of brutality on innocents are perhaps too real for a film that is not about the issues but is entirely about the entertainment value of war and violence am i the only one who felt a bit uncomfortable seeing limbs hacked off children in a film that didnt have a wider agenda well maybe that is unfair because the film does have a message  just one that is quite unpleasant essentially war and violence is the only way to solve problems and the film literally hammers this home by having burnett realise this in a visceral way whether he can accept the truth or not it is a depressing message and delivered in a thoughtless manner when really it could have done the opposite more hopeful message while still delivering the same action ill not labour this because it is not a surprise that it is this way  just a shame but after all this is a film whose script must not have taken a lot of development from the 3sentence pitch that got it the moneythe cast get into the urgency and danger of the action and all the men play their men of war bits really well stallone hulks around the place to no great verbal effect but his presence works well for the action sequence marsden is good as are mctavish gallegos and a few others of the mercenaries benz is annoyingly obvious but does well enough for what the film asks her to do schulze has a poor character and he only does what it requires him to do but to his credit he sells himself on it and does well despite the moral message that he has to somehow deliver like it wasnt written for him in crayon the real star of the film is not any of these actors though but the crew not only does the cinematography make the film look great but the effects are deeply impressive technically and it is disturbing just how real the cinematic violence looks hereis by most yardsticks a terrible piece of sh1t with a plot like a level in a average video game a script with only marginally more dialogue than a silent film and a moral message that would even make bush and cheney appear liberal however how much i should about this is questionable when the film only has one aim and that is to make as much bloody action as possible in this area it is actually quite good as it delivers amazingly brutal effects and overblown action that will no doubt have armies of teenage boys in fits of joy other audiences should approach with caution perhaps but if what you want matches what this film is selling then you should not be disappointed,cruel
from the very first musical strains is hearkening back to first blood the original film in the series whose title character has since become a household name this glossingover of two forgettable sequels is a smart move and it sets the tone for a film which save for a greatly aged protagonist could easily have come as the second film instead of the fourththis film finds our hero far away from the world catching snakes somewhere near burma a group of missionaries arrive he cautions them gives them a ride into burma and then flexes his muscles without surprise when he learns that they never made it back for a brief moment towards the beginning there is the feeling that is evoking the memory of vietnam making reference to staying out of the worlds problems and things never changing ie genocide this bringing of the saga fullcircle to the conflict where it began is an intriguing idea that is quickly lost in a deluge of bloodin the first film john held himself back reigned in his instinct to kill never even finishing off his nemesis in the film a smalltown sheriff here however he begins by gunning down a boatload of burmese pirates and doesnt stop until hes shot decapitated and disemboweled a small army if ever there was any idea behind thoughts to the effect of minding your own business or pacifism being as deadly as genocide theyre lost when the bloodbath begins and are never found againa few fascinating concepts are batted around in but are quickly discarded when they get in the way of the carnage because it would be far too much work to decide where to stand when gunning down the bad guys is so much simpler but for what it is is a successold grizzled and jaded hes still got it and watching his demonstrate that for the better part of two hours is surprisingly entertaining the film also makes a good call in throwing in a supporting cast of mercenaries who far from being subtle and nuanced characters do add something of a foil for johnevery time i think about i get to thinking about how originally the character was meant to die at the end of first blood a move which would have rendered it impossible to create any sequels preview audiences didnt like it and so he survived to fight several more times while i still feel that dead or alive there should never have been more than one film this is about as good and endcap fingers crossed that i could hope for and the fact that it tries to bring back memories of the first film while practically ignoring the second and third leads me to believe that perhaps im not the only one who thinks so,cruel
2008 the fourth film in the franchise is the ultimate action film from 2008 it is a badass action film since iii 1988 20 years come out it was a huge improvement over 3 i love this film to death most of the action films are not that gory like this movie it fast paced it goes quickly around and sylvester stallone returns as john and he reloads his famous character he portrays john well this is my comic book hero yes john is my ultimate action hero of all timei am glad stallone made the fourth film and now sly wants to make v and his 70 years old how will that work stallone throw that idea years ago because he was un happy the fourth film in my opinion made a full circle and he close the character well we dont need another sequel and v will be awful leave our character alone stallone sylvester stallone returns as john the former green beret and vietnam veteran who in present day works as a boat captain in southeast asia and takes a job transporting missionaries on a medical aid mission when the missionaries are captured by burmese junta soldiers joins a group of mercenaries on a rescue missionthis is stallones only movie he written and directed him self the action is gory and bloody that i love it is using a browning m2 aircraft machine gun uses the m2 to obliterate the driver and than he kills all the soldiers while he is reloading the machine gun m2  50cal bmg and he kills all the soldiers that scene kicks ass you have a lot of fire power in here and i love the rescue mission in here this is a badass kickass film i love s mini machete he uses in this movie he chops peoples heads off he sets mines against burmese soldiersrichard crenna and jerry goldsmith did not return for the fourth film because they both past away and are no longer with us anymore brian tyler did a music score for the film and in my opinion did a good music score for the film like jerry goldsmith did for the first three film in my opinion brian tylers score is great for the film,cruel
one of the best remakes of a movieever the first one was a classic the second one was iconic of the 80s and after that it rapidly went down hillthis one however absolutely fantastic,cruel
more soldiers and really everybody needs to aspire to be like the crimes depicted in the film are heinous and evil and they are met with equal force and violence from the side of light and god and at the end of the day light drove out darkness but with casualities sadly,cruel
im sorry for all stallone fans 410 may seem like injustice but it is for a reason this movie is totally manipulative what this movie does is displaying shocking images with civilians being brutally murdered then makes you feel a strong revenge emotion then bring the saver to kill the bad guys nothing new in a movie only the brutal killings are atrocious just to cause a strong revenge feeling this is all a lie and who is perpetrating it stallone of course the good guy in the movie who in fact is the shady guy in real life who wrote this movie i mean trowing kids in fire repeated scenes with shooting kids and stabbing women the killing of an entire village man by man woman by woman elder by elder piece by piece leg by leg arm by arm its just an horrible manipulation which shows in fact whats inside this stallone guy like everyone here ive seen countless films with actionvillainswaratrocities and so on simply this movie was only written to play with watchers emotions in a shady way,cruel
my favorite in the series its basically a combination of the first and second movie with a bit realistic approach compared to the past films and that is a good thing doesnt use his exploding arrows or bazooka which was featured in the second and third movies but the action is way more bloody and gruesome this time around and more gripping while being less silly it has both great and entertaining action while also keeping humanism aspects of it intact which was in the first movie the second and third movies were basically rescue missions this one is basically similar but the people that has been captured are irritating to watch yeah they are good people and want to help and change the lives of the people in burma that is going through some horrendous time because of the genocide and rape that is being committed against them but the captured group of people seem stupid which applies to real people that tried to do similar stuff in other dangerous areas and gets captured and ends up paying dearly for it the group that is trying to help the poor villagers although like i said has good intentions doesnt even try to listen to the warning that gives who they even know as a person for knowing the rivers and area very well and to top it off one of the so called helpers for the poor villagers throws a hissy fit when saves their lives but the villains this time around makes up for it this is the most evil group of villains in the series they no only commit genocide and rape against innocent villagers but uses them as slaves for sex and fighting for their own selfish needs the atrocities the villains commit even as a audience i wanted to see some vengeance i literally couldnt help cheer for when he is fighting his enemies in this one since i detest the villains a heck of a lot this time around it was just so satisfying when they start getting owned doesnt go on this mission alone this time around in fact he goes in with a group of mercenaries that actually stand out a bit for side characters especially the mercenary called school boy who is the sniper of the group i know mgs and the video game character solid snake is influenced by but watching this was like watching mgs with its stealth kills and all which is a good thing cause there is hardly any good video game movies and if there is a mgs movie it can learn from this film overall great film with some messages to go with it although some of the messages is similar to the first i just wished this was longer cause it felt pretty short and yet complete at the same time7810,cruel
this fourth instalment in the series is quite possibly the best visceral violence and action take centrestage with a nononsense storyline and some excellent direction as ever john is drawn into a war zone a team of christian missionaries take the ludicrous step of travelling deep into burma where surprise surprise many of them are slaughtered or taken prisoner cue john making the boldest of rescue missions alongside a team of mercenaries the sheer amount of firepower was staggering as and the team battle the burmese military junta the film concludes with one of the most spectacular shootouts i have ever seen before our hero finally comes full circle and returns home to meet his dad once more whereas most modern action films are watered down for a pg1312a rating this was a proper fullon action movie a brilliant film and a worthy reminder that sly stallone knows how to make a topnotch movie,cruel
i remember seeing a trailer once on another website and thinking oh my what a film we are in for so i gathered a few friends and off we went to see it firstly i was delighted to hear hed kept all the original music which was just brilliant so u get that real feeling right from the start and the film doesnt drag out too like a lot of these big budget action films u see more of these days this guy knows who he is hes not running round trying to find out who he is oh no it starts steady and builds nicely in to an unbelievable pace of action and drama i was a massive fan anyway but of course along like a lot of other people i didnt want to see stallone fall flat on his face running round with an oily body and a skimpy vest on in another so called flop of a film the guy is in his 60s now and hes still in brilliant shape and he realises that he just doesnt need to run round in vests any more blowing everyone up instead he runs around in a tatty tshirt blowing everyone up but this time in a more believable and satisfying fashion after seeing what the bad guys are up to this time i loved this film right to the point no unrealistic action sequences or plots its just breathtaking,cruel
i liked first blood sylvester stallones first outing as disaffected special forces commando john i liked the films simplicity and rawness and the audacity of its story about a putupon vietnam vet who endures one punch too many from a local redneck sheriff and ends up singlehandedly destroying the entire town great stuff but i wasnt crazy about the sequels they seemed a little slick and overproduced almost too artfully composed and pretty to look at in spite of the thousands of rounds of ammunition expended ii and iii seemed as sterile bloodless and sanitary as an inflight moviethat all changed with the initial trailers for which were so astonishingly graphic it was clear that mr stallone was up to something entirely different when i finally saw the film i was stunned by the bravura intensity of it this was a picture with cajones as massive as its 50calibre firepower a brutal and uncompromising vision of hell and retribution that dug deep into the mud and the blood of guerrilla warfare and flung it full into our faces the minimalist storyline and dialogue notwithstanding is one of the goriest most viscerally violent movies this side of the machine girl and therein lies its ferocious power and genius stallone threw out the rulebook took the gloves off and made the bloodiest most inyourface battle movie ever captured on film by comparison the infamous opening sequence of saving private ryan seems about as gruesome as a stroll through mister rogers neighborhood sam peckinpah would be proud and i mean that as a complimentin a way is stallones unforgiven as clint eastwood said of that film the moral of it was the violence the gunplay and the same is certainly true here the christian missionaries in learn the hard way that turning the other cheek isnt alway helpful in this instance the only successful antidote to unspeakable evil is an agent whose terrible capacity for rage and annihilation exceeds even that of his enemies in this respect works magnificentlya number of film critics have excoriated stallone for overstating the level of governmentsanctioned brutality in myanmar however as a cardcarrying member of amnesty international ive followed the atrocities in the former republic of burma for many years and can attest to the authenticity of the atrocities depicted in the film interestingly the freedom fighters of myanmar have enthusiastically embraced as a heroic validation of their struggle and are reportedly smuggling bootlegged copies of stallones film into the country as a rousing moraleboosterfor stateside audiences a word of caution is in order is definitely not for the kiddies nor is it for the impressionable or the easily upset aside from martin scorceses taxi driver stallones contains perhaps the most extreme violence ever depicted in any mainstream american film which doesnt make it bad only controversialon behalf of those of us who arent easily offended welcome back sly youre in fine form kicks boatloads of asswe cant wait to see v,cruel
with we have yet another example of an action hero coming out of retirement it seems to be a recent trend and has provided mixed results john is now peacefully living along the salween river in thailand he is still haunted by old memories of war but he seems to able to deal with it when some missionaries that helped ferry to burma get taken hostage by the military he helps some mercenaries get them outat face value the formula here is just like the ii and iii which were big overblown action movies for fans of the genre only pretty much however in pulling one of his more famous characters out into action stallone hasnt really created a sequel to ii and iii but something that is more like a proper sequel to the first more seriously toned film this folks isnt an action movie  yes it is exciting with some very intense action scenes but stallone was out to make something serious here and as far as i am concerned he did he pulls virtually no sucker punches and sensationalist gimmicks in depicting some truly disturbing war time atrocities and paints a very ugly picture of an ugly war but it feels like it is true one scene has a young boy aged probably 8 at most get shot by a junta soldier and another scene has a boy whos probably younger thrown into a house right before it is set ablaze with a flamethrower thats right folks serious stuff and it doesnt stop there some may consider that excessive but the film is just about that the story and plot here are secondary to the image of a war that is very real and not very known to many peoplethe film also has the shakycam style that is ever popular today but unlike many other films that i have seen with this style the camera here seems to be in control of the chaos that it creates the action is unlike many other films that use this technique watchable you can actually follow what is going on and this camerawork goes hand in hand with the on screen intensity meaning no pointless shaky shots during calm scenesthe main character john is also dealt with in a nice manner and by the end of the film the as originally shown in the first blood comes to a nice concluding arc that spares clichoverall this is a strong well executed and mature film that spares exploitation in showing some awfully violent things the violence here serves a much greater purpose than to just entertain as it is did in ii and iii  810bscdb classification ages 16  violencebrutality,cruel
john returns to get his killing fix in this fourth kickass part of the seriesnow lives as asnakefarmer in thailand working as a grunt and living the simple life far away from his native arizona he is approached by a group of bible thumping peace activists to ask to transport them up up the river to burma to help the locals who are being ravaged by a devastating civil war where they are tortured raped and murdered with no mercy first denies to help them telling them to go home and fk the world because he believes they will not change anything he later gives in cruises them up the river and drops them off st really hits the fan when the burmese military raid the local village and holds the peaceniks as captives has no choice but to team up with a band of mercenaries strap on a commando knife and bail their sally asses out of troubleand the heads do rollliterallyi have to admit going into this movie i was expecting a real crapfest comeback film as i felt the same before going to see rocky balboa once again  i stand correctedthis movie has a solid plot and some really serious action extreme gore and killings are not held back for anything right from the beginning watching this flick had some nostalgic properties to it for myself growing up as a child in the 80s and being a big fan of stallonethe action sequences are brutal realistic and very graphic and not for the squeamish but they are awesome theres one thing that is still prevalent and still remains in this series of films after all these years john still has a hard on for carnage almost to the point of unnecessary overkill like the part when he gets a bad guy in a headlock and chokes him from behind but thats not enough no he proceeds to rip out the guys trachea with his bare handsweet all i gotta say is rent this fans you will not be let down,cruel
i just received the ultimate collectors set of all four movies and here are some of my thoughts of the latest effort from stallone spoilers ahead that meaning im going to reveal details of the gore the real meat of the movie  not the plotthe movie is not perfect its far from it but holy crap hats off to the crew for making me feel like i was watching the original three movies as a kid everything in the movie definitely over the top its kinda like some old cheese you forgot in the refrigerator in the 80s and now that you found it stallone has understood a new movie in the 00s can only succeed if it took what has happened to movie violence in 20 years and then bringing it back to the 80s and then added an iconic character to the equationback in the days of first blood part ii or iii im leaving first blood out of this since its a very different movie when someone gets shot at and dies its just a body falling down and maybe a patch of blood on the chest but in this its the body exploding in two halves heads get pulverized also babies are thrown into a flaming buildingsin a way the violence is similarly over the top as in most 80s shoot em ups except its in great detail and probably much more realistic or fits in the current version of realistic cinematic violence after so many years john has become such an iconic character that you dont think ripping the adams apple out a bad guys throat is unbelievable i didnt make that one up its just natural progression from the noshirt in afghanistanthe fact is that cant die ever period even if he gets shot at by an army while being basically the only one shooting back without a shirt on here the suspension of disbelief is bargained quite logically for example is able to kill five bad guys that are standing in front of him only because he shots first while again has the biggest gun in the end and mows down henchmen by the hundreds its because 1 the huge gun is mounted on a truck 2 he is actually seen reloading it and 3 the gun is well armored so cheats death in a realistic way instead of movie magicwhat i didnt like was that the movie was maybe a bit uneven in that while it ends with an expected shootout the intensity of the final battle doesnt grow up to explode in a huge bang taken literally or not i was expecting something more now the most evil guy just tries to run away but collides with s knife end of movieanother thing that i didnt like was that the gore and violence was obviously cgi most of the time it just sticks out although when it worked  which was most of the time  it worked wellthe plot was just an excuse to find a place on earth where there could be a bunch of really evil guys and no rules what i liked was while you could think s motivation for fighting one more time was the captured woman missionary it was actually what she represented even without the returns home ending it is clear that there was no romance involved when the woman runs to her husband i guess adding a love interest was one of the three possible ways to ruin the movie also while you could say the characters were overall very thin it could be seen that at least they werent the usual brightly colored stereotypes this is s showthat said i wasnt disappointed the excess gore made me feel like secretly watching a very notforkids movie as a kid john was not a watereddown version of the original character did i mention the over the top violence was morbidly entertaining the movie was an extremely realistically drawn cartoon,cruel
as tag line says heroes never diethey just reload and this is trye he is back greatest action hero of eightiesjohn j the story follows well known john who is now older and lives in thailand and captures snakes and transports people and cargo in an old boat when a group of christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in burma to help the locals the reluctant only accepts when sarah miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission leaves the group in the requested location but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of major pa tee tint the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted later a member of their church meets and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries as you see script has a simple plot and is written in 80s style but it is more violent than almost any 80s action film there is blood everywhere stallones acting is of course bad but when he takes machine gun in his hands the fun begins sure this motion picture aint all time classic but it delivers what all of us expect from this kind of moviegreat fun and a lot of explosions and blood just seat back and enjoy,cruel
the ultimate warrior john is living peaceful and almost carefree in the mountains and jungles of northern thailand not exactly mundane john operates a longboat on the salween river and captures cobras and pythons for sale to snake fighters a group of missionaries arrive wanting to hire him to take them up river into wartorn burma after reluctantly delivering them with their medicine and religious materials they are captured by burmese national army soldiers john for the sake of one of the captured sarahjulie benz shifts into attack mode and ends up leading a team of mercenaries to the rescue the violence is grisly and extreme dont think about a body countit is more like a piece count graphic and bloody mutilations and all the trappings of war also in the cast graham mctavish tim kang paul schulze and maung maung khin,cruel
sylvester stallone i feel did a very good job in writing producing directing and acting in this movie something he has become accustomed to over the years the cg effects are not all that bad a lot of the cg is used for bodies exploding apart and whatever gore stallone could manage to throw in the plot is very simple maybe simpler than previous films and the rescue mission if you will is right on key its like this movie took the edge to the next level all the acting is very believable and the genocide scenes are horrifically exact a lot of brutality and blood flows in this film and this is definitely not a film for the light of heart take caution lighthearters i really feel that this movie should earn an award because it was so well done in comparison to the other films the score for the movie is great as well nice classical music that adds an eerie feeling to your gut while your watching it 8 out of 10 stars no problem,cruel
stallones 2008 version of is simply outstanding we waited twenty years for this movie to answer the questions left unanswered by 1988s iii and the answers are incredible has been living in thailand catching snakes for a living and living in denial over who he is his past has died on him all his friends are gone and all he has left is a boat and a way of eking out a poor living catching snakes for the snake shows when a group of missionaries go to to ask him about chartering his boat to get into burma s reply at first is a strong no but then one of the church group a woman named sarah asks him questions that make him question himself and before long he ferries them into burma all for the sake of the first real friend he has had in 20 years a encounter with some river pirates gets the action off into high gear and when is told the group has been taken by the local warlord the action turns white hot as leads a group of mercs into burma to rescue them the acting is solid stallone is well aware that helped give him a career when it was stalled after rocky ii he takes it seriously giving us a close up view of the atrocities happening in burma on a horrifying daily basis stallone does not flinch while showing us the horrors of burma and its because of that that succeeds so strongly we need a hero to go out and destroy that kind of evil and so we get to do what we want to see done deliver justice if reports are true and we can expect to see a 5 then we were just given a great start the acting is top notch and the action is white hot and the tension is strong during the battle scenes the movie is not your eighties version of its a whole new game and a whole new hes older wiser and he now knows who and what he is a warrior and this time hes accepted his destiny welcome him home by watching this movie its the least you can do for a honest to god larger then life reel hero,cruel
when i bought this movie on tuesday i had never seen it before i was a huge fan of the previous movies and was very excited about this one this film is an action packed thrill ride from beginning to end i had heard before from different reviews that this movie was so violent it was disturbing not true if you are a true war and action movie fan you will love it syl is great in this movie and you will never think to yourself man that guy is old for this he fits perfectly the dialog although sometimes cheesy is great the acting is good for an action movie and the violence is some of the greatest i have seen in recent action movies i was losing faith in action until this movie came out its great watch it,cruel
during this time of watered down sequels and fun for the family flicks we badly needed a throwback to the 80s  90s form of badass mindless action flicks so who are you gonna call john mcclane nope dirty harry wrong again the terminator please chuck norris maybe if he would get back into making those types of movies again our savior is john friggin this movie pulls no punches while managing to be extremely entertaining you almost forget the fact that hes 62 years old and he looks better than some young guys who would try a film like this there is no slick martialarts fighting or corny oneliners this is a depiction of the savagery of war and a glimpse of the cruel activities going on in burmathank you stallone for bringing us back to the good old days before political correctness took over before we were introduced to films that wouldnt dare go the extra distance to make a few bucks is by far the most entertaining action movie i have seen in years and i hope hollywood takes notice by giving us a trip back down memory lane more often,cruel
you know when you are watching a darn good film when you are desperate for the main character to show their skills when someone makes fun of them in this its the rubbish mercenary who makes fun of and throughout the bad mouthing i just thought oooooothat there is john also later on after makes his skills known to the mercenarys i was just waiting for a man to say who do you think you are but anyway the movie was incredible easily the best action picture ive seen in along time and i mean long time it was constantly entertaining i was so engulfed in the whole film i actually stayed while the ending credits went up just to see if he finally did meet his father i just wanted to see what happened and dare i say incredibly well shot for the ending though i felt the ending crept up on me from behind i was enjoying the film so much i didnt really want it to end just pure escapism but quality never the less some say hes lost it but i think hes finally starting to find itthe characters he works with have their unique little quirks but stallone stands out by far yet like any other film there are a few bits where you just thinkmm mmi dunno about that bit but honestly heres a film you can finally walk out a cinema saying im not to upset i paid 6 bucks to see that was damn worth it now adays its also rare for a young person to show a look of concern whilst watching a violent movie the village scene and the mine rice field scenestalk about heart pounding stuff but the shocker has to be when the child is thrown into the firei felt so in on the story i was drawn by the scenes of pure hellish evil stallone is skilled at building support for a character or theme rocky is another prime example of this stallone loves to get people behind the hero he loves to get people so involved rather than just to feel as though they are watching a movie think back to cliffhangerwere you not just praying from him to keep his grip soundtrackpure ambiance and atmosphere the titlethe theme when he stands triumphant at the end whilst looking over the destructiongeniusstallone actually lets the viewer feel proud of what they have seen done makes your hairs stand on end and a slight smile on your faceanyone who says stallone is not an actor needs a left hook look at and rocky is hardened and theoretically emotionless towards his actions where as rocky shows his feelings to his son adrian and even the boxing commission in rocky balboa one film for those who doubt his acting ability copland see ityoull be amazed at how talented stallone actually is hes passionate in all he does he puts a lot of time and sweat into his work he writes and directs he isnt afraid to take the boos which might come with it how many folk laughed when they heard about rocky 6 well im sure they are eating their own words now this man has truly came into his own hes now enjoying making films rather than concerning himself with his pocket money which i think shows in his work its more enjoyable for us as an audiencestallone is i think a real credit to the film industry he has brought in countless dollars through his movies hes created legendary characters and a hero to many how many people idolise or love rocky they dont love stallone they love the character he madethis man is like a great tasting wine he has improved through age and is finally letting us sample some of the unique and powerful flavours which lay in his vintage yet potent mindhail stallone,cruel
where do i begin with something that started when i was a kid obviously theres nostalgic reasons for wanting to see another movie starring sylvester stallone who has been an icon before this franchise startedup until now even if his recent movies hasnt given him the credit that he actually deserves s job is to lead a group of christians into the jungle with medical supplies followed by a group of mercenaries declines at first because of him being a marked man due to traumatic episodes from the war suddenly all hell breaks loose when they are being attacked by a group of soldiersthe story may not be fulfilling but the action value is on a very high level stallone is more than 60 years old but that doesnt really matter cause stallone doubled or should i say quadrilled on the violent sequences of brutality even small children dies bleeding from their faces as theyre getting stepped oninnocents being killed when soldiers makes a sadistic sport out of landmines i was really surprised by the the giant explosion in the jungle which activates and then avoids the bomb before it triggersi mean the rangeand the pressure of heavy sound effect i was blown awaystallone remembered to make some references to the previous movies from the giant franchiseeven the voice of richard crenna rip as colonel trautman this may be one of the few thing missing because they had such great chemistry the musical score is updated but he made sure to keep a theme for the score is very pounding whenever the fightsequences beginnote my primary objective is focused on the action cause on the acting level welllets just say that it is not too much of a character description we get in this one and the team of mercenaries didnt seem like good actorsnoall hails for pure action from the oldschool i was so focused of having back in action and i must admit even if it lacks some dept this movie makes up for it thanks to a great effort to make one of the most violent actionmovies of the year without compromising,cruel
iv was a violent and enigmatic devotion to the very bad place the killing fields of burma are this film showed stallone as the tool of todays global war machine i havent appreciated such reality of noir film since having to walk out on schindlers list sure its over the top action but was quenched cold prior to getting fired up all over again the emotions of fear bravery love and hate which drive us all are reemulated in john s past present and future was touched or ignited by again for once a nonromantic alliance these emotions sustain the audience throughout this movie and create a sustainable compliance and acceptance of s actions in reaching his next level of ascendancy stallone has supplied his audience with a successful and contemporary update of his past gorefests with intuition and consistency sly shows an older man who presents as even healthier faster and with even better haircheck out the cut in photos with arnold idbm iv could possibly kill over 100 people just to save one or four misguided souls s claymore sequence was unbelievable and fantastic and the photography gave you every visual and emotional aspect you needed to absorb such a large experience well done the photography was brilliant and often needs to be watched intensely just to comprehend what is being shown to you its all there i was miffed that the film was made in thailand i cant guess why the burmese bureaucracy would have issues with factors within this movie,cruel
a great effort from stallonewho directed and definitely ends the series on a high as an action film and a film it stands up well on both counts my score after one viewing is 7510 this places it second on my list behind first blood ill mention the negatives firstnegativesthe film was too short and seemed to have a chapter missing the way the christian aid workers just turned up asking to help them take them up the river to burma was done abruptly and pretty clumsily instead of starting with in the jungle catching snakes they could have started with the missionary workers making their way to s location with a bit of explanation of who they were and whether they had already heard of in the film the woman talks to as if she already knows him and these early scenes are overdramatised and get all heavy and pretentious when all she wants is a lift up the river these early exchanges werent the best in turn is portrayed as uninterested and unsympathetic and theres a brooding sense of oldman pessimism about him for me another negative was s opening line the first words that we hear from in nearly 20 years is an expletive hmmunfortunate but does set the harsh tone of the movielater the minister comes to inform of the groups disappearance and if he will escort a rescue team of mercenaries  this again echoed the scenario in 3 official turns up with the bad newscue involvement also a scene where the mercenaries are introduced to before setting off on the trip would have been far better than just instantly showing them altogether in the boat midriver the escape sequence through the jungle lacked a couple more action setpieces prior to the explosion of the big wwii bomb it would have been great to see for the last time taking on a couple of small units of enemy soldiers using his old survival skills in the junglei didnt like the british character who led the group of mercenaries supposedly exsas he seemed stereotyped basically a foulmouthed obnoxious ageing yob with a machine gun who would have looked more at home picking fights in a pub his introductory scene on the boat was overplayed and unrealistic given the dangerous circumstances as he was very hostile towards who was doing them a favour by escorting them upriver as the boatman although has other motives for making the trip i just wanted to knock him overboard for being so disrespectful but here a mature instead shows restraintlastly the ending was a touch weak and attempted to bring fullcircle and give some sense of closure to the series i thought this scene was just tackedon the endstallone appears quite older in this last scene without the headband and greasedback hair  and you know this is the end of the journey positivesactually there are some refreshing changes in this it could have been so easy for to go through the old favourite captured tortured escape and dish out retribution sequence but that wouldnt have been original and credit to stallone for not going down that old plotline we dont see a shirtless either muscles pumped doing the infamous roar as he peppers the enemy with dozens of rounds of bullets that wouldnt have looked right considering is a lot older also eventually fights as one of a group instead of the usual onemanonamission as he helps out the mercenaries in their quest to rescue the doomed missionariesi thought that s life was more in danger and that he was more vulnerable this was mainly due to his age  he was not portrayed as the invincible fighting machine of the past ironically though suffers the least physical injuries by far out of all the films a bullet to the shoulder his vast experience of conflictviolent situations does come through as he takes pretty much everything in his stride you wont see the classic shots of with his eyes wide open during moments of danger still has that smouldering pentup anger and when the time comes for him to kill he shows absolutely no mercy to the enemy who are real scum in this film the scene where he takes out the riverpirates was classic as a film in some ways is more true to the original first blood in that there is hardly any of the 80s cheesiness that was present in 2 and 3 and thankfully there is a lack of corny oneliners the absence of colonol trautman helped in this regard there is however a black and white flashback moment where various clips are shown mainly of the first two movies i didnt really like that as stallone did exactly the same in rocky balboa  its a blatant signing off montage of the franchisethe violence is intense and graphic and this has to be one of the bloodiest films of all time limbs various body parts can be seen flying around the screen it really is grim stuff and is backed up by the stat that it has the highest bodycount of all the movies yes does what he does best and takes out so many of the vile baddies its breathtaking action at its finest and is great to watch on the big screen if you are a fan im sure you will not be disappointed,cruel
this is a disturbing film the pure senselessness of the violence and horror of the poor burmese people living or more commonly not through the genocide depicted here was sickening to the bone this was more often than not not so much hollywood violence big explosions people just falling over when shot etc but rather a blown up in the photographic sense exaggerated version of the horrible reality of these situations ok so there were some relatively fun shots where peoples heads exploded to sniper fire but seeing someone vaporised by a mine they have been forced to risk treading on under the threat of being shot almost made me physically retch the film carries on in this vein for the majority of the first halfthere is little finesse to the fighting involving towards the end you get the feeling that silvester stallone is showing his age somewhat there are some good sequences though involving bow and arrows of course and right at the end with a machete but if youre going along purely to see stallone kick the enemy where it hurts in the way he did in the previous films you may be a little disappointedthis is not to say that the film is even remotely boring you will be on the edge of your seats for the vast majority of it if you arent puking your guts out in the bathroomone gets the feeling that the film is to an extent raising awareness of the situation in burma certainly not something that i have heard much about i have read up on the situation since i returned and all that i remember of the facts stated at the beginning of the film are true most recent news i found was the obituary of the assassinated rebel leader man sha la phan take a look at the following link for more on thathttpwwwguardiancoukworld2008feb18burma the fact that the film is staying so close to the facts stating them in such a straightforward and almost understated way backed by what appears to be real footage from burma rather than trying a sensationalist piece of propaganda brings it credibility as something more than a mindless action film it certainly sent me away thinking i fear though that to todays desensitised western audiences the conversations i overheard on the special effects and the amount of blood in the scenes may outweigh the talk about the atrocities being committed however if just a few more people are moved into action by this piece of cinema it may be enough to persuade governments to do something for people who need itodeon have apparently boycotted the film which have definitely hurt its take here in the uk at least at the cinema and it appears that the boycott has more to do with personal relations with sony i suspect that dvd sales may make up for this loss though as this is an outstanding work of cinematography no matter the genre for more on the odeon snub follow the following link httpodeonfeed24comgo51787373 overall a fantastic film if horribly graphic and certainly worth a watch despite its short length only about 80 mins or so not for the squeamishjasper,cruel
in his fourth bloodsoaked cinematic outing ageing vietnam veteran john sly stallonenow a reclusive reptilewrangling boatowner in thailandreluctantly agrees to ferry a group of christian aid workers into neighbouring wartorn burma after the biblebashing dogooders are kidnapped by a ruthless military unit joins a team of hardbitten mercenaries on a dangerous rescue mission and proceeds to slice dice maim mutilate and kill anyone who gets in his wayan hourandahalf of graphic carnage culminating in one of the most brutal and bloody battle scenes ever committed to celluloid is a bulletridden actionfest designed to please moviegoers who cant be bothered with unnecessary rubbish such as a complex plot or character development stallones latest effort may use the troubles in burma as its backdrop but dont expect meaningful political commentary once it has been established that burma is bad news for tourists it is relentless death and destruction for the duration and i wouldnt have it any other wayvisually the film is stunning and directorstar sly does a great job with the action using fast frantic handheld camerawork combined with blinkandyoullmissem moments of nasty gore in which heads explode guts are spilled and bodies are blown to smithereens using a convincing mix of prosthetic and cgi effects mindless movie violence doesnt get much more gratuitous or realistic than thisit is true as some of its critics claim that the lack of depth in s narrative means that the film only appeals on a totally superficial level but surely the fact that slys movie averages 259 killings per minute more than makes up for that,cruel
nostalgic touching realistic and very unafraidthis is a bold statement and a very necessary one i cant stop watching it those who disapprove fair enough but i grew up with sincere love for these kind of films and until nowi thought they didnt make em like this anymore and this has a gritty fresh take on it too it had a new take on the character himself you can really sympathise with this jaded sad man a result of past sadness and horror this man isnt cheesy apart from where necessary and you can feel his pain through this honest deliverythe score was moving it played on the old films very well but only touched on them a little and offered something new as well the emotional score really tugged the heart stringsi recommend anyone to watch this at the cinema as we owe it to the director and everyone involved in making the filmand not only was it touching but it also illustrated part of what war is like in real life i am not a burma expert but if that is the way some things are over there then this film has started a small fireand if the goingson in that film are a reflection of reality then i hope pressure amountsstallone my hat is off bring on number 5 sir,cruel
when i first heard of a 4th film in the series i wasnt interestedthe third one wasnt even that good when i first seen it twenty years ago and there had been so much in between 3 and the now proposed sequelthen i seen the two rough cut trailers that had everyone talkingsince then i have read the various posts on imdb throughout the last year regarding the fourth entry in the seriesthe more i read the more interested i became in the new film maybe it was a slight touch of nostalgia or just the need for something more hard hitting in the action genre that i personally think has been sadly lacking from most releases came out in the us a month before the uk and i slightly spoiled the movie for myself by reading reviews and various discussions on the new filmjust last night i viewed and all i can say is the new film was terrific the overall feel that is expected from a film is present and correct with the violence at an all time highmaybe its just me but for the first time since first blood the story gives more depth and outline to the character this film feels like the one and only true sequel to first blood the 2nd and 3rd movies are still canon but personally i think that everyone involved in this new were aiming for a far more realistic and believable story than we had in the previous 2 movies in the series obviously the film has had its critics but if your reading this all i can say is be your own criticthe film has flaws dont all films but this does exactly what it says on the tin lean mean with no flabby sections that bog down the storytelling no stupid in depth explanations to bore and confuse the viewer just another chapter in the characters existenceenjoy it i certainly did as for all those who moaned that it was too short i again personally think it was just the right lengthas for the ending for some it has given closure to the series for others it is a new door open for one final filmi would like one more set on s own turf just one more square go with whatever baddies come his way i give it a good solid 7 out of 10 i dont think there are any 10 out of 10 films for someone who originally wasnt interested in a fourth film i have had a real turn around and have once more begun to enjoy regards the dug,cruel
i had been waiting on tenterhooks for the release of this movie since i heard it was to be made i really was not disappointedfirst of all lets get the bad points out of the way i think most people will agree stallone is by no means one of the great actors of our time as is shown throughout most of the film as his dialogue is mumbled in a pretty incoherent manner as usual i suppose and some of his conversations with the missionaries were just plain confusing also i thought the film was too short this may just have been because it was a blast and time flies when your having fun but although it ended on a nice note something just felt unfinished to mebut noone should go to see this film in hope of enthralling discourse or truly outstanding acting although graham mctavish in particular was quite good this film was all about the excitement that a fan of the series would have come to expect and really delivers all of the battle scenes are really top notch the special effects are truly something to behold and make for some very gory but entertaining and to some degree more realistic actionthere is also a political perspective that comes across very strongly especially in the opening five minutes of the film about the atrocities occurring in burma and i feel that not only will you come away feeling entertained but hopefully more aware of the situation in this war torn country personally i have to admire stallone and monterastelli for trying to bring this situation into the public eyein short though this is everything an action film should be it has been a while since i have been to the cinema and come out feeling like i really got my moneys worth but i was truly impressed by this possibly last venture of one of the true great action heroes of all time,cruel
this is one of the greatest action movies i have ever seen credit to stallone he has done done a fantastic job directing and writing this movie action movies of the 80s where second to none stallone brings that back to life in fantastic form the last die hard hard and terminator were poor because they where not 18 r rated movies like the first ones stallone keeps this promise here and he does a suburb job violent fast and just plain great and a good old 90 minute movie for people who respect a great action movie this is for u it dont get any better than this its took years for anyone to make this sort of movie like this again rocky balboa was a great ending and hes done ever better here but i have a feeling the story is not over yet stallone is a acting and directing legend full stop,cruel
well he did an admirable job on rocky and now he does it again hes not a oneman army this time and thats all to the good the english soldiers are great in this they cracked me up the only real hole in proceedings is the church guy turning up and bankrolling the mercenaries i didnt believe that really but it does not spoil things and even very serious films have the odd plot hole without ruining the wholethis made me want to know more about the real situation in burma so for me its not just a bulletfest though its obviously an excellent example of that doesnt say much but hes not ridiculously taciturn either he weighs his words and he speaks when he has something to say fair enoughas some others have said there is some strong stuff in this though i would say the editing helps a bit by not lingering too much on any particular act too long most horror films make me feel sicker than this did and i dont think anything here is sickforthesakeofit you are meant to be horrified by what people do to others its a good test of your desensitization to violence if youre not shocked or at least dismayed then yes there is something wrongdespite what many critics will probably say of this this is not a turn your brain off violent load of crap its a good fast pacy action film and in many surprising ways it may make you think a littleaction films are not my absolute favourite but this is simply very good i hope things change one day in burma at least stallone shines a light on it before we all forget,cruel
impressive its already been said stallone is back and up to the legend its unnecessary to be one of his fans to enjoy this movie its an hardboiled and heavily action packed movie with great visuals musics and sfx except for a few surprisingly bad onesi never enjoyed the sequels of first blood but this one blows away the two previous bad movies and keep the only thing that was good with them  wild commando actionits not as good as first blood but at last the main character is the same a tormented and antisocial survivor of the vietnam war haunted by horrible memories and hardly containing the beast of anger within his blood the film is really violent its been a long time since ive seen such a bloody mess in a movie i guess the closest examples are the first and last scenes from saving private ryan some will enjoy  some others wont  i loved every single bit of it  of course the movie is far more violent than the fist one and its not as unique and clever but its a really great adventure which uses the clich to its best when you think of what comes first to your mind is a big strong guy roaring on a battlefield and firing at dozens of enemies with a machinegun  well thats what youll get with this movie an better than in any movie of the same kind but youll also have a cleverly built yet quite simple scenario with good characters and a fantastic john greatly interpreted by stallone close to the great and tormented character he was at first a mustsee for every fan and a good action movie for the others,cruel
just wanted to say a few things stallone did it right in every way possible most of the actionwar movies that we see today are watered down in order to sell the most possible tickets they totally miss the chance to portray war in the truly horrible brutally violent and the unfortunately necessary reaction to said brutality the way that stallone did any other way is a disgrace to those that have seen real war and fought for theirs and others lives reading the possible plots that stallone mulled over for this fourth installment of hostage crisis at the un or white supremacist taking his wife and child hostage both of which would have been ok but the plight of the burmese people was the perfect choice and the only one that john could have been realistically used for i have talked with a few friends that thought the film showed to much brutality yet i explained my view that if you are going to portray the real life slaughtering of the burmese people by a ruthless military you better be honest about it i believe that was the reason stallone chose this storyline part entertainment part hay guess what kind of horrible things can happen if no one is there to fight back notice how most of the mercenaries seemed to be the usual movie clich characters the british sas that never shut up and complained endlessly the tattooed man and the guy who sang constantly i think that was stallones nod to those unrealistic characters and situations that current movies keep cranking out and i think that was the real reason that never said a word to them on the boat ride they didnt deserve to be acknowledged the only complaint i have about the movie is that the group of christian missionaries could not have been that ill informed about what was going on in burma and after the attempt on their lives from the burmese pirates they still didnt get a clue to the hell they were in for i just dont believe they could have been that dense it does no good to help heal someone if they are just going to be murdered had it right if your not taking any weapons your not going to change anything you can talk and negotiate all you want but if all the other guy wants to do is kill you then there really is no other recourse you gotta ize them,cruel
john is the greatest man in the history of the universe this movie was everything i had hoped it would be and more i always considered my bloodlust to be insatiable but found myself leaving completely satisfied my only complaint would be that it is over and i am still not watching it society owes a great deal of acclaim to sylvester stallone for creating this epic spectacle of carnage i go to see dramatic films to see good story telling and truly believable character acting i go to action movies to see outlandish stunts and supreme levels of violence needless plot development only takes valuable time away from machinegunning infantry and arrows through the face thank you mr stallone for reintroducing me to the action movie genre well done sir,cruel
ive just got home from the cinema and i can say that i was stunned brought my childhood memories back to life when i was watching first three parts several times a month  now after 20 years after 3 has been released i can say that stallone did a great job both as an actor and a producer this movie is too violent maybe the most violent of all ive watched although im not a fan of violent movies but then again this is nevertheless action scenes and movie effects are stunning in this part this is definitely the best part of series and i would recommend it to anyone who like action movies or is just a fan movie soundtrack is also good just as good as it was in the first three partsthumbs up,cruel
when i went to see this movie i was not expecting much from it other than entertainment value however i was wrong this movie was awesomei wouldnt recommend this movie for all audiences due to the graphic violence and trust me without giving anything away here the violence is very graphic the story line was very solid to me it appeared that stallone had put a lot of research into the film and the direction of the film was excellentif you are looking for an all out action movie with a great story i highly recommend this last installment of the sequels i give this an 810,cruel
probably the only true sequel to first blood and another step from the wilderness for sylvester stallone as a filmmaker while not as good as the last rocky film it is a decent action film that is a bit troubling in the level of its violencethe plot has in thailand being hired to take a bunch of missionaries up stream into war torn burma at first reluctant to do so he sees the trouble ahead he is talked into it by sarah who convinces him thats its better to die for something than live for nothing when the missionaries go missing the head of the church the missionaries came from hires to take some mercenaries to where he left the first group not one to sit behind once more finds himself in the thick of the battlequite simply one of the most graphically violent war films ive ever seen blood and body parts fly freely it is almost too much to take which is sad since in five years its violence will probably be the norm trust me on this if blood and broken bodies bother you dont see this film its effect is very visceral becoming a real punch in the stomach amazingly stallone manages to keep the body count high and not lose its effect something many over the top war films fail to achievewhat troubles me is the films moral center is not clear while its clear that stallone and do not feel violence is never good a sentiment expressed by one of the characters its bothersome to wonder at what point is it too much violence i dont think the film knows and so it tries and on some level succeeds to hedge its bets i think it works only because there is so much blood and carnageas there probably would be in a battle of this sort that you are kind of forced to ponder the implications of it allof course i could be reading too much into itas an action film this is a pretty good popcorn film it moves at a good clip isnt too long about 90 minutes and isnt really that lost in reagan era jingoistic politics come on the second and third films are laughably bad as are many of stallones films from the same timeif you like action films i say give it a shot65 to 7 out of 10,cruel
ok there were many action movies in the past years and yes indeed they were crap they relied on one crappy 10million dollar scene showing how bullet on slow motion hits something or how a building collapses and that was it you watch a movie you think its action movie and you have 80 minutes of crap one minute of final battle scene and nine minutes of dramatic ending but i would say there is god for us action movie lovers is it yestruly great action movie truly not a single moment of time stretching not a single moment of bulk just action pure and clear and the battles oh my amazing bloody expressionistic naturalistic all you need from that kind of movie no there are not censored i want to watch with my sonny who doesnt need to watch blood battle scenes they are as real as they can get the blood is spilling the skulls are shattered the insides are out and the limbs are disconnected and that is what matters but the great thing comes besides that that the movie possesses nice storyline as for action movie the acting is good not high class of course but it fits great the soundtrack is just in place as well there is no time wasting as i mentioned the movie starts the movie goes and ends and everything is where it should be no we have a nice 1minute 100 million dollar last scene we made the whole movie for attitude quite the contraryas for ending i would just say one thing amazing,cruel
the fourth movie in the films outdoes all the other three and stands bold and firm among other action films after the success from rocky balboa stallone could only get better and thats the exact case in this scenario he may not be the greatest actor in the world but stallone remains one of the greatest action figures of our time his best coming from it excludes the three other petty films before it and becomes a daring disturbing and magnificent epicaction movies these days cant really grab the thrill excitement and adrenaline but this is by far not the case with sly delivers fast paced action bloody brutal and in your face its that type of film that nobody under the age of 18 should ever watch each act of violence significantly gets 100 times more brutal including the classic stallone finale but taken above the violence is in fact a real emotional story think of it like the first rocky film but without the gloves and a hell of a lot more violencethink of it like the first rocky film but without the gloves and a hell of a lot more violencesly stallone is still here and has reinvented the action movie as we know it,cruel
for those who have constantly complained about ol sly stallone returning to write and direct another installment in his two biggest franchises rocky and you can stop your complaining now maybe you were disappointed in december 2006 when rocky balboa was released and ended up being as bad as everyone expected however it is the not the same with stallones newest despite the negative reviews and the harsh feedback is exactly what an action movie is during its 93 minute duration an estimated 276 persons are killed in a wide variety of ways from machete to 50 cal to bow and arrow to claymore to flamethrower to mortar etcthe film starts with a brief rundown of the recent violent history of burma projecting horribly gruesome images of burned decapitated and mutilated humans shortly after a scene is shown in which captured natives are forced to make their way across a marsh where landmines are hidden two minutes later the opening credits project the unforgettable 80s font that display the title we find our hero john living the simple life in vietnam helping natives and doing what he can when a group of americans on a mission from their church request s help traveling up river to burma at first refuses telling the group it is a violent and dangerous war zone the churchgoers continue to plead for s help until he finally resentfully gives in during their voyage the group runs into some violent military patrolmen this is where we get the first glimpse of s abilities in this newest installment when the zealots say they still want to continue north continues the journey and lets them off at the edge of the village when believes them to be safely doing their job he hears news that something went wrong and the religious group has gone missing now has thrown himself into a gruesome mission to find the missing and unleash graphic terror onto their captors the next 40 minutes consist of the deaths i listed priorfirst off ignore my rating adding everything into the equation acting directing editing script etc the film would average out to about a 7 however i did not go into this movie awaiting a genius plot or an oscar winning screenplay i mean stallone did write the movie i went in awaiting multiple explosions and nonstop action believe me my money was not wasted is exactly what an action movie should be this is the model action movie average duration r rating graphic carnage a veteran actor simple plot terrible script the film is truly not as bad as the critics say it is my advice do not miss this movie rather it be in theaters or on dvd is extremely entertaining and well worth the time you will probably even find many humorous moments as well,cruel
after the long gap series is back to put the series in the correct spot in the action genre you guessed it right top spotsly did a good job as the director cleverly capturing the gritty realism of war in somewhat shocking way movie is extremely fast paced once the action starts it only stops near creditsstory is good  in action movie terms especially i liked the way he developed the villain  you really fell hatred for them cast fit perfectly so want to watch an awesome action movie should be your choice 8 out of 10,cruel
first excuse me for my bad broken englishi loved the 80s and was one of the icons of my teen age so my expectations from this movie were very high and i was not disappointed stallone made a great work closing the circle of the story of this disturbed veteran in first blood we know that he became a drifter because he was unable to adapt himself to civilian life maybe seeking for an answer this is summarized when he is resting and having one of many nightmares of his past life after the meeting with the minister he finds this answer you didnt kill for your country you killed for yourself  so dont search a pretext for your problems in your fellow countrymen that never cheered you when you came back from the nam or an excuse for your killings in patriotism you did it because you liked it because youre a killing machine so lets do what you are born for and leave the damn snakes live their lifestallone made a beautiful work bringing back in the places where he belongs a jungle in some south asian forgotten country i mean fk the damn boring desert and the annoying terrorists is made for buldozering vietnameselike nasty armies in the jungle with an arrow and a knife no better with a tarantinofashioned machete  there is so much in this movie that reminded me of the classic war movies that i use to like the element of the river for example do you remember apocalypse now  you can see the scene of the boat inspection reversed here with a first bit of the brutality and efficiency of the beast inside giving the last shot to the wounded pirate like goodol captain willard did to the girl some wars ago the burmese army camp is so deer hunter like the wooden cages the pigs the soldiers having fun torturing and raping prisoners then there is at his best some people complained that there is not a lot of action and weaponry used by but i liked the way stallone came back to the first movie uses what he finds on the field and he uses his mature age skill to own the rest of the armed people around this includes the dirty dozen australian mercenaries that awake to real life warzone just seconds before dying looking at the testosterone pumped old fart while making the right use of a 50 caliber gun make big holes into things the last view we have of in a battlefield his expression show us that its all done he had enough he has seen the same scene a lot of times and he found the answer now its time to go back home the last scene of the movie is so right now dressed with the same jeans and military jacket of the first movie now unflagged looks at the road then to what is supposed to be home and choose home the end of the roada last note i gave the movie 810 for two reasons should be really right at his age with a lot more of grey hairs showing better that aging means nothing for the beast inside him and the other reason is that there is more to be shown and probably ill see what is missing in the dvds directors cut in a couple of years sigh if you havent done it yet take a look at the rrated trailer the point of views are different from the movie and it is a little masterpiece by himself,cruel
hes 60 in real life and in the film it looks like he could be that age as well so why at the end of the movie does he go see his his father shouldnt his dad be dead he must be 90100 years old and also why is everyone going on about the blood and gore so what ill just rent or buy a slasher movie if wanted that also of course this is not believable a 60 year old man against a burmese army and he wins he did not even die at the end of the film which made me even more depressed i just thank god that i heard an interview that this film was it for sylvester stallone which makes me think if harvey weinstein really wants another sequel then they are either going to arecast which is stupid or b they are going to do something stupid like make the son of or some crap like that,cruel
i have always been a big fan of i ii and iii i just watched iv tonight 26jan2008 and it is nothing like the other movies in the series first of all iv was difficult to watch just because of the constant shaking of the camera and because of fastforwarding during parts of the action sequences is this supposed to be artistic or something it sucks other than technical issues the entire movie was completely tasteless there was scarcely any plot far too much profanity and the violence was unnecessarily much more graphic than in the first three movies sylvester stallone did his job well  he was still the same and he had a cool knife the other actors were awful i worked in special operations forces for several years and the foul language that my coworkers used was nothing compared to that of the soldiers in this film what is the point in using so much profanity i considered walking out so my fianc wouldnt have to listen to it  it was that bad in the other movies the violence consisted mostly of fiery explosions arrow and knife penetrations handtohand combat and clever vietnam style booby traps at least some of which was left to the imagination in this movie they went out of their way to make each scene as exaggeratedly gory as possible through plain senseless violence in all but a few instances this movie should disgust and offend everyone,cruel
really cant see whats different or new about this instalment of the series all the films involve him slowly revealing just how much of a badass superelite soldier he is yet in this film apart from showing strong leadership skills and an aversion to any kind of poetry in death he does very little that anyone of us whos ever played a first person shooter computer game would be very impressed with who amongst us couldnt kill loads of generic enemy soldiers with a heavy machine gun no the only really impressive thing about him is the endless silences every time anyone asks him a question just ignoring people is the very essence of power that is unless as i suspect the whole time he is trying to think of a really clever response but cant and just decides to say nothing at all in fact i think if you reexamine all the films that is exactly what always happens hed like to be able to say something clever he tries really hard to think of something clever to say he realizes he cant so he shoots  kills not great for character development there is none in fact beyond one christian espousing pacifism one moment before seeing the light and pounding out someones brains with a rock the next indeed watching this film is a little bit like doing the same for yourself only with a dense piece of celluloid instead,cruel
why imdb is decreasing the points of it started with 88now its 79i just wanna ask these imdb employees that why u people just hate stallonethey want to do the same to this movie what they have done to other stallone movieswhy dont you respect this gentlemandont you know the importance of film like why you only respect the actors who are only popular in usdont you know stallones popularity worldwidejust compare it with your favorite actors and then you will come to know the power of stallone dont you know about the popularity of worldwidei would like 2 ask to imdb employees that anyone of them had the guts to make a movie like john i know they dont have n its very difficult 2 make such moviesjust see the hard work put 2 show everything realistic in this movieamazingviolent but realistic,cruel
ive heard a lot good stuff about this movie and i thought ive to watch it to be sure mr sly you have ed the screen and they say the man is old man you still rock and still nr1 action figure this is a masterpiece coming from a master 4 is the movie that takes you back to old times great action that it has fade away since this new era of digitalized action a lot of special effects and a very complicated and many times not understandable plots this masterpiece of has a very simple story but thats its strength it has an old concept of row action but thats the special about it and thats what makes it great the genius act of sly and the whole crew and the excellent plot takes you back to the very first movie many people have complained about the roughness in this movie i tell you people the roughness in the movie its a kind of a description of the rage against the mercilessness in the world and in that specific place on earth its the s feelings against those killers whove killed and raped many children and womenthis movie is definitely a 10 stars one and i recommend everybody who wants to relive the 80s good days action to watch it and enjoy it,cruel
if youre like me and obviously tons of others on here and liked all of the movies the first time you saw them and maybe not so much the second time this one is worth seeingonce the bad not so badits definitely not an upgrade from any previous installment its just the next one or possibly the last the dialog is very stalloneesque lots of cheesy tag lines that sometimes hit and sometimes miss but tolerable if you keep your expectations realistic again its a stallone moviethe character development is pretty poor with the main character jumping into a trusting relationship w the female lead the instant he makes eye contact without any real explanation as to why the chemistry between these two was virtually nonexistent but this was probably due to just poor writing more so than casting issues you could have replaced stallone with pick your favorite male actor and none of the scenes between these two characters would have stood a chancethis may have also been a product of the very fast pace of the film as it really jumps right into the action but it wasnt a very long movie so they could have done it a little more justice by making it somewhat believable i think they did a better job with this in first blood oki didnt say a perfect jobthe good still even with the flaws above i really enjoyed this flick im not much of a blood and guts fan but this team really put together a shocking and graphic representation of war with all of the bits and pieces i was smiling in amazement of how realistic everything looked and ashamed at the same time for grinning at something so violent forget hamburger hill and saving private ryan takes the cake for carnage believe me though its more of a testosteroneinduced roller coaster ride than a politicallycharged social commentary you dont walk out of the theatre feeling depressed and selfreflective but rather justified in even the most flawed of your masculine attributes and ready to kick some buttisnt that what action movies are all about,cruel
after the stunt stallone pulled by making another great rocky movie imho the best since rocky i i was very thrilled about another installment however after seeing the movie all i can be is disappointed first of all this is the first movie where uses the fword im not against swearing but its not something would do he never used the fword in the first three movies and now says stuff like fk the world secondly his trademark weapon is not in the movie wheres the cool knife why did they leave it out thirdly and most important wheres the story this movie is like a rerun of first blood part ii but with the plot left out a he does is go to camp kill over 200 people most of the from standing on the same spot with a machinegun and then go back home thats it nothing more take that and the fact that all characters in this movie a complete stereotypes and there you have the recipe for a complete disaster might not be expendable but this movie sure is ps i do hope that potential 5 is going to be made so the series has a better ending instead of this piece of crap,cruel
well what can i sayi just returned from seeing for the 3rd timethis is truly an amazing film not only because it has kick ass action but great and touching story alsostallone proves to be not only a great actor but a skilled director alsohe tells a story which is quite scary but also true and happens in modern day burmaive read that the soldiers there are savagesmonstersstallone captures this sad and heart tearing reality and transports it well on filmmenwomen and children are killed with no remorse in the most disturbing ways imaginablethe savages even throw mines into the swamps and bet who of the captive people will survive while running in feara shocking reality but sadly true at the same timenow to get to the real partthe actionand what an action it ispeople get teared apart to pieces when shotit was made so realthe violence here was crossing the nc17 line but thats why it was greatand is the manhe shoots people with arrows through the bodies and headshe chops headshe rips throatsturns people to paste with a huge machine gun big enough to level a house to the groundthere is also a big kick ass explosion with a pretty nice blast wave that destroys quite a bit of junglethe final 20 minutes are the best when grabs the machine gun and kills dozens of soldiershes assisted by a skilled sniper who blows heads like balloonsthe main bad guy is a real piece of worka twisted homo child molesterbut he gets whats commin to himstabs than opens his belly till the intestines fall outoverall is the best movie ive seen in a long time and in my top 10 action movies of all timebe sure to check this movie in the theater it has the best sound that will blow your ears away,cruel
ive always been a huge fan of although the intriguingly complex character has since become a clich of sorts jokingly referred to in the tail end of jokes the series began to falter a little with 3 and the character fell into obscurity now ill be the first to admit that i laughed at the idea of stallone revisiting the character as well as rocky i was proved wrong with rocky balboa as that was a very good film and im proud to say that sly is 2 for 2 with we find completely removed from the world living how he wants to live content with being away from everything similar in premise to 3 while trying to avoid fighting he is inevitably pulled back into it but its how he comes to fight that is different from all times past in first blood he has no other choice not expecting a war at home and not looking for one war is declared on him for all the wrong reasons and his switch is turned on immediately in first blood part 2 hes asked to go back to the hell called vietnam to rescue forgotten pows and is betrayed once again in 3 his mentor and the only man he trusts trautman is captured behind enemy lines and hes the only one willing and able to go in and save himin this final installment as of right now an older colder john has given up on the world and for good reason and just wants to live out the rest of his life in whatever kind of peace he can achieve this time its christian humanitarians who seek his help getting into burma to provide medical relief learning that theyre traveling without weapons in the wartorn country he essentially laughs at their cause telling them that theyre in no position to change anything and doesnt want to be a part of it hes later convinced to help them by the only female in the group who reaches the only human part of his soul left he does help them only to learn that theyve been captured by the burmese hes pulled into war once againonly this time he finally comes to the understanding that he can no longer fight what he truly isa killer a warrior who wasnt just trained as such by the green berets but who he always was from the beginning one line really struck and also surprised me you didnt kill for your country you killed for yourself i found this very interesting as i never did get this from the character he was bred as a killing machine and always wanted to turn it off but never could what learns is that he was always a killer and he did what he did for himself not his countrythat he went to vietnam to kill to afghanistan to killfor himself this is very telling that is truly a cursed soulwhat follows is one of the most gruesome brutal actionwar films ever made straight to the point inyourface action holding nothing backthe images and happenings are as cold stern and bold as s aged faceand it all works wonderfully people tend to forget just how talented stallone is and its so pleasing to see that at age 62 he still has it not only physically but mentally still with great knowledge of how to do an action film he is indeed a mastermy hats off to him while everyone laughed at sly when they learned there was going to be another rocky movie and another moviehe proved everyone wrong myself included and i couldnt be happier whether or not theres another movie after this wouldnt matter to me john finally came full circle with himself as well as his characters realization for his fans any doubt that action movies are dead look no further stallone still got it is one of the years best910,cruel
alright last night i had some time to kill so i went to check out the new after seeing the latest edition of rocky i was a little concerned that it would probably be a little slow and the stallone was getting a little old well all i can say is this is not the case at all he proved he still has it and i left happier than i have in a while after seeing a movie this is by far the best action movie i have saw in very long time i go to the movies all the time sure i see some people complain it is violent and gory but come on it is what did you expect when you sat down to watch it if you want an action packed movie that will have you leaving the movie theather hyped up then this is the movie for you as for the people who gave this movie bad reviews all i can say is get a life and quit finding the bad in everything,cruel
it was such a relief to finally see a movie that had clear good and bad guys many films today have convoluted characters who are neither good nor evil but have a mix of qualities what many people forget is that in this world there are good people and there are very evil people as well the truth is that directors who dont show this are simply unrealistic sometimes you just want to watch the good guy kick butt saving the damsel in distress as well is a nice bonus also you cant forget that is an american classic overall 1010keep em coming,cruel
sylvester stallone should be lauded for coming through with a great action movie in an age when action genre is nothing more than pretty boys with collection of stunsthink bourne identity mission impossible here is an old school action star showing everybody how to make a 100 pure violent action movie the bad guys are just plain evil with no crazy gimmicks or gadgets they are just plain mean sobs is our relentless hero who always comes through and delivers the justice in his own violent manner i remember a while ago i was watching 2 and thinking to myself that they just dont make action movies like they used to stallone made this movie for action fans who have been longing for some pure violence without any gimmicks or complex plot lines good guys on one side the bad guys on the other and when it is all said and done only one man will still be standing enjoy the movie it sure is a good one,cruel
i went into this movie with high hopes and stallone surpassed them i thought this movie was simply amazing and i had to watch it again me and a group of friends i went to the theater with watched two back to back showings of this film and happily forked over 13 to do it im 26 years old and my friends are 19 23 and 33 we all left the theater with ear to ear grins on our faces once the action starts about 30 mins into the movie it never lets up most movies give you a chance to catch your breath between all the explosions and dead bodies but gives you 30 minutes of character development followed by over an hour of non stop killing my estimated body count in this movie is around 200  250 kills do yourself the favor and see it in theaters i would have never forgiven myself if i had passed this one up,cruel
the only word that can describe this movie is action if you did not enjoy this film you are either a a person who does not understand the definition of awesome b someone trying to make the majority angry or c missing a brainthis is hands down the best action movie since equilibrium and will probably hold the tittle for years to come some things about action movies that people do not understand it is action i didnt go to see ramdo and expect someone to recite shakespeare in a heartwarming voice to a beautiful plot line that pulled me into a sea of tears i went to see an action movie to see st explode and oh my god i feel like i should have paid double to see this film it was that greatgreat ending to a great idea stalone is the man even at age 60 he looks like a tank he is so torn you could chizzle his absone more thing complaint about one liners and messages one liners ruin movies and if you didnt catch it there was a message in this film religion can not solve anything but pure muscle can,cruel
in this installment is somewhere in the jungle minding his own business catching snakes that he sells to the locals who use it for their business apparently hes isolated himself completely from civilization but sometimes life still comes to find you so is reluctantly hired to take a band of missionaries into burma where they intend to help the people of this war torn area now people this is where it gets very graphic and thats approximately 5 minutes into the film i think most people know that there is a high level of violence in this movie but this is saving private ryan type stuff only in vivid color lots of people get blowed up so if thats not what you want to see please dont go into this film and then come out of it angry and tell everyone that the movie is terrible thats the whole point of this movie and its like that for the entire movie onto the acting no need for acting theres no time its just action plus action with action stallone looks good but we already knew that there is none of that characteristic screaming or any of that just a man getting it done i believe that its realistic in its portrayal of what happens in a war type situation there are people fighting all over the world and this is happening everyday just because it usually gets cleaned up for the evening news doesnt mean this level of bloodshed isnt happening this movie makes you happy that you dont live in one of those places it also makes you want to find out exactly what is going on there and why i dont think this will be the last we see of mr stallone seems to be saying something with his films now and im guessing hes going to have more to say through john ,cruel
if you have any sense for selfrespect for your own sight avoid this rubbish at any costtruly ridiculous story with equally idiotic lines everything in service of complete and meaningless pornographic violence that serves no other purpose than to attract even more violencein this charade strikes me as someone who borrowed the wrong plastic mask from mickey rourke with equal wisdom of completely emphatic and silly linesneedles to say that this be the most violent ever in fact it redefines the violence as reason to employ this stupidity of the story everything platform oriented everything in one single day in the latest hollywood fashion of nonstop action zero responsibility zero intelligenceanyone with an ounce of professional integrity should be embarrassed to even be mentioned with this movieavoid this garbage at any cost,cruel
posing as an actionadventure sequel in the famous series is much more a spoof of itself than a drama our story starts when john is living in abject filth and poverty earning a living by going upriver in what looks like the same boat used in the african queen he earns his living by capturing snakes and selling them to a local entrepreneur who does some form of snake show as has been the case in other sequels in this franchise has lost all faith in life that is until a comely dogooder julie benz of dexter convinces him to take her dogood posse to warravaged burma they get captured and mercenaries are hired to determine if theyre still alive and to get them out joins the mercenaries no need for spoilers hereanyone whos read this far knows the ending already replete with dialog that could sink the titanic the unintentional comedy never stops highlight of the the spoof is when the mercenaries synchronize watches all have standard issue military watches not penniless john hes suddenly sporting a panerai luminor i started laughing so hard in the theater that i thought i would get thrown out i am amazed at the positive reviews this film has received on this site you can enjoy the film only if you properly manage expectations,cruel
2008  out of 4 sylvester stallones comeback continues with this fourth film in the series which we last saw twentyyears earlier this time out is living in thailand when he is asked to take a group of christian aid workers to the wartorn burma everything goes as expected until an evil infantry unit kidnaps the aid workers so must gear up to try and bring them back alive obviously if youre looking for some sort of art film or some deep serious message about burma then youre out of luck because this is just an outright overthe top graphic and at times hilarious action movie that doesnt hold back at anything and really delivers every single good that it possibly has to offer im really not sure how much money stallone or the studio had to pay the mpaa from keeping this away from an nc17 rating but the violence here is just so incredibly graphic gory and over the top that i found myself laughing throughout the entire film and im not saying that in a bad way most of the pg13 rated action films of today are just simply boring and not worth much so it was very refreshing getting back to the good old days when it was okay to be politically incorrect and have fun being that way im not sure how many bodies get piled up here but thank god stallone went all out and made sure the viewer had fun yes there are many logical problems but so what youre watching an action film im usually against the use of cgi effects but stallone uses them very well here with the exception of one explosion scene and since the gore is so over the top the cgi actually helps them the action is pretty much nonstop from the getgo which of course is another great thing there seems to be some controversy about the serious nature of the true events against this wildly violent movie but i really wouldnt pay it too much attention there are subtle ways stallone shows the horrors that are happening to the innocent people and then there are graphic and gory ways of killing off the bad people if people are sensitive then they might want to skip this but im sure stallone wasnt making this movie for those people anyways with this film and rocky balboa its clear that stallone is at the top of his game and i hope it continues and i certainly wouldnt mind another film,cruel
first blood second blood third blood after about the 50th dose of blood and gore the movie actually becomes funny and therefore more enjoyable stallone who actually can act apparently chose not to in this tired continuance of the story for those who want to see body parts blown off shot off cut off or pulled off with bare hands this is definitely your movie otherwise the plot is stupidly unbelievable and unbelievably stupid the dialog idiotic when even present the acting weak the characters totally unsympathetic when gets chewed out by a goody twoshoes missionary for saving his and fellow missionaries lives by killing some scumbag pirates you actually want the missionary to get dusted unfortunately he never doesi cant believe so many people actually enjoyed this stinker and some had the nerve to compare it with blackhawk down that is nothing short of blasphemy there might have been more ammo expended in but thats where any similarity ends the group i was with actually spent the entire second half of the movie laughing at the comicbook violence spilling all over the screen i have to admit it was a guilty pleasure after sitting through the excruciatingly boring first half of the movie with its silly plot line and wooden characters also one wonders how was able to stay stocked up on just for men hair dye out in the middle of the jungleone thing ill say about this movie  it makes the other movies look a helluva lot better in every way,cruel
let me just start off by saying that the critics who are so negative about this film are blatantly dishonest when it comes to the fourth installment in this legendary saga is arguably the best of the bunch sylvester stallone tells this story in the most honest and realistic way possible the violence is brutal yes but necessary to show the horrors of war down to the last little detaili absolutely love the fact that sly shed some light on the burma crisis a lot of people in the world including many americans wanna turn a blind eye to whats going on to innocent people mainly women and children to me thats just not right sly shows us whats happening every single day outside the free world yes war is bad but in this day and age its obviously necessary to stop the worlds evil i love the message of this film when the film opens with real life footage of burma i got a little emotional especially to what follows nextthis is the most realistic film in the saga from a violence stand point also the character of john finally appears to be human at times during the film you actually think theres a chance he may get killed theres even a point where one of the mercenaries saves his life i absolutely loved this realistic approach sly took herei want to comment on slys direction this is in my opinion slys best direction work to date he mustve took a page out of sam peckinpahs book and studied it because at times it felt like i was watching a peckinpah film i love the directing styleapproach sly took here  the cinematography was absolutely beautiful brian tylers score fit the film perfectly at times the music was beautifully touching and awakened an emotional chord that was necessary other times the music was extremely thrilling and heartpounding during these intense battle sequences i love how the iconic jerry goldsmith theme was intact it gave the film that feel brian tyler succeeded wonderfully herelast but not least i honestly think this is the best action film to come a long in years i commend you sly for yet again giving us a film we can love cherish and talk about for years hopefully this film does a lot more than just entertain us hopefully it saves many peoples lives thank you sly,cruel
great continuation of the john saga hes older but still a bad mfer,cruel
i tend to agree with other reviewers here that this installment in the series is not quite up to par with the previous three it does contain an excessive amount of violence and graphic butchery and the plot line is a bit weak however there were a few elements of this film that i feel are worth mentioning and deserve some merit first upon careful examination of the mercenary team traveling with on this rescue mission its clear that these characters became the template for the team around stallone in the expendables series ie one has a british accent one is a weapons expert etc also the fact that is part of a team instead of a oneman demolition machine sets a precedent for this character and at the same time establishes the groundwork for the expendables secondly the actual character is supposed to be an aging war veteran who wants no part of violence anymore here we have stallone portraying an older version of not simply trying to revive his earlier roles lastly the final scene of this movie clearly signals the end to the saga as he comes full circle with himself this i felt was very unexpected given the nature of the character all in all this film is far from a classic but rather a final chapter in the life of a very recognizable action hero,cruel
stallone has created full on action masterpiece the bloodiest of the s i like this one the best it doesnt hold back to on the explosions violence including children thats running rampant in burma where limbs ligaments and torsos go flying in an insane slaughter now a snake hunter who tells his boss to f off as coming back with a less than adequate quota this reminds us hasnt changed one bit although hes not as fast as he used to be and his face has fattened up again his peace and tranquility is invaded when a christian aid group requests he lead them into burma big mistake to rescue the people kids and adults who are being tortured killed and kept slaves by the merciless burmaneese one troupe of hot asian girls put on strip shows for these burmeese scum while being groped and having stuff thrown at em note if you arent strong stomached avoid this one as it makes the other s look like kids flicks who first declines takes them down river where they run into a bit of trouble but its nothing our boy cant handle later gets word that they havent been heard from so he and an enlisted bunch of mercenaries set out to find them their head honcho a british guy and first getting off on the wrong foot one fantastic line later on where the british guy declines the mission and has to set him straight should go down as one of those legendary lines in the history books of cinema we see how nasty these burmaneese people are one baddie who likes to take little boys into his quarters and have sex with him his death by the last brutal scene is memorable as he cuts the baddie wide open with a machete talk about taking a gut full the trademark scene of violence in this itd be great not to have any more s as this is a great one to finish on even perfect we even see revisit his home a farm property in a long duration of end credits truly masterful filmmaking from our masterful sly in a role no other actor could fit into,cruel
this is like what would happen if you took the first 2 movies and mixed them in a blender you get the dark and realistic tone of first blood and you get the balls to the wall action of first blood part 2 ya stallone is 62 years old in this movie but who cares hes still got the chops to be a complete monster on screen and who could forget that amazing action scene at the end with him on the back of that jeep mowing down everyone with a 50 caliber machine gun one of the best action scenes in a movie and the movie ends on just the perfect note if there is something stallone knows how to do right is make up his previous films and end them right rocky 5 ended the rocky series on a dissatisfying note and rocky balboa ended it the right way same with 3 ended on a dissatisfying note and ended it the right way this is why i love stallone he cares about his workoverall if you have not seen this movie go see it is it the best movie no thats still first blood is it the best action movie yes if not his best action movie ever made final rating 910,cruel
you might criticise sly stallone for many things the steroids the slow lisped drawl the fact that his seemingly has ignored the possibility that his window of relevance closed some 20 years ago but the indisputable fact is that sly knows that critics dont pay for tickets to his movies males 16 to 30 something doto that end i have paid for rocky balboa pretty good the expendables ditto but perhaps less so and a couple years ago i lined up for 4  fully expecting it to suck by the wayand it was pretty good toosee the fact is most males 16 to 30 something know what they like and dont care too much about quality this explains the tens of millions annually that go to companies that manufacture cheap beer that make greasy food like hungry jacks and kfc that finance the inexplicable careers of scrubs like linkin park and good charlotte that keep thousands lined up to watch inferior wrestling and boxing several layers below large purse or wwe stuffwere simple beings that dont need much to consider ourselves entertained some years ago sly worked this simple formula out and has a 4 decade strong career because of itat one point in 4 someone asks sly how did you end up here his reply its complicated and howthis edition of sly kills people who speak english funny takes place in thailand and burma has given up the life to become a snake catcher he is grizzled long haired still buff maintains a low profile and is at one with the localsuntil some dogooders roll in to change things after much resistance inevitably agrees to ferry them  for no fee  upriver to burma where the peaceful locals are being terrorised and slaughtered by corrupt soldiersafter a bit of preaching and presumptions made by the church group lead by a couple named michael and sarah gets them all to the dropoff  not without first having to kill a few pirates along the journey  much to the chagrin and judgment of the group he just savedjob done right course not about 10 minutes later the group find themselves in the middle of a massacre and they are taken prisoner by the dastardly soldiersi must point out here that we are shown numerous times just how evil and disgusting these troops are lest we think is gunning down random guys for no reason they mistreat children women prisoners locals and each otherin a not so subtle way sly is saying look i more or less have to butcher these people in various bloody and gruesome ways look at what they keep doing but this time will not be alone the church has somehow financed a bunch of mercenaries into the fray they are the usual blend of quiet killers bragadocious dicks and seasoned pros keeps mum for a while  but when the time is right he clearly illustrates his alphadog status and shows everyone just who is leading this show now we are told that it is about 100 odd soldiers vs 8 guys but one of them is pushing 60 talks with a lisp and has a bow and arrowadvantage good guys and its basically bang bang stab from here for 40 minutesharking back to my point about the violence and remembering the fact that 4 follows first blood 2 and 3 this film is perhaps more violent than any of its predecessors victims are decapitated blown in half pureed and exploded into a fine bloody mist the entire gig is cgi assisted so while it is indeed more realistic i cant see just how much more disgusted anyone can be than in the former films in the seriesim not here to stick of for the violence against kids and women though but if the reports are to believed unfortunately that might be the realest part of the film so instead of picketing films like 4 that hardly glorify such actions maybe looking more closely at the alleged perpetrators might be more productive above all we must keep in mind this is a action film so we know a peaceful will be lured from a self imposed retirement to kill hundreds of highly trained soldiers all by himself in various violent waysto that end 4 succeeds the mega shootout that ends the film has an epic body count  and im sure if someone ever bothered to count it would easily top the 100 soldiers purported to be the total enemy force  and is suitably low key and reluctant until the switch is pulledas an informative tale of human drama you might be better served sticking with hotel rwanda but as an entertaining shoot em up you cant go past sly even nearly 30 years on from his first action flickfinal rating  7  10 sly once again pushes all the right buttons dont expect to be blown away though that only happens to the naughty guys in the film,cruel
20 years after iii stallone picks up the guns and blasts his way through everyone in his path this time he is blasting his way through the jungle to rescue some christians who were captured by a local infantry camp its easily believable that this film has one of the highest body counts of all time and the highest of the entire series after 20 years people thought that there was no way stallone still had it in him to come back as for one last time they were wrong yet again sylvester stallone comes back as one of the best action heroes of all timesurprisingly the quality of was really good usually sequels are never very good especially ones after 20 years of the original but there was good effort put into the script and the action scenes are mindblowing lots of people getting shot and at least 80 people are shot and killed within the course of just 5 minutes so many bullets flying around its hard to understand whos shooting who nevertheless lots of limbs getting torn apart and lots of exploding headsthe film almost entirely takes place in the jungle a nice setting for an action flick the scenes at nighttime werent very hard to follow nor were they dragged on for a large amount of time cinematography was pretty good well placed cameras that show the brains of an exploding head flying all over the lens so many people get ripped apart graphically and the cameras are so close to the action you cant miss a thingoverall it was great as an action movie but if it wasnt filmed the way it was it probably wouldnt be as good810,cruel
2008 is the fourth installment in the franchise after first blood 1982 first blood part ii 1985 and iii 1988 im a huge fan of the first one which i think is an actionadventure masterpiece but the next two films are merely okay although sylvester stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous the stories are too comicbooky and the characters are cardboard theres very little depth this third sequel makes up for all that because its not cartooney at all and theres quite a bit of depth albeit not much in dialogue formthe story john is alone  bitter and living handtomouth in thailand when a group of christian missionaries enlist him to take them into burma aka myanmar to aid a village discourages them in light of the political instability of the country which includes heavy persecutions and mass slayings but they insist on trying to help so he does it anyway weeks later he learns the missionaries have been taken captive so he goes back with a group of mercenaries to bring them out if possiblecombines elements of apocalypse now the killing fields and the first two films and is ultraserious  intense from beginning to end not to mention its one of the most violent film ever made the picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity the christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers whereas the myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for fun theyre also shown abusingraping women and boys obviously theyve given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures such reprobates are only worthy of one thing utter annihilationnumerous important themes are addressed in the picture besides the main theme  bitternessdespair and deliverance the beginning of the film shows in a complete state of bitterness hes just existing he has no friends he doesnt talk much and when he does its very few words laced with expletives the male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them two biblical proverbs state a gentle answer turns away wrath and a gentle tongue can break a bone the female missionary julie benz knows this and skillfully talks john into helping them yet theres more going on here this woman with a heart of gold is s golden connection out of the horrible rut of bitterness despite his gruff exterior she sees something in him something in his eyes  a good heart even greatness a genuine glimmer however faint is helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him john instinctively realizes the rope shes throwing him and takes hold of it theres nothing sensual about their relationship despite her attractiveness its solely spiritual she stirs in him the hope and faith hes been longing for violence is not always necessary although this is a very violent film it skillfully shows when pacifism is appropriate note the incident on s riverboat when the lead mercenary continuously insults john and tries to provoke him into a fight completely ignores him choosing not even say a word in other words he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose it takes true strength to do this and has this strength indeed john treats the guy as if hes a bothersome gnat what do you do when a gnat bothers you do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it  total pacifism does not work the new testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism jesus ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers also romans 13 clearly states the righteous laws of human governments are godordained for the purpose of punishing criminals including the right to execute when appropriate the vast majority of sane christians realize this but there are a few extremists who refuse to be balanced with the scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is never appropriate the lead male missionary in the film is such a person but perhaps hell learn the error of his ways before the story ends the simple fact is some people are so degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction notice i said ultimate the possibility of s spiritual rebirth  spoiler alert  although the first two sequels are cartooney they show searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality in the second film he gets a buddhist necklace off the asian woman he befriends and at the beginning of iii he is shown working at a buddhist temple helping the priests later he meets and wins the hearts of moderate islamic villagers and gives his buddhist necklace to a muslim boy who helped him in as previously noted the female missionary is key in johns positive transformation at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family in the usa he mumbles that he might have a father he wasnt sure and obviously didnt care she later gives him a cross necklace for helping them he wouldnt take money anyway the end of the film shows back in america walking to his family ranch obviously john had a profoundly positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story the precise nature and extent of this change is not known unless theres hopefully a fifth film  end spoiler was written and directed by stallone and filmed in thailandpersonal grade a,cruel
im here to say the final installment in the series is truly a film to see despite the series popularity only the first film had any point beyond action junkie entertainment this film is the first since the original to convey relevant themes and it does so superbly and thats a damn surprise coming from stallone who not only cowrote this but directed ithowever thats not to say this film doesnt live up to its predecessors in terms of action the action is probably the most heart pounding sht ive seen in a long time not only that but its grotesquely realistic much to my amazement disgust and appreciation and while arguably still quite the badass is not an untouchable one man army as he was before he actually keeps his shirt on now isnt that something and also quite unlike the other sequels the costar protagonists are not forgettable and i actually enjoy them as characters with the talents of tim kang matthew marsden and graham mctavish and many others it was awesome and i sht you not julie benz does incredibly well the villains are sick fcks and say very little or little that we understand you could say but this way the stakes feel more real threatening and uncheesy and the moral ideology forces you to ask yourself a lot of hard questions perhaps the best one is that the ignoring of mans violent nature is quite useless within all of us which may be a stretch to say is the natural tendency to commit violence for whether god or evil is up to yousee this movie because it is indeed great second best of the series and it offers a conclusion to the series as well and pays much deserved tribute to both john crenna and jerry goldsmith well done stallone well done,cruel
this movie takes place twenty years after the last and sylvester stallone still looks good at 62 this movie is probably the most actionpacked of the the four films there was hardly any drama but thats okay i liked the action immensestdecides to live a quiet life in thailand after his busy years but some christian missionaries want him to take them up burma where there is a civil war going on he agrees and that may have been the last thing he wanted to doi really enjoyed this movie i had doubts because i thought stallone has gotten old for these kind of movies well it turned out he has not he was also fantastic in the expendablesoverall this is a good finish to the series i think it may have been the best one i rate this film 810,cruel
john returns after years and you know what other than some facial lines and dark circles this man is as fit as eversly looks like a brick wall in this film ive never seen him so angry and ive never seen him so alone the subtle emotion of his character is powered by a sudden eruption of anger and flashbacks something which we see throughout the film he really acted well in this movieslys work doesnt end with just the acting hes back as writer and director of this film his direction abilities are shown just by just observing the other actors and his writing is as usual amazing the talkingbits are minimal in the film and the soundtrack consists of good melodious pieces and not just gunfirethe violence in this film is raw and brutal something ive never seen before the body count is colossal limbs and heads fall off bodies almost every minute of the filmlike most films has something personal this time a woman this relationship isnt one of romance but maybe one of selfunderstanding4 john the killing machine is backone of the best action films ever,cruel
this one is an absolute surprise first blood was by far one of the best action movies of its time if not ever but the next two big big yellow lemons so i went into watching this movie with very dull hopes the r18 title had me a little intrigued though but my skepticism was blown out of the water now im not saying that all of the actors are excellent one in particular stands out he hired gun with the british accent grated on me a bit but the story line is strong and the acting is adequate is old and fat but still manages to do what he does best and thats killen stuff holly crap this movie has some killen and if your an action junkie this one is for you definitely not for your little sister and your grandmother to watch one afternoon but it isnt as confronting as in movies like saving private ryan if your a fan of eighties action movies or just hardcore action with big guns and not to many recovery moments this one is for you live on john j,cruel
i was positively surprised by his film hats of to mr stallone who directed and produced it not only the action and violence scenes are extremely well shot the script is clever too at times even profound the film is not a deceptively simple story about nothing it touches on a subject of how and if people can stop violence and does religion have some or any answers the film says that horrible things happen to innocent people and nations all over the planet but nobody usually does nothing while something could be done not with words and prayers but with action in a skewed manner the film indicates also that in this case religion and good peaceful intentions result in eliminating a lot of evil though in a completely different way they intended too as their religious and medical mission triggers all the events in the movie but something has to be done instead of ignoring the problem i give it 9 and not 10 because it could have been a bit longer and more elaborate but still it is an excellent effort because it is so good the time flies and the film seems to last about an hour to those who criticize the film for too much violence u get what u wanted so u like watching action movies shootings attacks on villages etc well in real life it probably looks more or less like in this film real violence is brutal unpleasant random and unjust not your typical hollywood fare,cruel
is an excellent piece of cinematic action this is what real action looks like it has it all that a great action movie needs a little story to it great balanced acting extreme amounts of gore even some humor and tons tons of bodies i am serious when i say i was on the edge of my seat the entire movie and the only other movie that did that was the dark knight stallone is nowhere near the caliber of being called the best actor in the us or the world not close to being voted for the academy awards best actor he doesnt need to be he is known as two things in this world anymore in my eyes  rocky rocky has the heart  willpower has the courage strength  knows how to shoot and destroy anything he hates i highly recommend this to any action buff you will not be disappointed at all and also the last 15 minutes of this movie will probably be the goriest you will ever see in any movie of any genre even more than any rob zombie movie a in my eyes,cruel
well folks 4 hits hard and does not let you go in my humble opinion this movie is by far the bloodiest and highest body count in the last 25 years you get to see some excellent war footage top line equipment used in war today like the 50 caliber machine gun the story takes place in thailand as and some locals get together to go upriver into wartorn burma  the movie is based on event today in the real world the locals are the karen rebels who are fighting against the myanmar government i think i got that right anyway you get the sense that in this one  it is more of a first blood sequel than anything else this one has some great battle scenes and of course john at his very best,cruel
at first when i heard that this movie was going to be brought out i was pretty cynical about it like for a couple of other actors the 21st century hasnt really worked out well for stallone eddie murphy steven seagal jean claude van damme they all had pretty terrible movies stallone walked the same path i did think that dtox was okay but my family was a little more critical then me they are still making fun of that movie and its been 8 years agooh wellanyway this movie didnt really get me enthusiastic about it i didnt even watch it at the movies however i did get the dvd when it came out i was amazed it was great it was probably even better then parts 2 and 3 i wont deny that its a little over the top at some points heads being blown apart guts splattering everywhere and actually cutting someone basically in half by thrusting his machete in that person en yanking the blade from side to side i have some knowledge in the human anatomy and i just dont think thats possible but hey its a movie and a fun one see it positive things about movie location action stallones actingnegative things about movie some very annoying characters we are here to stop the killing yeah blow it out your ss buddy i know that you think that what you did was the right thing but taking a life is never right pss off and maybe the movie could of been a little longer 80 something minutes is a little short perhaps a little more story and extending the movie to the 2 hour limitbut dont let that stop you enjoy this movie congratulations sly along with rocky balboa this is your second 21st century bullseye,cruel
sylvester stallone like arnold jeanclaudde and the other big time action heros of the 80s and 90s may not be the greatest actor or filmmaker of all time but he can deliver but good when he wants to here is proof of this the plot centers around john as he is forced to transport and subsequently rescue a group of missionaries in the burmese war zone all the while grappling with his own inner demons the plot isnt entirely new but its not just throwaway either stallone delivers his acting with halos master chiefesquire charm which leaves the supporting characters julie benz as the goodhearted female missionary matthew marsden as the collected mercenary sniper with the barrett light 50 and graham mctavish as the perpetually angry foul mouthed mercenary leader to do most of the emotional heavy lifting and curse laced one liners but stallone still manages to give a good performance that can only be described as such hardened brutal and uncompromising this film is not for the faint of heart while the cinematography is gorgeous bruised lighting tinted with the green of the burmese jungle and sand of the village scenes the screen will be filled with what seems like a sea of blood villagers are chased into minefields and are shot and blown up soldiers are dismembered beheaded blown up disemboweled and maimed complements of and his home forged machete children are murdered gang rapes take place and the last battle scene may cause a few people to lose their most recent meal but its all in good form and the sheer gore makes the film worth watching again and again if youre looking for the next generation of film look somewhere else but if youre looking for a true blue unbridled vision of guerrilla warfare and one mans battle with both a vicious enemy and his own haunted past then get ,cruel
first to all the naysayers out there that are bashing this movie why did you go to watch it you know it is filled with violence and gore that is its purpose it is what it is it is not some shakespearean drama it wont cause you to reflect on the meaning of life it wont cause you to have deep meaningful discussions over lukewarm coffee at your film of the month club there is no message in the movie other than a 50 cal machine gun can do some serious damage pure and simple it is a movie for those that enjoy violence and if you like ichi the killer hostel gladiator etc you will like this movie if you like heads exploding and limbs being cut off by machetes you will like this movie take it for what it is worthdont try to make it something it is not this is the first action movie i have truly enjoyed in a very long time,cruel
plot john j sylvester stallone is spending his time in a remote area in thailand and then is disturbed by a bunch of missionaries trying to make a difference in burma which is a constant war zone full of death destruction rape and mutilation after sarah juliebenz one of the missionaries persuades to take the missionaries up river into burma then sure as h1t the missionaries get captured and some get killed but its then up to and a small group of mercenaries to go rescue the missionaries from a large burma army my spiel if you are not a fan of the first 3 movies then you could never fully appreciate this movies from its beginning to its end it has references to all of them from a very touching end that takes you down memory lane to the first blood but going to see this movie i sure wasnt expecting much only knowing i was going to see it regardless of anything even from the crazy trailer with let the bodies hit he floor by drowning pool playing but what i saw was something i could only say awesome this movie has it all from working on his craft of the bow  arrow to his vastly known skills behind other weapons the words quick and decise come to mind there was a scene i truly wanted to cheer when jacks those burma men with the bow  arrow and then the last one hits the water mine was amazing also there was the scene with the leader of the mercenaries talking big h1t on not knowing who the hell he is talking to if you are a fan of the past 3 movies you know where i am coming from here many people think this movie is bloody but this could have been 10 times worse then what they actually showed which is probably a good thing because to much of that is redundant and doesnt keep the audience involved for long i have to say this movie is simply beautiful from the redone score to the overall layout and feel finally all i can say now is is back in a serious way and a truly good way to possible finish this sweet saga of john 2008 review 1010,cruel
john resides near burma and lives a nice and quiet life until a group of christian aid workers need help to cross the border to help the people of burma six weeks later is approached by the priest of the church who believes that the workers have been captured by the burmese army and so must do what he does best killis an icon simple as that unlike the last rocky movie lives up to the hype without boring you i will simply say that this film is a great action film and explores the burma situationthe film does glorify violence but as an audience were meant to believe that these bad guys are the baddest of the lot and so the violence is accepted stallone is still one of the best action stars of his time and probably of all time he tears a guys throat with his bare hands and guns down men without blinking impales them with steel arrowsthis truly one of the best action movies of the last five years and by action i mean action,cruel
after 20 years sylvester stallones iconic action hero john is back and just as violent as ever hes tries not to be but that is who he is a force of nature a killing machine and as he was called in the 80s the ultimate one man army he has a little help in this movie in the form of a rag tag group of mercenaries but ultimately its who is the main instigator in wiping out the brutal burmese soldiers who are holding american missionaries hostage do not expect a great storyline or great acting but loads of quite brilliantly shot mayhem as rescues the missionaries and destroys half of burma this is a brilliant comeback in the series for stallone just like he did with rocky 6 and it did excellent box office numbers compared to 1988s iii rumors say 5 is in the pipework for 2009 or 2010 and if the multitalented stallone has his way it will be another worthy addition to the franchise,cruel
alright i still remember 1 how different it was from this movie in 1 only one man dies it was a movie about the inability of a war vet to integrate back into real life basically you felt sorry for the main character he was mistreated and he fought back the only way he knew how  shooting stuffin the later installments a change of plot was needed there was no longer any emphasis of being socially inept in real life and no story about people not liking war vets it was all stripped and was remade to a killing machine he was also put back into his natural habitat the war zone and all opponents were generic russiansvietnameseafghans the natural bad guys with no personality instead of us citizens so he had no moral problems in blowing their heads off plots gave way for action 2 had a less dominant plot of the government being corrupt somehow in not wanting to rescue vietnam captives and 3 was even weaker with a small mention of afghans having a rich heritage and living in their country wanting independence and freedom from the russian occupationand this line of thought has now reached its peak in this latest installment is his antisocial self just wanting to be left alone in some jungle catching snakes for a living the motive is the capture of the overthetop good christian missionaries wanting to bring peace and help to the locals by the equally overthetop bad local military that slaughters and tortures the locals for no reason so unloads a machine gun for about half the movie on everyone and the movie ends when everybody is dead there is no i am one man fleeing from an entire army and ill pick them off one by one with my skill here just uberunloading a gun on everybodythere is no theme whatsoever to the movie with the possible exception of the missionaries realizing you cant save the world or yourself with good intentions alonewhat this movie is is an adrenaline actionpacked bloodsoaked shootfest and if you dont care about the braindead story and thats all you want youll like it personally i didonly thing that bothered me was some of the obvious cgi,cruel
this was a good movie it had a very baction movie feel to it which i likeapparently people are filled with jellyother than the solid action and extreme almost over the top gore that im sure others have already commented on plenty this movie stood in extreme juxtaposition to other action movies and the liberal antiwar political sentiment that is commonplace in hollywood this movie is unique in that is shows the villain as pure evil the antagonist hardly ever speaks and he shows no mercy or feeling he cannot be reasoned with and he commands an army of people so corrupt with power they have become sadiststhe point in is that pure evil exists in the world and the only realistic way to stop it is through contained violence s selfannounced purpose in life even the religious pacifist found it necessary in the end to engage in violence to stop evil men and their never ending terrori enjoyed this movie for what it stood for takes place in a real life place and a real life conflict yes its real even if the media ignores it during which it becomes necessary to fight and die to protect the basic human freedoms of the innocent,cruel
this aint your daddys this a powerful expertly made action thriller with a pure and powerful message good is worth fighting for stallone is perfect he is the dirty harry of the jungle no silly dialogue no unnecessary humor  he plays it straight down the line the worst i can say is that it may be too much like apocalypse now  but it dovetails nicely with that film and this is done with power and respect  bravo slycaution although the violence is highly stylized a la peckinpah is extremely violent and not for kids who dont understand right and wrong,cruel
i remember hearing about the project for this film a few years back and i was at first uncertain as to whether or not stallone could even attempt another shot at playing since he is now 61 years old but i was wrong i will spare the details of this film that way people can figure out for themselves whether the film is any good or not as for myself it was a refreshing movie stemming from the original three that excited audiences throughout the 1980s plenty of action and violence which is what this type of film exploits quite well and similar to the other three films the music is outstanding it showed professional respect to the late jerry goldsmith finally i would like to thank sylvestor stallone for returning one of our favorite action films from the best decade of the twentieth century his strength encouragement and discipline as a movie star writer and director will go down in history as entertainment being strictly magnificent highly recommended movie,cruel
great movieout of the original 3 the first one was a solid film and the most believable the third one had the highest body count and was the most outlandish and cartoonlike but in my opinion the funnest and most enjoyable of the original 3 part 2 was probably a cross between the two not as believable as the first but not as crazy as the 3rdon to part 4 this was the best one of the series it is also by far the bloodiest goriest grizzliest and most brutal something about it perhaps the way it was shot and the lighting but it had a documentarylike feel to it and it felt more real than any of the earlier films i was worried about a sequel this long since the last one but this far exceeded my expectations,cruel
i loved it this movie is exactly what it should be no complicated plot no refined topclass acting  just a decent violent story where you have obvious bad guys and obvious good guys that take each other on in some of the most gruesome fighting scenes i have ever seenmake no mistake about it  this movie is seriously sick when it comes to the detail of the violence going on i think perhaps the most realistic movie made so far i could only detect one scene where it is clear computer rendering is going on the rest looks very very real guts flying about limbs loose heads  you better have a solid stomach for this one because this is not your usual gore this is a serious piece of work the only thing missing is the smelland while will forever be known as that movie where one guy with a machine gun somehow manages to destroy a whole army within 15 minutes this one is a fair bit more doable although still pushing it but then hey it is a movie after all and is certain to not only leave you with a feeling youve just seen an awesome action movie but also knowing you have experienced a new step in warmovie realism,cruel
sly is getting on a bit and the franchise was frankly starting to wear a bit thin half way through the first film and seriously how many times can you see nondescript third world conscripts get shot to pieceswell actually loads it turns outplot runs as follows sly looks moody and sweaty for a bit some soldiers kill some people some other people with funny accents turn up they all go on a boat ride then massacres the population of a small country why has no one thought of this beforethere is a love story but it is skilfully kept in the background and acts as a momentary pause from the relentless bloodshed a bit like driving past a monument on the way to somewhere cool houses of parliament kidsthe thing is i hate unnecessary violence in films but here it is so prolific that you are quickly desensitised and you never need to stop and thinka good hour of the film is spent demonising the burmese army you name it they do it steal kill rape pillage torture leave the toilet seat up after an hour of this you start to overload on their pointless cruelty and have built up a really strong dislike for them to the point you wish someone would just shoot them all with an incredibly oversized gunit is at this very point that sly puts his mingingest headband on and slots a belt in the 50 cala must see,cruel
would punch the hell out of bourne and i love bourne i mean the bourne movies are great but somethings always bothered me the rating system pg13 for an action movie come on back to the eighties and see the action movies like cobra movies and schwarzeneggers classic the commando those are awesome flicks now in 2008 new century etc stallone is now 61 years old and honestly i didnt believe in him when i first heard about that fourth movie i was worried i can tell you but one day  when they put the first footage of the trailer on the internet  something of a miracle happened i was amazed when i saw the footage and i mean it i almost fell off the chair my jaw was on the groundnow lets talk about the movie as many people said before me this movie is not for the squeamish and definitely not for the faint of heart brutal with capital b the violence is on the top and is meaner and angrier than ever when hes killing hes killing as the tag line said when youre pushed killing is as easy as breathing thats not just another the tag line is great and thats gonna sell the movietype of line sly raise the bar with the action scenes in the movie in the third act everyone goes nuts all hell breaks loose and thats good i am happy sly is back after all those crappy movies like the driven hes backwith a vengeance,cruel
well thats for you to decide but one thing is made clear here seems to have a problem staying retired but then again im not complaining quite the contrary i really liked this movie that does not take any prisoners or at least doesnt take any that of course means that the movie is pretty gory and explicit in its portrayal of violence although some might have become numb to the whole blood on screen violence it does its best to show how gruesome death can bewhile i thought this wouldnt be as political as the first installment of the series it does shed some light on an actual conflict that goes on for years now i dont know if you can call it a good thing but some rebels are using quotes from the movie for their fight for the good cause,cruel
lets start off by saying wow i was shocked by this movie i went in with extremely low expectations with this one because of the previews for it the story line is simple but very effective it is on the same grounds of saving private ryan mercenaries are called to rescue some captured missionary workers is hired to be their guide since well he delivered those missionaries this wouldnt be a movie with out sly having some scenes of action in it and this movie does not disappoint it is by far one of the most brutal movies i have ever seen it surpasses saving private ryan black hawk down we were solider and any other graphic war film you have seen because well that is what this is a war film i did not give this film 10 stars because well there are some parts that just do not fit and that is the female lead her acting was bland and not very believable and of course some of slys scenes but we are not watching this movie to see sly be emotional honestly and he does show some but we are watching this to see kick some major ass overall it was a great action movie not the best action movie of 08 but it is up there the trailer does not do this justice at all,cruel
this is a tremendous film stallone has proved once again that he can exceed even himself he has given us a fine career his last two movies rocky and are the proof positive of his multifaceted talent this film also brings us to the realization of some fundamental realities first it is completely realistic not just with the violence and gore but with the actual circumstances among the people of burma today as seen in the recent flooding the people of burma live and die under one of the most oppressive inhumane and unjustifiable military juntas the world has ever seen and have for decades why the world allows this to continue is a testimony to the deterioration of conscience in the general populace and the unwillingness to sacrifice for the good of humanity there will never be another greatest generation the second reality is the visualization of a few dedicated individuals who under the worst of circumstances risk and give their lives for the betterment of others a moving film mr stallone you make us proud,cruel
stallone brought back in a big and gory way is living in thailand doing cool things like catching fish with a bow and arrows capturing cobras and working out to keep an awesome looking physique you know manly things that i wish i could do so that i could have muscleswell except for the cobra catching minds his own business until these missionaries come to him asking to borrow his crappy boat so that they can help the natives in burma after some hesitation of sending them into a war zone and the entreaties of one lady missionary consents to this mission of mercyon the way down the river things get hairy does his thing and gets the missionaries to their location then a few days later finds out that the missionaries got captured by some really bad military forces in burma who also kill rape and terrorize innocent civilians for some demented reason so our man is commissioned to take a group of mercenaries to try to get the missionaries out of harms way a whole lot of killing ensures this movie kind of is a shock to the system even if you have been watching gory action films for years just because of how civilians are messed over there is so much blood and gory scenes you kind of wonder how in the world did manage to get an r rating stallone explained in an interview that he was trying to draw attention to the plight of civilians in war torn regions especially burma and that is why he intensified the violencei read on imdb that freedom fighters in burma fighting the corrupt regime quote lines from and bootleg copies circulate widely despite the penalty of 10 years in jail for possessing a film or so i heard was kind of too short at 80 minutes and ended in a weird but necessary way i thought it was a good film talked about some social issues and is back i hope 5 comes soon,cruel
if you are in the mood to enjoy a movie where you watch a lot of  get blown up including people who also get maimed in varied and exciting fashions this is the film for youif only this could have played on the deuce back in the day in nycit would have been a perfect grindhouse picture as it is it kicked some massive ass and was a lot of fun to watchwas it smart hell no but it was well worth the ticket price to watch sly stallone jack mothers up in some sweet ways for 90 minutesi was reminded of some of the italo cannibal horror films of the seventies while watchingcannibal ferox and cannibal holocaust in particularand wonder if sly took any cues from son sage who has been responsible for bringing many of these pictures back into vogue on how to bring the ultraviolencea lot of fun and a great action film 10 out of 10,cruel
i give 7 and a half stars out of 10 i really like the movies first blood 2 and 3 they are the action movies that started all those typical 80s action movies in the late 80s i think 2 is pretty much the best one it is nice to see stallone doing again the action is pretty cool in the movie but it is not really packed with action it is very bloody and gory it has pretty graphic violence limbs fly off as people are struck by bullets bloody gunshot wounds blood spurting and spraying chuncks of flesh fly everywhere heads explode grisly images a guys throat is ripped out tissue arteries human bodies explode into pieces a guy is blown in half i especially like the part where shoots the guy in the driver seat with the 50 cal old school the guy just blew up and blood and flesh flew everywhere all that stuff some of the blood and gore is kind of cgi but there is not as much gore and as you may think its not exacally all over the place if you ask me there is a lot though but it is not constant and i also like the part where shoots that truck load of burmese soldiers and blood and chuncks fly everywhere he just mowed them all down that was old school the thing that bugged me is that was not running around with an machine gun and shooting people and throwing grenades around like the good old days the only time he was shooting a machine gun was at the ending battle he did not shoot too many people but he shot an even amount it kind of seemed like the mercenaries were hogging all the action but i guess did enough action i like the part where cuts out the main bad guys entestines and they spill all over the ground that guy deserved it a very ruthless and sadistic person and also shot a few arrows at people and that was about all he did he did not say too much in the movie and there are explosions in the movie too but not a lot did not say too many bad words he said a few but those mercenary guys where swearing like crazy saying the f word a lot and those were pretty cool guys good characters especially that bald guy he was always angry the burmese soldiers were some pretty bad people raiding villages and killing everyone and talking their children to be soldiers they were evil but that stuff actually goes on over there from time to time it seemed stallone was trying to recreate 3 they seem kind of identical he goes in rescues the missionaries the rebels come at the end all the bad guys die and that is that is a back to the basics kind of movie it is old school it is very violent and it is like one of those good old guy movies the movie is very entertaining but i guess i expected a little more i wonder how the movie will be one dvd maybe better who knows deleted scenes and stuff i hope stallone does another movie or another action movie at least,cruel
after establishing his taciturn vietnamveteran sufferinghero persona as a movie icon in 1982 years are with reference to time of movie although they may well be also the time of the stories in the movie john went back to vietnam 1985 then afghanistan 1988 to do what he did best then after 20 years during which he we are implicitly told was in a selfimposed exile in indochina he is back in action the last two minutes of this movie may be significant during which we see him finally back home in arizona in front of his family range is that sylvester stallone at 62 signning off looking at him in 4 i wont want to bet on itthe movie starts however with leading a life of retreat in a pastoral paradise in thailand making a living out of catching snakes for tourist shows fishing with arrows of course and hiring out his river boat the story is simple  he takes a group of missionaries into warzone burma goes back later with a group of mercenaries to rescue them from the sadistic burmese army end of storywhat makes this 4 stand out among not only movies but battlefield thrillers in general is its crisp nononsense focused approach doing away with the easy pitfalls of too much buildup or tedious messages it does have those things but at just the right amount the statement is made directly up front in a cryptic exchange between and sarah missionary woman telling him that they are taking medicine and supply to the villages ravaged by the soldiers are you taking any weapon sarah no then you wont change anything nothing more needs to be said as to buildups of s action there are two one with 5 pistol shots that takes down 5 river pirates in much less than 5 seconds the other is halfadozen arrows doing pretty much the same thing to the sadistic soldiers just about right for teasing the audiences appetite a little but leaving them with ample to fully enjoy the finale of a pandemoniumjust about everyone agrees that this movie is about the most entertaining you can find in bloodprofusion violence but this does not give a full picture this movie is also the most faithful to if i may coin the splitsecond violence school yes there are all kinds of gory scene imaginable but you dont even need to cover your eyes because if you wink youll miss most of them so if you are lucky youll enjoy the excitement of glorious explosions and exhilarating blasting of arsenal but get spared much of the nausea from dwelling on what these things do to the human body prepare for a lot of blood though but as kitisha the mikado gilbert and sullivan says you wont hate me because im just a little teeny weeny wee bit bloodthirsty will you,cruel
the best action movie ive seen in years sylvester stallone makes a triumphant return to the series that transformed him into an action icon if this is the swan song for john stallone made sure the ultimate badass went out with one hell of a bangstory lines in action movies are generally where the genre comes up short although first blood set a standard there that lost its way in 2 and 3 features a simple and straight forward plot line but it possessed enough of a soul to make you feel invested in its outcome in fact i actually felt myself slightly moved by some of the events that took place and for a straight up action flick this is almost unheard of stallone managed to breath life into the characters and i found myself pulling for each one of them by the movies endthe one weakness of and the primary factor that kept me from considering this an extraordinary film was in the screenplay the writing wasnt overtly bad but there were some moments that felt a bit too clich other than that i loved the story stallone went to great lengths to make you hate the bad guys he pulled no punches in the portrayal of them committing heinous acts and when turnabout has them getting literally torn apart by the good guys it makes you almost want to stand up and cheerthe special effects in are amazing but not for the squeamish this is not the kind of movie to take your girlfriend to heads are flattened and limbs are torn off by and his sniper pal youve been warned however if youre the type of person who thinks that bloody explosions are something wonderful to behold you will be in awe of the action sequences in this movie the message behind the film tracked with me as well and i found that to be yet another unexpected plus really is loaded with entertainment and not just on the lowest visceral level if youre looking for shakespearean drama then youre turning over the wrong stone if you want an orgasmic noholdsbarred action fest with a decent story to go along with it is a definite cantmiss film,cruel
this is the first movie i watch i intend to watch the first three as welli made the decision to before watching this almost all i know about as of writing this is what i saw in this film the trailers promised a massive actionfilmand the red band ones a bloodsoaked one at that and the movie most definitely delivers its entertaining throughout the plot is fine certainly not the best but it isnt the focus of this anyway the pacing is spoton i was neither bored nor overwhelmedwhich is not at all to say that the action is anything less than epic for a second from start to finish the acting is reasonable no downright embarrassing performances dialog varies but the good is more great than the bad is awful characters arent half bad cinematography and editing are pretty good if the latter doesnt permit the viewer much of an overview of some of the battles although that could be the intention when in such a situation for real one cannot be expected to fully grasp everything the action is awesome explosions gunfights its there its wicked cool it should be noted by anyone who even vaguely considers this that this has a lot of gore and blood and it doesnt attempt to hide it from sight effects are solid all the way the guns wellchosen and accurately depicted this is only the second of slys directing efforts ive watchedfirst being the second rocky film and he certainly does commendable work here one thing that could be argued and that others have brought up is the way the violence is shown in the same manner whether it is against those we sympathize with or those we want to watch stallone put the hurt on which can be criticizedas well as the inclusion of actual footage from the conflict he can be called either brave or foolhardy for his decision to make this both his sit in the directing chair and his position in front of the camera starring and i suppose there are points where his age shows but i feel he pulled it off well remarkably so in both i recommend this to any fan of action sylvester stallone and i presume but do get a second opinion someone whos actually watched the others before you take my word on that last one 810,cruel
as the rather contrived title of my review suggests this film is rather like the mission which it portrays it exists to serve one purpose deliver a level of literally visceral action we have not seen in 20 yearsthere has rarely been a vessel better suited to this type of endeavour than stallone as has become the movies definitive man of action over words the history of the character and of the actor playing him imbue the entire film with the sense that once that low activation energy has been reached a chain reaction is set in motion which cannot be stopped put a bee in s bonnet and he doesnt so much shake it out as eat the freaking hat bug and alldo not go in expecting a parable for modern american foreign policy or any astute political observations on the burmese situation do not expect awardworthy performances or dialogue this film is here to punt your balls into your throat and it does so with no mercy and no remorsethe only reason it doesnt get 9 stars is because its too damn short,cruel
i take back every sarcastic remark i ever made while this was in productionthis was so damn good for one thing sly at 61 being built like a tank and pulling off the physically demanding scenes  filmcamera work not withstanding it was still amazing to see  freakin impressivesly not that youll read this but you have my respect and admiration once again  i was let down with rocky balboa but this wasover the topone other thing for all those who hated this movie im not a fan of gore or even action movies anymore to be honest gore bothers me and most action movies are brainless nonsense thrown together to make a buck and promote some tough pretty boy as the newest it guy in hollywood this film drew upon real word circumstances and although ultra violent and fictional it was done so to illustrate the extreme problems still ongoing in third world nations  burma is one of thembasically the hell that descended upon the burmese army was not gratuitous it was more the wrath of god,cruel
i went to see last night after reading all the reviews on this site about it i was thinking it might just be a mindless kill fest and nothing much else there was a lot of killing dont get me wrong this film does have some of the most realistic battle violence that will ever be seen this film also portrays the brutal reality of the civil war in burma it gives a frank no bullshit look at how people are persecuted exterminated and the horrors of genocide stallone as an aging war weary does a great job he just becomes the character so well that it seemed to me that he had never stopped being john some spoilers ahead the dialogue is very one line and there are a few one liners from that made the audience laughthe action starts pretty much straight away and the excitement and anticipation of more is awesomeoverall the film is a solid action movie with as much butchery blood and guts as a slaughter house stallone gives a great performance as he looks great for his age gotta love the growth hormones the story isnt all that great but that can be overlookedi believe that this film is a fitting end to the career of the greatest action hero of our time salute to you john ,cruel
hey movie master tj here and i just watched the 4th from a fan of the series point of view it was bloody violent and full of pondering moments this film actually is somewhat of a realistic film it takes place in burma which is an off the map war zone that no one really knew about until stallone called the un wanting a location for to be inthe problems of burma actually do exist and writer director producer and main star sly stallone brings it to the big screen in this entry to the 25 year old series is isolated in thailand giving boat rides for money to people he does this for a christian group when they become captured in burma and he must go inthis movie offered more development for going off of ii and iii without the cheesy 80s music the film also gives less screen time than the previous films and focuses on a real story it also had a great color and sound overall placing you right in the middle of the action what i did not like was the unsteadiness of the camera in the dialogue heavy scenes and the camera acting as a firehouse in the action scenes maybe sly took too much responsibility for one film but overall the film isnt that badfans of the series should check it out and serious film enthusiasts should give it a once over the reaction so far from fans and critics is mixed but overall received better than 2 or 3 out 4 stars i give it 4 for historical accuracy action complex plot and for a great ending for a series although there have been rumors and talks of a v im tj goodlet and this has been the film corner when the dvd comes out ill be sure to give you a review of that as well,cruel
writer  director sylvester stallone raises the bar for violent bloodthirsty combat sequences in his third sequel to first blood 1982 the original epic about exgreen beret warrior john s exploits moreover makes the rugged battle scenes in ridley scotts adrenalinefueled black hawk down and steven spielbergs bulletriddled saving private ryan look like pugnacious paintballblasting tournaments no doesnt boast the production values or elaborate villains that he confronted in first blood part 2 of iii indeed there are fewer explosions but the considerably ramped up violence and the vicious burmese army troops compensate for those shortcomingsthe scenes of carnage in are so intense and gory that youll shudder with revulsion every time a bullet pulverizes somebody including the hideously repugnant villains if the first two movies first blood and first blood part 2 served as referendums on the contentious vietnam war with 3 skewering the soviet invasion of afghanistan then it should come as no surprise that four exposes the genocide raging for sixty years in burmain fact stallone selected burma officially called the union of myanmar as the setting because the conflict between the burmese army and the karen ethnic minority qualifies as the worlds longest civil war said stallone in a recent movies online interview from the time i heard about it and began researching it i though if i could just combine the tworaising awareness of the karenburmese civil war and giving the audience a good adventure storythat would be perfect art monterastelli and stallone coscripted and it clocks in at about 80 minutes with a 12 minute end credit roll essentially its like an extended ateam episode with gallons of blood and gore and terrific computer generated special effects that heighten the realism of the battle sequencesmind you twenty years has elapsed since hardbodied tightlipped swapped lead with anybody nothing has changed although its as predictable straightforward but solemn as previous actioneers is also as oldfashioned as any of the 19421945 world war ii hollywood propaganda movies that justified us intervention in a global war stallone appears a mite long in the tooth hes 62years old but he looks like samson in fatigues with blood veins entwining his bulging forearms like giant pythons unlike his last movie rocky balboa where he proudly displayed his physique  stallone doesnt shred his fatigues interestingly he may be one of the few action heroes who refuse to rip his shirt to ribbons like the classic pulp fiction hero doc savage man of bronze every time that he tangled with an adversarywhen we meet he is living in northern thailand runs a longboat the river salween captures cobras for a side show and does a little blacksmithing several human rights missionaries ask him to ferry them into nearby burma so they can deliver medical supplies and services to destitute karen villagers initially the worldweary refuses but one of the missionaries sarah plainjane looking julie benz of showtimes dexter convinces him to take them the ride upriver evokes memories of apocalypse now with marlon brando no sooner have the christian missionaries reached a remote village and improved the quality of life than the evil soldiers arrive they either kill or enslave everybody these scenes are rather graphic afterward reverend arthur march ken howard of michael clayton who represents the missionaries approaches about taking a motley crew of mercenaries in to rescue sarah and the survivors the mercenaries have second thoughts when they learn that the army outnumbers them tentoone shames them into doing their job naturally cannot pass up a good fight so he breaks out his bow  arrow later he wields a 50 caliber machine gun with devastating results mowing down well over seventyfive soldiers s best line is live for nothing or die for something richard crenna briefly appears in a montage sequence as colonel trautman when ponders his fate talented exit wounds lenser glen macpherson photographed the action against authentic thai backgroundshappily brings our hero full circle in what stallone has said is the final film,cruel
with how old stallone is youd think hed be slowing down by now but this movie is awesome it starts out a little slow with just living a simple life as all the movies do but then someone asks for help he helps things get complicated and he starts killing but with this one its more of a building action than the other ones he slowly works up to killing more people and for about the first 120 minutes of the movie only kills a few dozen so it doesnt become stale and repetitive then near the end of the movie is a scene in a burmese army base camp which is the site of debauchery that would give blood diamond a run for its money and throughout the story you see more and more gruesome and barbaric practices by the burmese army that they basically get away with then it builds to a climax thats so exciting and long in coming that i found myself smiling broadly and giggling like a schoolgirlsylvester is as inarticulate as ever but he knows this and is a man of few words in this movie the storyline flowed and more or less made sense without any real glaring errors or oversights also the special effects are amazing heads implode people step on mines and explode limbs are realistically blown off and gaping seethrough holes are shot through people and unlike the 80s where you could often tell what was a fake prosthetic in this movie the special effects combine seamlessly with the movieits certainly not a movie to take your mother to unless she likes this sort of stuff but this is a mustsee for all action movie lovers sensible script awesome special effects few words from sylvester stallone decent acting and a kick climax make this a movie well worth your money to see it in theaters or on dvd,cruel
i went in the movie theater not expecting a good movie in fact i have never seen the first 3 s before and thought this would be another mindless gore fest where goes on a killing spree i havent seen any of sylvester stallones movies and thought oh my godwhat am i doing by the first 30 minutes i was right the actors had no expression or feeling in their dialogue and i wanted to leave to go watch cloverfield but then it got better an emotionless rock at some times finally gives in it takes a big spark to set off the flame in but when he is at his vietnam wars fullest he can kill with ease there is no character development producer expects us to already watch the first 3 s and the plot is simple we have a group of missionaries from america who want to ease the situation in burma where thousands of normal everyday civilians are being killed they enlist s help who takes an emotional attachment to a blonde woman they are captured and the action really sets off from there the only drawback to the film is that the battle only took place in two scenes i would have liked to seen going into a bigger camp and blowing it up overall i give this film a 910 for the action effects,cruel
just another of sylvester stallones recent films that seems to scream out stallone has a fixation of fighting to be immortalized as a nonaging dinosaur character at 62 he dyes his hair in ravenred swings punches and kicks as if hes still 25 and of course just as egoistic in trying to preserve his s ancient avenging and violent streak and tactics oh yes for all that youthful image that stallone sets out to project theres one thing he has failed to do prevent the portrayal of his creative process and imagination as having aged over the 20 years even julie benzs sweet damselindistress doesnt to help erase the image of macho s aging yearsyep theres nothing refreshingly new to this s revengeful fantasy nor in s exhibition of his fighting skills and tactics he keeps exploding in his killing spree whipping out his weapon to blast opponents into multibody parts  just like weve seen doing flick after flick and ferociously evil foreign government militia attacking scared villagers through fields littered with land mine with the unlucky ones being blown to fragments nothing refreshingly new but can be considered as pretty stunted in creative imagination hey we are seeing this same old scenario being repeated in so many war flicks unless stallone actually believes that the audience do have shortmemories and believe they are seen creatively new spins by the way are those asian militia thugs the leftovers from the vietnam wars in stallones imagination ah yes nicely flavoured with asian jungle atmosphere of course it would be rather tricky for a with aging braincells to flex his brawn and weapons in cities cramming with spycams and camdetectors that would take better brains like james bond or jason bourne than guns and muscles alone to defeat any ugly and vicious militia governmentthis film would have been fine if seen in the 1960s during contemporary days it comes through as a very predictable film with nothing thats refreshingly imaginative or creative its like paying precious dollars to see repeated action scenes from other flicks and thats pretty insulting to the hardcore film audience,cruel
action packed movie with a great story i love these types of violent revenge type movies bravo stallone bravo,cruel
is an incredible fourth installment and the best sequel yet sylvester stallone gives an incredible performance once again and his direction is also great the action is incredible and well filmed the music by brian tyler is fantastic and its well paced the ending is especially good however a small amount of the effects look cheap,cruel
i watched tis today to prepare for the new one and honestly its balls out the best of the series and one of the greatest action films ever made to think it has taken 11 years to get the next installment is madness i doubt i am writing this review for anyone who hasnt seen this already but if you havent i will explain it simply its ultra violent limb chopping madness it has a message but the fanboy nostalgia will overtake any sense of charity between his newest rocky balboa and this stallone has absolutely nailed what fans were expecting in the 21st century bravo my man,cruel
the movie is insanely bloody thus making it highly realistic i love seeing legs and body parts get blown to air great movie,cruel
4 is the fourth instalment of series and as expected has loads of action sylvester stallone is as usual at his best there is not much support from the support cast but that will not disappoint you acting of sylvester stallone is great screenplay is good location is good you can be disappointed by the storyline as the story was expected and has nothing new to offer background music supports the scenes overall a good action movie,cruel

admittedly ive never seen any of the previous instalments so i was unsure what i was letting myself in for safe to say that the certification it obtained was very much needed because this was extremely violent outrageously bloody packed full of bullets relentlessly severing limbs and stallone being a total badass as usual just a shame about the supporting characters and clichd plot john has been quietly living in thailand to which he is soon tasked with saving the lives of various captives from a group of savage burmese military officials very few words are spoken by as he lets his piercing arrows do the talking cracking craniums detaching arms and slicing bodies in half his weaponry is the stuff of gods stallone puts the majority of the cameras focus into the blazing action and visceral savagery of these freedom fighters often far too distressing to watch seriously inhumane actions that manage to convey some totally unexpected emotional impact thats before continues his rampage across the thick jungles of burma making you fist pump the air as he decimates an entire squad like some sort of avenging deity the damsel in distress plot is somewhat outdated and acts as flimsy motivation for detracting from the true monstrous story at play the innocent group of individuals wanting to help civilians and the mercenaries sent to save them were functional as characters just slightly dull and unmemorable a few stupid scenes particularly the atomic bomb explosion diminished the realism of its environment and possibly made me face palm also the cgi gore was noticeable at times yet fortunately infrequent the concluding thirty minutes of bodies flying in every direction and exploding like bloodfilled water balloons can be mindnumbing but ill be damned if this wasnt some oldschool fun,cruel
its short at 1hr31mins 7 out of 10 relentless action of blood and guts 254 people die by s gun and knife tarratino would love thatjohn has been leading a quiet life in thailand until he is asked to ferry a group of missionaries into war torn burma when they are captured teams up with a rag tag regiment of mercenaries and heads back into the jungle on a rescue mission that will force him to return to the battlefield with explosively violent consequences  hitting new heights of carnage and raw excitement the one man killing machine is back with a vengeance it was worth waiting to see it in the cinema after seeing stallone in the 80s playing ,cruel
believe me when i say you will feel what a single bullet can do to human body and how devastatingly chaotic war is all while watching this moviefrom a evil military general portrayal of burma and his merciless soldiers to a group of determined christian aid workers willing to walk right into death well until theyre in awe and its too late to the equally shrouded rage pumping through the socalled boatman every single moment in this movie will give you qualmsthis pure adrenaline action watch would unleash raw blood fight the likes of which are rare to find in even the most brutal action filmsyoud be surprised when you realize stallone himself directed this momentum masterpiece,cruel
well holly hell is back with a vengeance here probably one of the most violent films ive seen but i will say once the audience got over the initial shock at the type of visceral brutal and gratuitous violence we were witnessing we started cheering with each blood spraying kill it was entertaining in a grisly sort of wayive been a lifelong fan of the franchise and this fourth instalment is excellent granted a very different type of film then the originals its a bit light in the plot department but set in a backdrop of real life atrocities in burma we join 20 years after his little afghanistan extraction john is living the quiet life in a rural village in northern thailand he has given up fighting found a shirt and now spends his days capturing snakes for local entertainers and chauffeuring locals in his old pt boathes also gotten pretty bitter with age world weary and tired so that when a group of christian missionaries ask for his help in reaching their aid camp in war torn burma he refuses his response at one point being fu the world after pretty blonde sarah miller tries again to get his help this time giving him a necklace seems thats all the girls have to do to get his attention he finally agrees to ferry them upriversome time later the mission is attacked the dogooders taken hostage and is now asked to transport a group of mercenaries on a rescue mission and thats when hell rains down the violence from this point on is brutal and gratuitous with video game style killings bodies blown apart blood spraying the camera tons of explosions after that savage attack on the village you dont have much remorse thoughthe closing scene is just perfectthe long road home 1516,cruel
the forth installment of the franchise goes beyond all expectations its one of the greatest action movies of the past couple decades and never ceases to engage the viewer in non stop enjoyment stallone rejuvenates the franchise perfectly and this movie is not only a must see but a must buy the movie takes an almost two decade old franchise and brings it to modern terms with an exploding fashion the plot is interesting and new while the characters are well acted and realistic along for the ride are soon to be classic one linens and the unforgettable kill scenes every second john is on the screen killing someone the viewer is on edge from just how hardcore is in the end stallone brought and remolded him to a new generation in the best way possible,cruel
my favorite scene in isnt until the very end of the movie but its when the titular character is seen walking back to the ol homestead in bowie arizona its clear right from the get that stallone is taking this character and the series back to its roots no more evident than the heavy use of goldsmiths horns from first blood ill admit bias because im a big fan of that score and stallones use thereof puts me in the right mood not one minute after the movie begins its just right for thematically bringing john fullcirclewhen i first saw this movie almost seven years ago i was as put off by the violence as anybody its offputting to say the least but the carnage is so visceral and the bad guys so vile that youre just dying to see quench the bloodthirst in the worst way and the payoff is worth it710,cruel
living a lonely and quiet existence in thailand after twenty years john is asked by a small group of missionaries to take them by boat to wartorn burma tries to tell them that they cant change anything there but reluctantly gives into their persuasions once the bleeding hearts arrive in savage burma they are captured and its up to and a team of mercenaries to venture in and save themafter the original first blood 1982 this is the next best entry in the fourfilm series what first stands out after so long is that the 60yearold sylvester stallone who also directed was successful in making this work his john appears strong if aged and he is still the same action hero who first appeared on screen 26 years earlier the plot here is simple but thats not an issue because the film delivers it is relentlessly bloody and gory with body parts and devastation by the truckloads we really can sense the primitive atrocities taking place in burma not only against strangers but even against their own people i do not ordinarily recommend movies relying so much on sheer blood and guts and much of the carnage here is rendered via obvious fakelooking cgi effects i should add but this action packed installment succeeds at what it sets out to do fortunately the overabundance of gore is balanced by stallones heartfelt personage of john the ending of the film was the perfect way to finalize this series  out of ,cruel
we need our superheroes to help eliminate the scum that populates our planet here we are in burma the sight of a recent genocide and assorted unmentionable atrocities but that doesnt stop stallone from not only mentioning these unthinkables but rubs our faces in it so as we cant help but noticedelivering this message in a hard rrated movie that has cgi and other violence shown in video game styling is one way to get this political statement into the skulls of otherwise oblivious teenagers and slowtocomealong apatheticsit would probably be quite amazing at just how many of these moviegoers sped to their keyboards and googled burma after seeing kick ass for that the film cannot be faulted it is one of the tenants of art to open up perceptions and shine a light in the darkness so yes there is blood galore and body parts a flying and it is all rather dumbeddown but as long as people are talking and some of them get involved if only on an intellectual internet level so be it this is entertainment horror movie entertainment thing is this horror is taken from the pages of real life and is not a fantasy or a personal story it is a story affecting millions and there is hardly a whisper on the evening news so it is up to our fictional superhero to lead the charge,cruel
i have been a fan for many years in fact i have fond memories of building forts out of couch cushions as a kid while watching only to destroy them through wrestler type body slams these movies always got me hyped up and for good reason they were balls to the wall hardcores military movies that were more about showing the incredible force that a single determined soldier could bring which was a an incredible action experience however make no mistake 4 is a different movie from the rest this movie does not follow then same theme from the rest it is in a universe all its own yet it is just as good it has a heart to it not seen in previous films a main plot point is a christian group going into a trecharous world that only a bold soul would venture to being a christian myself i find the portrayal of the christian missionaries very tasteful will please the action fans looking for intense action it is as hardcore as an r rating will allow fans will not be disappointed with the action but will need to understand the new direction the series has taken it isnt like the others the theme as changes but the action is still taken up a notch,cruel
sylvester stallone is leading a quiet life some where in thailand one day a group of missionaries come to him and ask if he could ferry them to burma in order to relive the pain of inhuman war with bibles and medicine really doesnt want to take them there but he does that none the less later is hired to get the missionaries back as they got capturedthe plot of isnt any high literature its just as simple and plain it sounds a rescue mission with on the lead through out the film does what he does best kills people and this time he does it bloodier than ever blood guts and limbs fly all over the place and theres no hint of splatter comedy in that it actually finally looks like someone is portraying the gun damage right this time when a mortar round hits a man he just doesnt flip around in the air but disappears in a bloody cloudstallone has managed to direct very good sequel for its interesting and exiting and the action is top notch this certainly isnt an action film for everyone but if you like a bit of old school but with better effects you just might enjoy this i know i did and it certainly is a better film than parts 2 and 3,cruel
i was full of excitement when i first saw the 3 min preview of this movie that was released on the internet early on so i was full of hope that the movie lived up to expectations and it didnt disappoint stallone has brought to the table exactly what everybody wants from this genre of movie plenty of raw bloody action i thought the film was brilliant perhaps a little short a simple story that doesnt hang about and gets straight into the action quite quickly well filmed the cinematography is excellent in this movie along with the sound especially the 50cal used at the end of the movie and the violence is on a different level to what we call action movies these days and i was glad it wasnt 12 rating or pg13 in the states like die hard 4 ohowever there were two things i may have changed in the movie i wasnt a big fan of the mercaneries i feel they werent necessary if they were perhaps better actors should of been placed in the roles also i know stallone is getting on a bit i felt wasnt really involved in any long action sequences it went straight from the bomb he sets to the end with him on the 50cal very quickly perhaps a few fight sequences could have been used in between overall i thought the film was excellent with stallone sorting another franchise which needed to be ended correctly but i am hearing a part v is in the pipeline and if it carries on in the same way as 4 he cant go wrong,cruel
holy crap its kind of silly that they even brought this character back after so much time i mean he was a relic of the vietnam war and while thats not forgotten not even in the political spectrum the political arguments those original films moronically made are pretty dead the new doesnt even mention vietnam it takes place in nearby burma a country of great social strife and unending violence believe me doesnt help matters much as far as the violence is concerned when a group of christian missionaries which he helped get into burma is captured joins a band of mercenaries to try to extract them its the most brutal mainstream american film ever made no doubt brains splatter heads roll and limbs fly off the worst thing is this kind of carnage is happening in a lot of places on earth every day although probably not instigated by a 62 yearold vietnam vet surprisingly the film doesnt take this lightly at all it wants the audience to feel bad its hard to recommend this to anyone because it really is disgusting it is however undoubtedly gripping as well if you can stomach it,cruel
is an excellent action movie for those who just like to sit down and relax for some good entertainment you can follow the storyline almost with your brain turned off and you will enjoy the show there are a few minor flaws such as cheap looking blood splatter and explosion cgi effects also the movie is extremely violent  among the goriest i have ever seen if this is good or bad i cannot tell you just have to be prepared for it when you see a movie like thisis also very well cut  it is short intensive and never boring  not even for a second i rate this movie 810 because i would never rate a nobrainer action movie higher than that no matter how good it is ,cruel
this is by far the best fast paced action movie ive ever seen absolutely brilliant stallone has made some really good stuff in the past but this takes the cake why do i like this movie so much well lets see  it was not long and drawn out stallone kept it short and to the point the action scenes are out of this world the acting is way above acceptable this is just a masterpiece in every sense ok its an action movie but delivers muchmuch more than expected i loved the rockys and to this day i can still watch them and lets not forget all the work stallone did behind the scenes of some great hollywood movies back in the day it dont know what its going to take to top this movie i think stallone has just given a whole new meaning to action movies anybody out there who has an action movie in the making stop watch this movie and get a few tips before finalizing stallone you are a marvel and congratulations on this masterpiece,cruel
what i missed in this very brutal and hard movie were battle scenes with helicopters or other air planes therefore i have seen a show with lot of bullets that found at least their targets very exactly congratulations to sylvester stallone for his constant cool performance in this role then great respect for his direction and the superb images i find the running time is just right but i have to admit that i wanted it continues i hope there well be another sequel i was very impressed by the bloody special effects that i have never seen before normally i dont like to see violent films but here i make an exception because the or terminator series are my favorites in my generation final vote 710 a must see for all stallone fans,cruel
after rocky balboa stallone is back again with his another cult character in the 80s these movies made him what he is today on of the most known action star the new is brutal and bloody full with fantastic action scenes stallone is in good condition enough to play his famous role again fantastic with age 60 the story is simply but enough civil war in burma innocent people dies and goes angry but its too short the entire film is only 80 minutes the oldies are 90 or 100 and its a little bit fast there is not enough emotion or feelings kills and kills and kills i think it would be better maybe when the story follows the older ones will kidnapped and he must escape and survive thats my only big problem with 4 ok the visual is perfect explosions bodies falling in pieces everywhere is flushed with blood and brain but the character is a bit simply and empty yeah i know is alone since ages and he wants nothing but his piecehe cant find it again hes a terminator he must kill hes back and still perfect congratulation sly,cruel
sly stallone once again comes back with an incredible picture that stands true to its origins as with rocky balboa stallone has stuck to the original principles of the three previous films and the fourth instalment is an excellent follow on this film is very graphic a lot more violent than previous films but it all fits in with the theme of the movies and the nature of the character the film was directed by stallone himself and as a result was able to make the film very personal to the main character as if it were john sat on the directors chair overall an excellent action flick that continues to build pace throughout leaving you blown back into your seat and making the time past very quickly i would say a little too quickly,cruel
welcome back from the start of the film you know what you are going to get this is a bloody and violent film but they have done a great deal of home work not only the happenings in burma but the reality of how the weapons that are used in the film can be seen for the kind of damage they would do with the release of on dvd there are some good documentarys as well as deleted sense as a huge fan i must say that this is one of the best of the movies and is up the with first blood isworth a watch i have also heard the 5 is on the way if this is the case i hope they remember one thing plenty of body bags,cruel
contrary to the last instalment of rocky this sylvester stallones offering lives up to the expectations the movie is intense action  packed and utterly violent also it does not pretend to be something else than it actually is which is always a worthy quality another nice thing about is the way the main character evolved since the previous movie at 20 years older john is grumpier and even further disillusioned though still eager to fight for the good cause all that makes the story logical and water  tight which doesnt let the audience scratch their heads with disbelief the latest probably deserves a star or two more although i personally dont think that even a very good b  class movie should get that many this film certainly entertains with action possibly shocks with brutality but definitely doesnt let anyone stay neither indifferent nor bored,cruel
excellent movie films but these comments are really poor they call impresentabili 75 for a film of this sort is truly shameful exactly the same applies to itanic vote i am sure that most of those who have seen the film and have commented on this site have downloaded from the internet and drew their conclusions from ignorant but what meters of judgement you spoken with the alleged critics e shameful read on a website of its kind ratings so low push people not to consult more when the film came out in cinemas americans and europeans that a few weeks ago the judgement of this movie within this site was 87 now i did not understand why voting is precipitated in this way while the earlier have received very high ratings i believe that by a good slice of the alleged critics there is a certain nostalgia for the past and a ancoramento emotional films of the 80s the film is iperspettacolare more realistic a worthy successor of the series my vote is 85 for comments consider deleting the drafting and voting to raise 85 for those suspected reviewers but please go to follow the matches of rugby which is better,cruel
twentysix years after first blood john still hasnt found the peace of heart he needs to be able to return home and live out his old age living in a small fishermens village in thailand he fills his days catching and selling snakes one day a group of people comes asking his help they want him to take them into the next country by boat after an initial refusal the job is taken and it doesnt take long until the action startsstory wise this is both far and not far from the other three in the series violence wise its more or less the same a lot of people dying some rather graphically in most other aspects it is clearly a film while at the same time being something else isnt the same he was in the other films but i guess that might be deliberate hes a number of years older and probably more dark and grim behind the eyesi thoroughly enjoyed this film the build up is good not too long at all just enough to get the scenery settled in the action is very good just close enough to normal to keep it somewhat believable however the finale does seem a little bit over the top all in all good stuff8 out of 10 corpses shot to bits,cruel
this was the first movie i saw this was the first movie i ever walked out ofthe movie opens with violence expected then a marauding john then more violence then the missionaries come they offer the worst acting and worst dialog i have heard from a movie since the crocodile hunter movie i did not expect a scorsese movie i went to see this for the ridiculous overthetop action i saw in the redband trailer but good god almighty they could of at least not made the characters sound like the more you know commercials and the actors could have tried to make it sound like they werent reading off cuecards but that was just what made me offer to my friend that we could leave it was the assault on a village where i will now spoil 3 of the 100000000002 acts of violence in the movieit was when one child was shot graphically one was pushed to the ground and bayoneted graphically and a toddler was grabbed from her mothers arms and thrown into a burning hut that is when i walked out i am not scared of violence but that is not entertainment that is brutal and disgustingthe saddest part was looking back and seeing nothing but blank expressions on the audiences faces if we are desensitized to that that is sad this was one of the if not the worst movie i have ever seen it is a sad disgusting excuse for a movie bad plot bad dialog bad acting and disgusting violence,cruel
greetings again from the darkness john is back and he is as optimistic and jovial as ever i realize no one has ever anticipated the next movie because they couldnt wait to see how the storyline developed but come on  he is a cobra hunter and the skipper of a boat that makes the one in apocalypse now look like a yacht and a blacksmith who forges his own propeller ok those are the most believable parts of this storyafter that we are to believe a handful of godfearing goody twoshoes are heading into the burma war zone with only a couple of backpacks and just to top it off one of them is a bleached blonde who doesnt bother to chop off her shoulder length hair sorry  the point of is violence killing explosives etc there are loads of these things sometimes we arent even sure what is blowing up or why or who is dying and who is killing some la critic claims to have an accurate body count one thing is for sure he doesnt have an accurate body part count there are limbs flying throughout most of the movieif you are after blood and guts and explosions this one will deliver if just once you would like to know why  dont expect stallone actor writer director producer to let you know what could have been the coolest part of the movie and a perfect ending is just left dangling for 4 minutes over the closing credits who would have been the perfect r  john s dad since he is roughly 60 yrs old it would have to be a pretty old guy so most of the best choices are already dead john wayne robert mitchum lloyd bridges the best one i could come up with is hugh obrian  macho strong and silent sadly we are cheated out of even that bit of fun,cruel
starts in the river village of mae sot in thailand where john sylvester stallone earns a meagre living as a boatman he is approached by michael burnett paul schulze who works for a pan asian ministry church  is trying to lead a small team of volunteers up river north  into burma to deliver medical aid  relief for those caught up in burmas sixty year civil war reluctantly agrees takes the team into burma  than heads back while in burma helping people in a small village called klaw kbe lo it is attacked by the burmese military with many brutally killed  some taken prisoner word gets back to who then helps a small band of hired mercenaries to get the survivors back lots  lots of people start to diethis american german coproduction was cowritten produced  directed by himself sylvester stallone  one has to say i loved just about every gory minute of it the fourth film i must confess that out of the previous three i have only seen iii 1988 which i also loved  this one lives up to my high expectations the script by stallone  art monterastelli stays true to the character in these politically correct  sensitive times i love the fact by todays standards is a dinosaur as he doesnt believe in negotiation he doesnt believe aid workers can make a difference  he thinks to beat the bad guys you have to blow them all to pieces a simple yet undeniably effective philosophy of course the script also paints the opposite opinion with the aid workers trying to help  frowning on any sort of killing but luckily for the audience s pointofview wins out in the end  we are treated to some spectacularly gory  action packed setpieces which i thought were tremendously fun  entertaining the basic plot is pretty much the same as any action film the good guy has to stop the bad guys give or take a few minor differences like settings  motivation here the bad guys are very bad as they kill women children  babies they rape torture execute  abuse the innocent in some very graphic sequences so its even more sweet when turns the table on them  dispenses a bit of bloody retribution at just over 75 minutes the closing credits last near 10 minutes the film moves along like a rocket theres more than enough bloody violent action to keep most action junkies more than satisfied  the story is based around something that is actually taking place right now as i write this the civil war in burma which gives it a certain uneasy credibility although im not saying for one second is realistic in any way other than where its setdirector stallone does a fine job here he makes the nice looking locations work very well  he doesnt disappoint when it comes to the action has to be one of the most violent  bloody films ever to go into mainstream theatres people literally explode in a shower of blood  limbs arms are chopped off with machetes women children  babies are graphically killed people are hanged someone has both his legs blown off while someone else has his legs beneath his knees eaten by ravenous pigs theres rape theres loads of blood as head are literally blown off the backs of peoples heads explode everywhere limbs are blown  cut off  the scene at the end when climbs aboard the jeep with the huge gun on the back  lets rip is just one of the single greatest scenes ever in any film watch as all the bad guys explode everywhere if that isnt enough also rips someones throat out beheads someone with a machete  guts someone with a huge knife all in a days work i suppose according to the imdb this has a kill count of 236 which averages at 259 killings a minute there are also plenty of explosions  action as well all of the action scenes are well shot occasionally with a shaky camera but its always clear what is going on which is a factor many filmmakers seem to ignore these dayswith a supposed budget of about 50000000 is well made with high production values is apparently banned in myanmar formally burma by the military government which says something actually filmed in thailand the locations look very nice the acting is alright stallone was never the greatest actor anyway but he does fine here  plays with a nice bitter cynicism although he does look a bit old at times it never bothered me as he still looks in pretty good shapeis not a film for everyone its incredibly violent  some of the stuff the burmese military get up to may distress but in reality war doesnt care about race creed religion sex or age  i believe that merely tells it ok more like graphically shows it like it is if you like your action films violent then is the film for you if not then it isnt maybe the best film ive seen in 2008 so far,cruel
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen i would rather watch agent cody banks 2 than this piece of crap again stallone tries to glorify himself way too much in this role there are a few scenes where stallone and another character have a dialogue loaded with poor attempts at philosophy and dreadful lines repeated multiple times the violence is entertaining but you start to realize as the movie goes on its full of repetition and some stuff is just plain phonybasically all that characters say in this movie is corny bullshit and this movie is just plain terrible dont waste your money on this piece of crap,cruel
you can really see that this is a high budget thing technically well made all around stallone is great good thing that they made it now though any older and  well this time around hes great and does kick some serious ass the story can be told in four short sentences stallone is hired by some airheaded but otherwise good american missionaries to bring them into burma they are attacked and captured stallone is hired again to bring in a group of mercenaries that are supposed to get the missionaries out stallone kicks ass end in order to make a moral point the situation in burma is greatly simplified and we can all be sorry for the hapless missionaries and village dwellers as they are harassed by dehumanised killing machines of course we need that to enjoy slys crusade ms benz performance is nowhere near credible her character convinces sly to take the missionaries and then her contribution to the story ends the rest of the film she gets dragged along paul schulzes characters transformation is totally ridiculous and really should have been left out the english mercenary is a joke nuff said in conclusion i would recommend this film if you like violence and stallone and want to be entertained if you expect anything else like a story credible characters character development or an actual moral point youll be disappointed,cruel
i was waiting for this movie for a long timei love the movies especially ii and iii but to me iv doesnt fall into that categoryif you want to see top quality onscreen violence you should see that movie but if you are expecting the magic of a movie you will be disappointedstallone is too old and too fatyou wont see stallone with a naked upper body here for thishe is doing not much of the action in the movie himself because this time he has the help of mercenariesso i would say that the good old days when john killed his enemies all by himself mean and quietly are overin this movie stallone only fires a couple of arrows and a machine gunanother important thing that makes out a movie is the score i was again disappointed to hear the famous theme only at the beginning and the end of the filmthe lenght of the movie is something above 1h 20min which i find pretty short in the era of the 2 hour film on the other hand the movie compensates with unseen brutalitychildren murdered women raped heads chopped off body parts flying around and so onso i think stallone hit the right spot with the expectations of the audiencebut it takes more to make a real sequel than just to follow the main idea of showing violencestallone did good with the last rocky movie it was authentic which i cannot say of iv,cruel
just come back from seeing it  was very surprised at how good this movie was i ignored all bad reviews  persuaded my woman to come along how glad i was what an excellent movie this isa bit of advice ignore all bad reviewsstallone looks as fit as ever i hope i can run around like that when i am his age well done to the bloke he has done a great job on this movie  the effects are unreal on the blood n gutsthe main special effects which was an astounding piece of work was the big explosion absolutely awesomego and see it,cruel
a very short review of this movie can be following qahow would you define a action movie or what is a action movie ans john is the greatest action movie ever made its so freaking awesome movie from start to end you will feel the adrenaline flowing through your veins if i compare then i feel it stands out of the all movies especially 2 and 3 the difference between this movie and other recent action movies is the success here ever thought what kind of wounds you will get if you are shot by awp magnum rifle or what would happen if you put your feet on land mine these details are rarely covered in action movies you could find these only in war movies but thats different genre its very well balanced movie with lots of thinking done in script details the dialogues are awesome each dialogue delivered by is like a arrow shot in you heart the background score is awesome they will get you tears in your eyes sometimes its a must watch its a action movie with a message its like all action movies made in last decade are nothing comparable to itthe best part of the movie is its ending this is the best way to end the series watch it out you will also admire the ending partits up to you to experience itthis is the best action movie i have ever seen dont know about you guys just check it out it may well be your bestwhen youre pushed killings as easy as breathing  john rating for me its higher than 1010 long live ,cruel
is the manliest grungiest film you will ever witness what makes this film so exceptional is that everything depicted in the movie is happening in the real world right at this instant sylvester stallones rationale was to stir up awareness for burma if this movie does not give burma attention then nothing ever will the cinematography is tremendously well done so that you sense that you are there the entire time yet you can still at all times tell what your looking at not like other action films done in the same approach the music is powerful and doesnt sidetrack you from the film the acting is stallone at his best whether this movie gets bad reviews or not it will become a classic no doubt about it with its everlasting qualities,cruel
stallone goes into the burmese jungle to rescue human rights missionariesif you like nonstop shooting movies you are in luck that is all there is in here to be fair there are flashbacks to his earlier life which btw also involved more nonstop shooting and also to be fair i didnt care if the missionaries were rescued from the burmese army sometimes you see stupid people do stupid things and it may have been a better movie had they not have been rescued what am i giving something away everyone even the burmese army on the planet knows will rescue themlets face it we were all hoodwinked into thinking that this would be pretty good given the past movies and to be fair ok lets give it one more shot but in hindsight that shot could have been used for something else maybe a rocky 12 spiderman 7 indy jones 8 fantastic four 6 no dont go there its a very disappointing movie and it is not pretty good other things come to mind oh and one more thing doesnt always use guns and knives sometimes he uses a bow and arrows and to be fair hes pretty good with them violence yes sex no nudity some in crowd situations in the jungle hard to see anything language i think i did hear a couple fbombs in the beginning,cruel
sly made a strong comeback previous to this with his latest rocky installment however with he blew all my expectations out of the water and is a gigantic improvement to the really lame 3 is a return to form for the character and is the most like the 1st installment first blood is totally gritty ultra violent and dark character piece for stallone and he gives a tremendous performance which brings to mind my all time favorite movie unforgiven john is living in thailand and working as a snake handler he returns to action when julie benz and her group of christians are not heard from when they went to burma to provide aid and christian propoganda this brings to light the reality of genocide and civil war that is still ongoing in burma sly pulls no punches in his depiction of these events in this film and showcases extreme brutality by turning the bad guys to spaghetti is easily the bloodiest and goriest non horror film out there and delivers in bloodsoaked ultra violence this is the best installment since the 1st film and i cant wait to check out 5,cruel
if you want lots of action and stallone at his rocky we are going to beat the s out of the baddies best than this is the movie for you otherwise this movie is pure cheese it is all over the top takes a bunch of do good missionaries far up into thailand where the karen rebels are fighting the thai government despite his warnings off they go naturally the thai soldiers come along to clean out the village and we mean clean out even these soldiers give ethnic cleansing a bad name all the while laughing and guffawing their way to mass mayhem and murder the missionaries are spared for whatever reason maybe whiteys make good prisoners for later exchange who knows anyway is now being persuaded to go back and rescue the poor begotten missionaries with a merry band of mercenaries seemingly headed by one badass brit tension mounts between and the mercenaries and they want him to stay and hold the boat for them while they go off to rescue the missionaries from the evil thai soldiers naturally things go awry but dont worry comes to the rescue and the last part of the film is taken with more blood and guts blowing all over the place then one has probably ever seen in a movie too bad it all looks so gratuitous and downright silly laughable even anyway saves the female missionary from sure fire rape and pillage and the karen rebels arrive in the nick of time kind of like the old us cavalry arriving to save the white settlers from the evil indians and the day is saved and the body count mounts and mounts and mounts well you get the picture all we can say is its an adrenaline rush but dont expect a serious movie because it is all pure cheese and growls off into the sunset or whatever it is,cruel
having watched the other 3 s really surprised me that this one had absolutely no storyline at all no twist and turn just vini vidi vici or something like that comes shoots conquers the story is so basic completely predictable to the point that the whole movie is disappointing sure theres a lot of blood and violence which separates this movie a little bit from the rest but at least give the viewers some kind of story throughout the whole movie i kept telling myself theres gotta be more than this  just relax  theres gotta be a trick  nope  just plain abc shoot good guys win blah,cruel
this is the movie if someone say to you there is too much blood and blah blah blah do not mind him at all new is not about blood and gore sly tried to show us what is it to live in god forgotten contrives the violence is pure and explicit but this is probably how it is there the movie is absolutely great one of the best action movies ever and on top of this when you will hear the main song in the beginning there will be tears in your eyes and at the end of the movie you will feel sorry  because this is his last movie  the only bad thing about this movie is  its too short  but as i always say its better short and great than loooong and stupid hail to the kings,cruel
i got only one thing to say when i was watching the movie my heart was beating faster and fasterwhen i checked my pulse rate it was like 120125 omg but after some time when hold the machine gun i got some relief and it got slowersounded funny for me its a real carnage thing an action movie without nude scenes unlike james bondits simply mind blowingeffects are realistic actions are very well donebest one is when he put out someones through with bare handsomg after all he is sylvester stallonehe proved himself as a very talented action protagonist as well as action directorbut its simply a pure strong extreme action movie,cruel
the opening credits set the tone for the movie we get a montage of all the violence going on in burma rape murder mutilation you know within the first 5 minutes that this film is not going to be lighthearted it is dark far darker than any of the other filmsand is still bitter and upset with the world and it doesnt help that christian aid workers want him to take them up the river to burma so they can make changes he tells them they wont be making any changes if they dont have weaponsbut as the film needs a plot agrees to take them up to burma and from then on we get a suspenseful angering and a gorefest of an action film this movie is not cheesy at all no clever lines no crap just being i applaud sylvester stallone because while i believe he was trying to make the film entertaining as any filmmaker would do i honestly believe he was aiming to show the world what is going on in burma who would have thought that a movie could actually make us aware of the madness that is taking place in a lesserknown country i admit that before this film i hardly knew burma existedi dont have much else to say oh yeah the tagline is one of the best ever heroes never diethey just reload geniusif you are a fan an action fan or if you just like movies that are intense andor anger you i highly recommend this film,cruel
anyone who thinks that stallone is showing signs of ageing you couldnt be more wrong just watch this film for example finally i got to watch it and i loved it the story was thought provoking and has now retired from his tours of duty and living the life of a simple boatman on the rivers of thailand he also does a bit of side work providing snakes for daredevil in a thailand betting house hes living a relatively quiet life until he is asked to provide transport to dangerous burma of course nothing goes to plan and a few are brutally murdered and knows what he must do to get back the ones still surviving and the one way he can do that is release his now dormant retribution side good to see that even though stallone and have gotten older the power they both have still burns deep stallone does a great job as both and director he capture the action sequences beautifully and keeps them fresh and exciting possibly after starring in the first three movies he has obviously picked up tips from his fellow directors on how to make action scenes and war moments memorable and shocking the action scenes are tightly done stallone captures exactly what he wants to put up there on the screen and displays it with plenty of firepower theres explosions plenty of gunfights brutal violence and human drama which actually does shines through the violence stallone does exceptionally well in depicting the pure horror of burma these people are just pure evil there were several times in this that i winced at some of the things that they did they were truly vile and barbaric and i couldnt wait until got hold of them shows no emotion during the fight scenes and that sums up the person who really is a one man killing machine that executes with no mercy just like how the burma soldiers were with their pray well you know the old saying what comes around goes around and that what gives them a taste of their own medicine there is also a nod in this towards the people idea that is old and wornout when the mercs who have been organised to rescue the workers see wanting to join in the fight and tell him to stay with this boat as they think he is a simple minded boatman boy they couldnt be more wrong shows them exactly what he is capable of in spades stallones is backed up by some great performances from his carefully chosen cast julie benz does a great job in her role as sarah a christian aid worker who befriends to help them achieve their mission matthew marsden is great as schoolboy a merc with a powerful sniper rifle and i mean powerful graham mctavish as the lairy cockney sas sgt who i felt give londoners a bad name by the way that he treats the extras were exceptional as the nasty burmese soldiers they depict the right amount of malice that the real soldiers still have in burma and make you really hate them so much so we love it when they die for their horrible crimes everyone is going on about the violence in this movie yes its is shocking because its suppose to be unlike other hollywood films the violence is depicted in its rawest form to show you the viewer what horrors happen in that country its not sugar coated popcorn violence its real and thats how it is portrayed during some scenes with the innocent townsfolk being tortured raped and murdered by these burmese soldiers did get me so enraged that i had my fists clenched so tight in anguish that my knuckles went bone white they were just pure evil and i relished even ended up cheering when appeared and eliminated them in the only way he knows howwith extreme force i didnt find the violence excessive like everyone says it is maybe im becoming desensitised to violence in movies as i have seen it many times the violence in this film is necessary stallone wants the people of the world to see just what is going on over there right now as they sit in the cinema eating their popcorn the violence and horrific acts are vile vicious and vindictive so the violence that reciprocates back to them is entirely justified them soldiers deserved everything they got and they got plenty also has some scenes reminiscent to the first two movies the infiltration of the camp and the siege in the forest for example stallone takes every aspect of what of the fans love about the films and gives it fresh blood is a pure adrenaline thrill ride from beginning to end it doesnt lag or get boring and the action is in your face and comes thick and fast the only thing i didnt like about this film was it didnt seem very long and i felt sad when it ended i think that stallone still has a few more s in him although im not sure that he will be able to beat this one but i welcome another sequel shoot me again i aint dead yet,cruel
yesterday i watched john and i saw a simple one can sum up the plot in one longer sentence oldfashioned backwards oriented partly racist highly brutal revengemovie with first rate productionvalues and  i just loved itit was amazing what a movie i suddenly knew what i had missed for at least 2 decades exactly such a movie an old fashioned mindless revengemovie of the highest order a straightforward notwistwhatsoever nononsense and littledialog action flick where all the bad guys are killed like insects and of course we always have a stupid guy in the cast who calls killing bad per se ha ha after the bad guys are established as pure evil the movie doesnt even bother to translate their dialog anymore thats how unimportant they actually are before their doomed fate arrives in the person of john the killingmachine who openly admits early on that this is what he can do best  when has that been said openly in any other movie in recent years amazingthis is not the most brutal movie stallone has ever made this is  from the point of the excessive and graphic not psychological violence  the most brutal movie anyone has ever made i have never seen so many killings in one movie i guess it must contain several hundred killings maybe more than 500 and in such graphic detail the bullets not just kill they rip off limbs heads the bodies literally explode in fountains of blood and it is amazing how much fun this is to watch i would call this psychologically satisfying killingsof course stallone or whoever wrote the script must have studied the basics of revenge movies very well and paid close attention to the death wishseries esp part i and ii chatos land mr majestyk the outlaw josey wales only the beginning smile etcjohn is a wonderful simplistic what you see is what you getmovie and one knows right from the start whats gonna happen but thats exactly why i loved it so much no damn shitty twists somewhere in between no unexpected turns just exactly what one expected i suddenly knew why i had grown so incredibly tired of todays thrillers everyone of them tries to invent the genre new no one can simply celebrate the standard plot at top level everyone tries to be somehow new john does not try this not a second and thats what makes watching it so refreshingfirst you have the bad guys introduced in typical form they kill obvious innocents with fun thats bad of course their chief wears sunglasses the ones you know bad guys wearing since the times of cool hand luke the bad guys smile when they kill for them it is a game nothing morea little later you see them kill again a whole village unarmed people killed in dozens young old women even children very graphic the viewer gets angry here at the latestbut john presents the bill it not a spoiler and no secret of course that the bad guys all get killed thats what revenge is all about and the way he does it is at level with the way the bad guys killed their victims as already pointed out they are not just killed but bombed hacked slashed to pieces thats emotionally satisfying killingthe production values are first rate thats what makes john differ a lot from other movies of that type usually in these movies to which i am referring you know chuck norris and similar junk most of the fx is poor belowpar party unwatchable here this is all absolutely first rate and it does not look computergenerated i have no idea if it is but i guess some parts must be a hell of a fun to watch the bad guys bodies being ripped apart in wonderful detail and although the story is clear from the first few minutes when john is asked to guide them aiders upriver still the tension never breaks or has a letdown as such movies typically have this has a running time from nearly precisely 90 minutes but it is nevertheless not easy to keep watchers glued to the seat for 90 minutes john manages that despite the predictability of the storylinei call this an achievementi have not left any movie since gibsons apocalypto 2006 that thrilled and uplifted the good ones win the bad ones die it is that simple in apocalypto only a part of the bad ones die but in john not a single bad guy survives its a blood feast a blood bathi just wish sly would make no 5 because all the great series have 5 parts be it death wish be it dirty harry but also of course rocky however i doubt it well see a 5 because how to top this i would  for my humble part  be already happy with another equally great achievement but as economic rules have it today every follow up must be more excessive than the last part but how to achieve this here  its better to let the series end at its peak 4 is definitely better than 2 and 3 and equally good as no 1 than to risk the die hardfate die hard iv was mostly unwatchable just terrible silly boring complicated which is already an achievement of its own type btwjohn avoids all that it is onedimensional simple basic and straightforward but these are its strengths this is exactly why it succeeds on every level a masterpiece in simple but effective storytelling definitely the best since apocalypto  1010 go see it  at least if you have a healthy stomach that is ,cruel
critics hate it seems to me that in modern days people judge whether if a film is worthwhile by several factors 1 complex story line 2 cgi effect 3 plots with twistspersonally i dont really appreciate any of the factors i listed above besides cgi effect the truth is i often find modern day films films made in the last 5 years contain complex story line and characters yet without any sort of motivation or purpose movies such as the bourne trilogy 300 or any of those movie that preach the idea of how to live a better life movies are essential empty in essencejust like rocky balboa both contains one dimensional characters and story line is a exsolider who is haunted by his past war experience and has somehow lost faith in everything in this world yet in the end he was able to come to realise that he should use his ability as a war machine to bring about some change in this world even if it is just saving one couples lifethe film also exposed what really is happening in burma while the world is focusing on the middle east for the interest of oil people forget that there are other places in the world that deserve if not more equal amount of attention from the international community and exposed this truth to everyonetherefore i think this is actually one of the most purposeful movie since rocky balboa last yeara 77 at imdb is an insult this film deserves at least an 85,cruel
a bigger conceived for the new generation more violent and brutal but with a different spirit from the one of its predecessors stallone is less believable of course hes more aged than 60 on the other hand and gives the impression of being focused too much on the past rather than on the future in some respects the story and the scripts are even ridiculous but its exactly what the audience expected it to be after so many years of waiting moreover s reinvention could have been less full of prejudices against the asians but on the other hand biases were necessary for justifying such a bloodshed fortunately this one has been the last of the saga,cruel
well  i was really eager to watch iv because i liked the first three i must say i was somewhat disappointed not so much with the background of the movie than with the main character i mean he is an old man for christs sake he shouldnt be playing roles that involve fast running jumping etc sooner or later hes going to hurt his knees or something not to mention his long black hair that really do not fit his old face but enough badmouthing of the star of the film the movie was not all that bad the special effects were something of a joy to watch bullets tearing the limbs of a body blood squirting all over the place the story was fine at most but you cannot expect an oscar winning story from a film such as i just wish they would have considered cutting stallones hair and leaving it a little grayish it would have been a hell of a lot more realistic,cruel
this is clearly not going to be to everyones taste although the only reason im writing this is because of the negative reviews look one guys says stallone looks anorexic hes the biggest guy in the film stallone looks like a monster i dont think he was that big in the first two films secondly you said people walked out after five minutes because it was so violent my god its what did you expect and also whoever said that stallone had to make it simply to push out enough films you really dont know what youre talking aboutto sum up if you like the old movies general action movies or the fact a 61 year old legend still has what it takes to keep making raw powerful action movies then you wont be disappointed,cruel
if your looking for this to take off where iii left off think againthis is a differentolder and more somber in the 00s with saving private ryannormandy beach scenetype violenceextreme violence way more serioushardly any humor or snappy oneliners at allif anyin fact very sad and disgustingly sadistic the bad guys are in thisan army of burmese revolutionariesreal bastards the 80s cheeseball stuff gets left at the front gatevery violent and very seriousim gonna see this again in the theater this is fantasticviolent cinemaand boy do the bad guys get it stallone should direct more in this fashionwith more realistic violence and less outofplace humor2008 kicks butt,cruel
coming from a guy who watched the trailer online at work every single day since it was released there was really no way i could have been disappointed here however sly took my appreciation to a whole new level the gritty realism of war torn burma was shocking and sobering slys ability to carry the film and its drama with just his body language and facial expressions were uncanny he didnt need shakespearian dialogue when you look at his face you know what he is feeling i will see this movie as many times as i possibly can simply because the more it makes the more respect he will receive and to me thats the important thing i am tired of hearing all this  worst actor ever crap sure like many actors he has had some bombs but he has put himself out there and never bowed to the critics amazing moviebottom line,cruel
if you love action with a bit of a political twist has it for you in spades the monosyllabic flawed but idealistic hero is back big time john is living in thailand eking out a living catching snakes renting out his boat looks like the african queen and working as a blacksmith when christian missionaries including a doctor  dentist etc ask him to take them into burma behind the lines of one of the most blood thirsty dictatorships in the world refuses he tells them to go home but like any good christian missionary they decide they want to go anyway obviously the blood thirsty slime capture them and the pastor of their church asks to take some mercenaries in to find them and bring them home those scummy bad guys should have never fooled around with people john likes the story is often gruesome and blood soaked but not boring there are positive messages of loyalty well intentioned missionaries a mercenary who decides to go beyond the call and that bad guys will eventually get their just punishment and you can enjoy it all,cruel
lets make this simple plot the plot definitely makes sense its not so intricate that it requires thought but its also not so dry that it was entirely a hollywood clichacting all of the characters in the movie were well acted out they made you feel as if you were there all along watching things as they unfolded there was only one character that ruined the movie for me but he wasnt significant enough to merit my criticism of the filmdirection this is where i took off a star from the movie stallone could have helped direct the actors and the plot to one more level because there were so many directions all happening simultaneously it would have been too difficult to develop everybody to the level that the movie would have required just with the complexity of everything furthermore the main audience that this movie was intended for would not want that much thought out of a film or so that would be my assumptionbottomline i know i have negated my own reasoning for why this film is not fantastic but i was not impressed amused thats a different story i would recommend this film for those who want a movie to pass time after all its a film that means lots of bangs for your buck in the theaters,cruel
this movie took me by absolute surprise because not only is this a very solid action movie but its one of the best films of the year by far we all know who is and his history as well as his story its a little more of the same here but stallone incorporates clips in some parts of the movie with old footage from the previous entries however you may ask yourself does stallone still have it i mean hes 60 well to answer youre question yes hes still fin got it even though his face looks a little deformed and he looks way bigger but he can bring some action and gore stallone as john resides in thailand as a snake wrangler for a snake amusement park and owns a small wooden boat he is in thailand minding his own business when a couple of americans from utah have come to ask to help them get to burma where they plan to aid the people with supplies after going there they are captured by a burmanese militant group and held captive for 10 days let the action ensue from here because from here on its all blood gore heads blown off bits and chunks of humans flying all over and a lot of bullets trust me guys this is one movie you must see to add to your manliness or help transform you into a man but all in all this is a great action film and should be seen but proceed with caution if you intend to bring kids or a girlfriendwifefianc that cant handle lots of gore and blood,cruel
i love mindless action movies so i love but this one was much more violent than the previous three movies i guess thats because of the modern advancements in special effects which were obviously not possible in the earlier moviesfor those who like action and violent action at that cannot afford to miss this go now and watch it this movie is fast bloody explosive gory and full of endless action sequences people believe that as sly is so old now there would be no point in making a movie at this point of time but he sure has proved all of you wrong believe me he still has it even after so many years he proved it in rocky balboa and he has done it again with this onehis performance was amazing and even lookswise he still has those muscles the acting by others was also very good specially julie benz and the guy who played the british mercenary his dialogs were funnyso all in all a must watch for all sly fans and action fans in general,cruel
i went in to this movie expecting it to be great i saw how even after 20 years stallone can make a miracle such as he did in rocky balboa stallone completely blew me away in this film this movie takes action and explosions mixed with blood and guts and lightly sprinkles a little bit of drama on top not only will this movie keep you on the edge of your seat it will keep you amazed that even after 20 years stallone can stay in shape we never get to see stallones bare chest like in the previous s but you can clearly see his bulging arms and veins if you want blood you got it if you want suspense you got it if you want explosions and violence you need to go see this film today you will not be disappointed at all if you are only going to see it to make fun of it go see it you will be surprised you may end up liking it after all live for nothing or die for something your call,cruel
wow i went and saw with very high expectation and was i ever impressed stallone did a great job on rocky and topped it with there was a lot of violence but it portrayed some of the real issues that some countries face today there was some powerful scenes in the movie and for those who have watched it you know which ones i mean the supporting cast was chosen perfectly to a tee if you are looking to see some action with some powerful dialect go and have a blast this was probably one of the few movies that i felt that i got more then my moneys worthif you are thinking about seeing it do yourself a favorand goyou will not regret it stallone is in top form 1010,cruel
i was lucky to catch this movie not at the premiere or something but at the 3rd day of playing in my city im saying i was lucky because the theater was packedand boy do i understand why im not bothering with going into the story as you already most likely know it browsing through the profile for this movieme and my stepbrother were discussing after we saw it and we can not remember the last time we experienced something like this in a movie theater this movie is pure action nuff saidnorwegian movie critics have bashed this movie calling it ultra violent and virtually devoid of plot and characters yes i agree but that is also what makes it a totally sweet 93 minutes of sheer entertainment last weekend i went to see atonement and 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days in the theater plenty of drama great acting and real human emotion i had to think and pay attention and i was rewarded because i felt good when leaving the theater knowing i had witnessed artbut reward comes in more than one wrapping i was rewarded after because i got to have a blast in the theater laughing at some of the extreme violence its so extreme you can do nothing but laugh at least i did being shook by sustained gunfire and an especially jawdropping explosion clearing about a half a square mile of jungle vegetation the list goes on in short i was rewarded because i had a damn good timethere is nothing wrong with being entertained by morally ambiguous motion pictures like this one as long as you acknowledge it as just that this isnt the godfather pt 2 or dr zhivago or something in that league this is and if you dont know that youre about to witness some carnage while walking to your seat youre in for a surpriseif it wasnt for the sustained gunfire the 50 calorgy devastating sound effects visceral bloody bloody action and sheer asskicking this would have scored 210 in my book the acting is what youd expect after all stallone is the mostnominated actor for razzie awards the script is anorexic and not in that arthaustype way and the running time is quite short id say but so what you know this going in and youre going because of the actionif you have a very weak stomach or cant stand blood decapitations or scattered limbs dont watch itif you have a strong stomach common sense telling you this isnt real and the inclination to be entertained by an largerthanlife avalanche of violence then watch this movie its one hell of an experience  damien,cruel
i saw over the weekend and i was thoroughly impressed i am a big fan of the films and stallone films in general so my opinions are probably going to be a bit biased but i think most people would agree with me when i say this is a great action moviei gave a 10out of 10 rating because i think this movie was created to achieve a certain goalto convey a message about the atrocities going on in myanmar formerly called burma and at the same time conclude the story of one of americas most famous and popular pop culture icons in my opinion that goal was met with taste with dignity and with a lot of heart and hard work from sylvester stallone and his crew the movie is superbly entertainingthe story is believable the action is intense the sounds effects are excellent and the acting is on par its an excellent film that i would definitely watch againif you havent seen it yet i highly recommend it excellent job sly,cruel
i love sylvester stallone and his great this movie is a great return of the hero john the timing of this movie couldnt be better now the movie has delivered what everyone had expected and even more even the pickiest ones came out of the theater with a stupid smile on their facessly kicked ass as usual and his performance never came short the others were ok too the action scenes where great and did the killings like the way he always does but he was even more brutal on the enemies this time this movie is so far the best action movie in 2008 lets sees what the future brings there are many good action movies on the way this yearthis movie is a must seen for all you lovers god bless p,cruel
i was expecting this movie to completely sucked since it was murdered by critics and commercials looked so cheesy stallone getting too old him admitting taking human growth hormones so i expected this movie to totally bomb but too my surprise like rocky balboa this movie wasnt too badstoryline wasnt bad when you take a look of these kinds of movies your not expecting any storyline at all but surprisingly there was a little storyline and it wasnt too bad film seemed kind of short though but then you run the danger of making it too longsimiliarlly to rocky balboa got some character by them adding flashbacks from the previous movies in it considering he didnt say much in this movieall and all not a bad movie i gave this movie an 8 out of 10 maybe too high,cruel
i have just returned home from seeing i cannot remember the last time i saw a film in a theater and left feeling so exhilarated was a fantastic return to form for the classic action movie in theme content and philosophy yes there have been actionoriented films of late but they have dealt with superficial issues created by consumerdriven societies drugs bank heists jewel thievery the mob to name a few returns to the era of the action film that seeks a universal and compelling motivation for its bloodbaths in this case genocide in burma sets the stage is unafraid to take a stance on not only genocide but mission work all while it blasting past it in a blur of unabashed violence creates one of the bestorchestrated action sequences on film over the course of 20 minutes near its end in terms of the quality of its bloodletting it makes movies hailed for their gore like reservoir dogs saving private ryan and pulp fiction pale in comparison heads are blown off bullets rip through bodies flamethrowers blast rebels bloated corpses float in pools of stagnant water land mines explode humans in fountains of blood arrows sink through heads hands rip flesh apart fire burns flesh and fiery explosions take care of most of whats left yet with the amazing noise and struggle contained in this movie viewers will be engaged by the struggle the resolve and stoic killer impulses embodied in himself simply put this movie with stimulate your nerves and senses all while drawing you into its tale an excellent film,cruel
there is no real plot no real character development and little dialogthe plot can be summed up as some bad guys capture some good guys and a team of mercenaries have to go save them and a lot of people die along the way but it still works why because it doesnt try to be anything other than what it is which is a graphic nonstop violent kill fest the bloodthirsty will love this movie i havent seen a movie this violent and graphic in quite some time the killing starts a couple minutes into the movie and doesnt stop for the next 90 minutes this is exactly what we want in a movie and stallone delivers big time it really feels like at times we are watching real battles take place imagine the intensity of the opening sequence of saving private ryan there are several parts of the movie that are that cool and that intense dont listen to the critics who are trashing this movie this kind of movie is never going to get good reviews from the critics listen to those who have seen it if you liked previous s youll like this one,cruel
my family and i went to see the much anticipated sequel to another stallone movie im a huge fan rocky too i was somewhat prepared for the blood and gore because of reviews id read months b4 the release however as a woman it was hard to watch the bloody scenesis blood really that red when people get blown to bitsbut as the movie went on i didnt notice as much all i could do was cheer on while he scrambled thru rainsoaked thailand terrain with his mercenary rescue force i enjoyed watching the small tidbits of insight into the of first bloodhis battles w enemies and himself a battle which if u manage to notice above the action he finally wins what a fitting end to a sad story which im sure has been a reality to many men who have served their country i have read many reviews here and for the life of me i cant figure out how anyone would find anything amusing about this film yes sly is 61 and not as supple as he was but did u c his armslaugh at that it is a blow up shoot up gut decapitate mutilate a c t i o n film nothing funny about it no its not oscar material but who caresits bravo sylvester,cruel
after a 20 year absence returns to the screen triumphantly but this is a film one should seriously not bring the kids tothe film is set in the current burmese civil war and the atrocities that are actually happening in real life are being translated to the screen as faithfully as is humanly possible and many reviews have made note of this even likening the gratuitous violence to porn this isnt entirely correct as stallone himself has said that it was to draw attention to the terrible plight of the people of burma and no matter how intense the movie gets its even worse in real lifethe film picks up with john living in thailand growing old and trying to forget his past he spends his days doing odd jobs fishing and catching snakes for tourist shows his nights are haunted by nightmares of his violent past a group of christian missionaries come along asking for help to get their medical supplies into burma reluctantly agrees giving them a lift in his boat up river a group of burmese soldiers headed by a sadistic officer capture and torture the missionaries is enlisted to ferry a group of hired mercenaries up river to where the hostages are held feeling that he must go too essentially takes the lead and through force of will manages to not win per se but bring a little shade of humanity to an otherwise inhuman situationthe film is not like the others in the series oneliners are virtually nonexistent only a handful of nuggets are included as homage to the earlier entries stallone in fact keeps the talk to the minimum preferring to turn the inner turmoil of his character into a thousand yard stare that also conveys a feeling of conflict although most characters are underdeveloped we dont need the back story of their lives we only see them for the few hours that they exist within the film the acting is good with each actor bringing the necessary gravitas and when called for humanity to their roles and the action and stunts are mostly done the old fashioned way with cgi virtually unseengo see it but dont bring the young impressionable or squeamish,cruel
cut the crap the fixation on pg13 films and their potentional to be blockbusters has ruined the industry the 80s had the best actionhorror movies of all time why because they provided us with what we really wanted unapalogeticif thats a word politically incorrect trash filled with boobs graphic violence and exploitation they didnt make a billion dollars but they left a mark i dont want anything to do with the xxx or tomb raider franchises i want real action and yes i want make no mistake this movie is fun will it sweep the oscars no but its more fun than the english patient and it provides us with we really want graphic violence horrible bad guys and a happy ending exactly what we want in american cinema see this movie and enjoy thank you sly,cruel
i just had a chance to see this film this afternoon i have to say this is one of the best action movies i have seen in the last 10 years this is a refreshing return to real action and violence that is not shy by any means i was impressed with the action sequences and revenge factor and the ending was great as well the mercenaries were great especially the guy with the huge friggin sniper rifle i will try not to ruin the movie for anyone great job sly i give this 1010 for a strictly action film this will not wins oscars but it was entertaining this was a great movie and i hope you make more films or maybe even a sequel sly,cruel
stallone has done it again this film earns every bit of its r rating and thats refreshing in a day where pg13 mass appeal films flood the marketplace there has been a void in the action genre and this film comes right from the trenches yes the violence is shocking brutal and obscene but guess what that is what is currently going on in that area of the world this film asks the question of how civilized nations can turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed in areas like burma thank you mr stallone for bringing amazing violent action to the screen with a very poignant relative message i look forward to more of your films,cruel
next time a movie comes out i wont read the critics they are spoilers anyways was just one heck of a movie being a fan and owner of the dvd collection i must say this should be put on dvd as soon as possible and added the action was great non stop very simple story line and meaningful catchy phrases i must say sly looks great at 62 and his acting and directing job was just excellent a lot of people thought this would be a bust but hell no proved you wrong i hope more sequels like this come and i really hope a v doesnt come out iv is enough long live ,cruel
i first went into this movie thinking about how awful rocky balboa was and had my mind set on disappointment i switched opinions as soon as the movie begins this is definitely the best installment in my opinion not only did john blow my mind when he first unleashed his bow and gave many merciless whacks to the face with his machete but he had a team of pure bad ass behind him through the last hour of the movie my favorite of team was lewis portrayed by graham mctavish who even after having his leg blown off has the energy to head butt someone in the face take their gun and proceed with more domination this movie will have you screaming holy crap and hell yea until the end credits roll this is definitely the most action packed movie ive seen in years and if you havent seen any of the movies it wont matter being sheerly a raw chunk of manly action and blood previous story of the old is basically unnecessary bottom line on this movie is if you go see it prepare for your ass to get rocked and your dick to get bigger it was the definition of kick ass manly cinema in the new millennium i loved it,cruel
i went into with low expectations ive seen enough remakes and sequels that didnt do their predecessors justice and being a huge action fan i was concerned let me just say that i left smiling if you want a complicated plot and academy award winning acting go see a morgan freeman movie if you wanna see the most digital blood since 300 sly has it waiting for you i was keeping a kill count just to see how it stacked up against the other ones i gave up when it hit the triple digits arnolds kill count was only in the 90s in commando you know you know what to expect machete kills and digital decapitations,cruel
is back and hes more than the punchline or an homage to previous 80s bullet fiestas many feared he would be in full control of the movie stallone has given us a who has finally come to terms with what he is the unholy paragon of 20th century warfare death incarnatethe movie starts with just enough back story to deftly draw us in and care a little about the pusum missionaries and their plight after that its all all the time pistol arrows machete barehands 50 cal machine gun claymore giant bomball tools he uses to paint his masterpiece celebrates blood head shots and action heroics in the same way shoot em up did last year although with a bit more of an attempt at heart and realism the supporting cast is solid and injects all the humor and pathos needsif youre going to the movies for anything but classic american asskicking i suggest you park your sensitive rear next door to this flick maybe see 27 dresses i hear katherine heigl might hookup with her longtime platonic friend and maybejust maybe learn something about life and love in the process,cruel
in thailand john sylvester stallone is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat when a group of christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in burma to help the locals the reluctant only accepts when sarah miller julie benz presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission leaves the group in the requested location but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of major pa tee tint maung maung khin the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted later a member of their church meets and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries4 is a great action movie if not the best of the franchise at least in the same level of first blood the story is simple actually there are many other movies with a group of mercenaries assigned to rescue prisoners in a jungle crowded of enemies however there is a nonstop action with violent scenes lots of gore shootings and explosions great special effects and an extremely dangerous hero that lives for nothing and decides to risk his life and if necessary die for something professional critics will certainly hate this movie i have seen statistics in internet about the violence in the story but i really did like it my vote is seventitle brazil 4,cruel
this came on directv and i started watching there was almost no plotjust violence and gore children were tossed into fire people were set on fire women were gangraped people were crucified to be eaten by wild boarswhy would anyone civilized want to watch this you can just turn on the news this gave me nightmares and i swerved toward the bathroom to vomitsylvester stallonethe steroidal midgelooks gross hes only abut 55 it is doubtful that he will ever outgrow these violent moviesnot so long as violence thirsty people pay to see them indeed we live a world that is desensitized by violence i wonder how many people who commented here will go out and do something violent because they no longer know its wrong,cruel
as its own its a very mediocre movie no deep plot no good idea some good effects and no emotional or spiritual deepness rocky 6 was very emotionally attached to the previous movies and thus was a wonderful end to the series 4 had some flashbacks from the past but nothing more it was very artificially connected to the ploti expected much more in this area i dont want to spoil but in the end of the movie i would get something of the linkage and nostalgia i expected but it was too short and especially too cheapits a pity they havent followed the principles from rocky 6if youre fans id suggest you to watch it but expect little or maybe not to watch at all if youre hardcore fans whore afraid of reputation loss if you just like to watch an ok action war movie so go for it stallone acted well to my mind,cruel
john sylvester stallone  the name sounds so much nice memories of movies that we loved and enjoyed especially the series  rocky and the last hopefully of rocky series was released last year and followed in the footsteps just as a tribute to the old legendary hero i went ahead to see this time the setting is in burma  the ruthless junta government and sylvester stallone is asked to help some missionaries who want to go and help some villagers helps them to reach the remote burmese villages but goes full fledge into his usual combat mode when the missionaries are kidnapped after lots of gun battle and fights finally the missionaries are saved and the troop of junta government killedthere is not much to the story and the narrative is also something picked out from eightees the added stuff here is the videogame version of killing shown on screen which is appalling and unnecessarysylvester stallone tries to bring back his usual mannerism  cold and angry style but to vain those times are gonebynothing much to write about this bloodied movie which is directed by stallone himself i think by going ahead and making rocky and again  at his age stallone has tried to prove a point to someone who knows to whom  but the output is not as good as we would have expected from stalloness we want to see you revived in a new genre of cinema that suits your age profile and cinema that is todays  intelligent and contemporarystars 2 out of 10,cruel
theres a lot to be excited about when deciding to watch this movie such asextreme violence great special effects  sound extreme violence actually thats about it of the very short 133 minute film theres 15 minutes of great footage beyond that youre getting an uninteresting story of ramblow the mysterious ultra invincible tragic hero who is willing to sacrifice everything to save a woman and her christian missionary friends the acting of julie benz who played the female lead really left a bad taste in my mouth i honestly felt stallone gave a pretty gritty performance and was easily the most convincing of everyone in fact each scene with ramblow in it i was highly captivated when he wasnt involved my mind wandered quicklymy main beef is the horrible story i just felt like its been done a million times and really had a hard time staying interested there are several scenes that will have you saying holy hit but theyre so few and far between that its not worth it to suffer through the hour and 15 minutes of garbageeven to fans of 80s shoot em up action flicks which is the audience this clearly is targeting i would not recommend seeing this go watch blood diamond or apocalypse now if you want to see something similar but better510,cruel
someone needs to tell sly its time to either kill off or put it to rest this saga is starting to drag this film is no different than the sequels since part ii with lots of blood and gore for a guy that was haunted by war as clearly was in first blood he seems to have no problems since then accepting missions as some cold blooded mercenary for hire that involve a lot of explosions dead bodies lots of blood guts flying all over stabbings and whatever else can think up to kill someone i guess he is over his post dramatic stress disorder first blood was a stylish film that at least made some sense i mean it is plausible that some viet nam vet or someone haunted by war can be pushed to the limit and almost destroy a small town now is nothing more than some killing machine that i no longer sympathize with,cruel
this movie was clearly made for the call of duty crowd and its terrible to see this rated a 72 let me summarise the movie bloodgorebad actingboring and 50 cal the main draw to seems to be the gore and let me say there are far more gorier movies this movie sold well just because of the hype to the violenceif you want violence and blood look at horror films not id rate the movie 2 out of 10 but am awarding it a 1 to try and even out the scoreand for people who will say i cant handle the gore or some crap like that im saying the gore here is very tame,cruel
if you want to see people getting killed in numerous ways like heads blown off ripped to pieces fed to swines ripped throats legs shot off and whatever your heart might desire our your brain might come up with this movie is for you because this is what it is all aboutyes of course its exciting but its very boring at the same time in terms of craftsmanship is a fairly good piece of action cinema but the rest whatever that might be is pretty stupid really really evil asian army kills and rapes and johnnyboy kills them all in return end of storyby the way live for nothing or die for a reason is a really stupid cognition for somebody who just found out that he didnt do all the killing for his country but just for himselfnow go out and slay your own,cruel
granted right off the bat they did include the situation in burma sad that it ishowever that at best was a lame ass attempt to inject political commentary as well as an attempt to boot the movies ratings with current real world eventsnow as for the best of the series i cannot disagree more my uncle a former green beret sniper and highly decorated officer thought the original was adequate portrayal of reality of post viet nam effects upon some of the veteransafter he did 9yrs voluntarily since he was canadian he did not have any obligation to do so in any way shape or form he simply thought it was the right thing to do at the time and after loosing his  fianc to a 8yr old suicide bomber in hanoi i do believe he certainly earned the right to comment upon any vnera films accuracyi as a veteran as well give full credence to his opinion on such matters though i was not a vet of vn i am simply too youngas for the latest film personally i find it an embarrassment for stalone he could have done far better julie should truly hide in shame especially shes a very competent actress and this frankly is way beneath her ability shame on you julie for accepting this pile of crap with your name on itsuffice to say the original had merit due to it actually having a well written story as well as real meaning everything since then in this pathetic excuse for a franchise has well been total crapproof you ask simple how bad does a film or series of films as in this case have to be to make the joke watch kill everyone on the entire planet and not even reload once almost universally a household joke honestly the sfx were over done plot absolutely lost it only 14 of the way throughin the end its complete drivel action it has unbelievable bs levels it has but real writing f no for that youll have a better chance of finding such on sesame streetohh and thanks soooooooo much for the very very lame imdb censor scripting prohibiting a real world description of this r rated movie apparently they are the new f word police even for an adult movie how pathetic,cruel
i was never a fan of these films to begin with but with one of the more brutal and compelling trailers behind it the nasty youtube one not the tv spots i decided to give it a whirl unfortunately what turned me off on previous outings was the lethargic pacing sure when the explosions are in fullforce and sly is dramatically rising behind a baddie to gut him theres life or mass death but as with the other incarnations this needed a serious kick in the butt in terms of story developmentfirst time around twentyfive years ago it was the northwest then nam lastly afghanistan here stallones hero emerges outside of burma in exile when bothered by a group of american aid workers common sense gaffes are what distracted me to begin with how this group of people are so hellbent on entering a territory where they are sure to be dead within 24 hours why not pick a more reasonably safer land with starving kids or hurricane victims something but the film needs to provide something for to fight for so it leads to a predictable setup with the fools administering aid for all of ten minutes before a siege of bulletridden carnage has them held hostageol john is then visited by the aid workers boss to help rescue them this results in my second complaint a band of mercenaries is hired to help help this guy works alone thats like giving superman a buddy to tag along and to top it off the band of hired guns includes a hateful whining leader you cant even stand i dont know if stallone wrote these guys in to take some of the physical burden off of him or what but any way you slice it the film is brought down because of itthen we arrive at the action sequences which are carried off adequately stallone whos always been underrated as a director orchestrates everything quite well save for some chaotic dramamine camera wildness its nicely photographed some have complained of the violence but i was more distracted by the use of the dreaded cgi limbs and torsos and heads eviscerated in large amounts with obvious inserted blood was annoying the big finale was something of a letdown as well punctuated by a redundant 17minute montage of machinegun firestallone dusting off and trotting out his nearmute loner motif isnt as annoying with that character as in some other films still in great shape and wholly capable of jumping around in the rain and can this guy still run lots of footwork involved in this jungle effort and his age doesnt show in the slightesti didnt hate the film mind you its brutal realism of wartorn areas and the psycho nutbags that seem to exist only to rape and execute is graphically displayed but following such a dynamic triumphant and frankly kickass trailer apparently is too much for this film to live up to plus a dose of needless characters and wrongheaded motives will leave this out of my dvd collection months down the line,cruel
dumbo john j is back working as a blacksmith though not so much as a tired mule is anywhere in sight but this dreary shootemup series is certainly tired while stilllackluster staclown shows up looking like somebodys fat unclethe bodycount for this time is 93 six of which felt he had to kill with a nuclear explosion complete with a mushroom cloud the film is saturated with unrecognizable elements not found in the other movies including terrible computer animation that was used to show enemy bodies being mutilated and staclown himself who appears in this flick overweight and just way too old to still be screwing around as the cheap comic book war machine hes always tried to bethe only question here is why would take a stupid woman julie benz to a war zone where he knows shes going to be captured and raped 100 times,cruel
going to cinema i expect to see a movie now a movie usually has to have some key elements a plot for example even a simple plot will do when the genre calls for it but simple and tinkered on because someone thought this better have something like a plot too still make a difference and thats pretty much what we get here during watching this solid shot jungle massacre nothing else happens people get massacred thats about it even the unwillingly comic 3 tried to tell about the fate of the people of afghanistan how the outsider walks in and sees a part of himself there about loyalty regarding trautman etc has no such elements the characters do not develop they are just put in place because they need to serve the purpose of leading to the next scene goes for both parties trying to pull the theworldneedstoseethisstring about the burmese people looks a lot like monterastelli and stallone sat together and said oh about the setting we pick some war zone country were some farmers are roughed up and killed on a regular basis by some army oppressors any will doif you want to see a grade a massacre with lots of blood gore decapitation people blown up seeing through gun shot wounds and whatnot this is definitely a film you wanna watch if like the old 80s90s mixtures of action violence story border of credibility pushed repeatedly and hardboiled antiheroes turning semigod better cram out first blood,cruel
this movie was unreal it brings to mind one of the late scenes in billy madison everyone in this room is now stupider for having seen  heard it the weird frame rate during the action felt like a madonna music video although the bloody destruction is different it is essentially a very socially irresponsible movie that lets every kid think if i was in the right situation killing is easy as breathing and dont take my word for it it really puts down the antiviolence guy but the dialog was hilarious i honestly didnt see the new rocky i think i will now i am genuinely curios enough i guess the smart people weed it out anyway if you got thick skin go see this piece of garbage,cruel
good lord whats stallones mental age this movie is idiotic ive never seen a dumber movie since i stopped watching ninja action flicksthe bad guys are so bad theyre laughable the mercenaries are walking clichs the missionaries are straight out of the singing nun and stallone well hes stallone the guy cant act and he doesnt speak he mumbles julie benz is eye candy but her character is a complete idiotthe whole movie can be summarized as 40 minutes intro followed by 40 minutes of senseless violence ive got nothing against violence in movies but this is a pure massacre without any purpose except blood splattersonly one funny thing  there is a huge typo in the credits armourer is spelled amoureur  for a french guy like me its hilariousoh and the movie is made in thailand with a local crew so not only did they make a dumb flick but they did it for cheap thats the way of the future lets outsource the crappy work to asia  a movie to watch on evenings after your brain has overheated  no risk of additional pressure on the neurones,cruel
this movie is incredibly strange even the most pointless bgrade actioner has some feeling of purpose i read the interviews about how this was supposed to convey the horror of war etc im just not getting it from the comments i gather many people feel showing the nitty gritty of genocide is going too far i would disagree showing it in a movie however is unforgivable this franchise is not the right platform to be making serious commentary on social issues4 fails to be an entertaining spectacle or a considered exploration of an important issue its just a short utterly meaningless thing with an absolutely absurd final set piece its terrible how a movie about genocide can be so unintentionally funnyhow come everyones head explodes when they get shot why is unintelligible why does he speak in empty platitudes why is the sound so bad on this movie why do missionaries go to help a fully functioning village with a few backpacks of stuff in a war zone how ridiculous can an explosion and the subsequent running away be i love the way kills in so many colourful ways his profession at the start of the movie is awesome as well as his boatman role awesomer and awesomerwatching this movie is a bizarre experience you really walk away going what did i just witness its one of the most unnecessary movies ive ever seen i did laugh quite a bit though so 3 stars seems about right,cruel
it definitely was not in the same level as first blood but at least it was somewhat of an improvement over 3 what about the plot he sly waits all these years turns down good parts and comes up with yet another lets rescue the americans from an asian country they could certainly have thought of some slightly more original or at least not done to death theres really hard to comment on this one on one hand they did well on what they were trying to accomplish which seems to be the clichd story line with awesomely action packed battle scenes on the other hand there is not much else to recommend this flick you were waiting for a repeat of the old stuff then i wouldnt miss it but if you had been hoping for even the smallest improvement then you can wait for dvd or at least the second run theater showing of it,cruel
with this ultraviolent fourth entry in the canon youre in for a small surprise while this is by no means a good movie in itself its still slightly better than expected and better than its two predecessors of course the pretty allamerican girl is not harmed by the evil burmese military while the villagers are slaughtered of course the titular hero saves the day of course its all terribly twofaced and reactionary building up a discrepancy between hollywood action movie tropes and the terror on real killing fields just as it was the case in the earlier installments except for the first part maybe but in times of bland and forgettable hollywood action entertainment with its pseudoclever lines and outrageous situations this literally visceral downtoearth approach earns some extra points it really gets to you in a smutty kind of way3 out of 10 sonorously mumbled laconic statements,cruel
yes this movie is violent its you expect that but lets try to keep it real i believe the body count in this movie is somewhere in the 230s but the movie itself says theres about 100 bad guys so did we kill them all twice or what yes there are some good guys and innocent bystanders in that count but a long way from 130 of themthe movie apart from body parts flying everywhere isnt too bad but unfortunately the focus does seem to be almost exclusively on blowing people up even when they just get shot there seems to be a blow up effect go figure i agree with one other poster who said that it got to the point it was almost comical because it was so ridiculous,cruel
the story in this fourth movie is glued together as a jungleadventure  rescue mission in which our hero barely gets any real action to deal with in the first act of the movie he feels like the slowest cat in town now he agrees to help a group of christian relief workers into wartorn burma  now drops them off and as soon as they have arrived they get attacked and are taken prisoners gets the news and goes for the rescue  armed with his ridiculously sadexpression on his face now we expect to deliver explosive action and goes heavy on the gore the exploding heads blood squirts and torn limbs will satisfy the audiences blood lust but sadly gets sidelined by this terrible christan group and the even more terrible mercenarysoldiers who helps out killing the badguyssly returned rocky balboa to the big screen with success because it was just as much the story of sly himself taking place an actorboxer who needed one more round in the ring makes sense  and after all rockys a soft character with heart and soul s heart and soul is made rock hes a tough nail and hes a killer  in the best sequence here we see sly acknowledging through a dream sequence where colonel trautman the great richard crenna tells him to stop denying what he truly is but when the movies best scene features looking into the past and showing good ol times giving nostalgia youd rather watch the true 80ties hero in a 80ties movie than watching him out of place in 2008,cruel
why bother sending troops to iraq and afghanistan just send john one guy a pretty old guy some bible bashers and a world gone crazy in burmaanyone know where burma is i bet most of you dont but thats not the point of this filmwell s going there to sort things out help some friends tag along for a ride try out his bow  arrowbible bashers get into some trouble you know the way things go with jehovas witnesses they knock on too many doors try to sell too many stories about doom and damnation and the locals get angryshows up oh so reluctantly cause hes against all that bloodshed business always has been always will bethat about sums it up its been a while since i laughed so hard,cruel
i can remember being a freshfaced nine year old when first blood part 2 came out and at school one of those horrible kids who looked about five years older than what they were said that hed seen it and shoots someone in the face cuts another guys head off etc obviously when i got round to seeing this movie it wasnt as bad as had been described now finally twenty three years later stallone has made the movie that was promised to me back in 85starts off with reallife news footage of atrocities in burma which segues into the actions of the nowfictional burmese army  already stallone has set the tone of the movie and frankly if there were no named actors in this movie you could be forgiven for thinking this was all real footage one thing thats been great about action and horror films for the last five years is the use of grainy film and lack of colour filters  thank you chainsaw massacreplot rundown is pointless as you already know if youre going to want to watch it or not some people have criticized the movie for showing violence against children obviously this will upset some people but as far as the movie goes it was necessary to show the brutality of the soldiers and their actions these things do go on in the real world and by cutting them out you are diluting the impact of the movie its there on the screen and if you dont like it  dont watch it as for the rest theres beheadings people getting cut in half flying limbs disembowelments  and its all shown in full with no cuts or hints of suggestionsall thats left to say is  thank you mrstallone  you redeemed yourself with rocky balboa and you surpassed yourself with youve made this lifelong fan believe again,cruel
i saw yesterdayhere in portugal and its awesome stallone is the man it was so cool to see killing the burnese soldiers with the heavy machine gun i really felt happy to see him do that after they killed the villagers he should make a new trilogy is an iconand will not be forgotten ive cried in the end of the movie after the final war me and my buddieswill go to see this movie 3 more times because it was greatmr stallone pleasedeliver more s like this its the 80s style again i recommend this movie to all people who like 80s movies its the best,cruel
if youre one of those people who felt disappointed by 2 and 3 then have no fears 4 is a whole new breed of beast and what a beast john is on fire in this movie possibly the most graphic action film i have ever seen but done oh so well saving private ryan beach landing scene eat your heart out watch this film and in so doing encourage stallone to keep making movies it is so worth it i thought it couldnt get any better after rocky balboa but it did if i could give this movie 12 stars i would see it what are you still doing reading this i said go see it seriously this isnt even me typing anymore im already off to watch it again,cruel
after seeing last years rocky balboa and now i cant help but conclude that stallone has really poured his heart and soul into these two films  and it shows some people will never like violent action flicks but for those who do is first rate and stays true to itself a man of few words but intense personal conflict stallones is an iconic presence on screen he fears nothing and can do nearly anything still the one thing he lacks and that has driven him to an almost monastic existence is the basic faith that the people from his own country will ever value him or accept him he sees himself as little more than a weapon left behind a relic from a war that had long since faded away like an ancient bomb lying deep within the jungle stallones is a dormant force of boundless fury which like his hope in humanity is slowly fading awaybut there is hope yet for  and for the tsunami of destruction that moviegoers undoubtedly wait to behold a couple of goodnatured but bumbling missionaries enter the fold the smoldering of begins to commence then  bam  nonstop bigblock action euphoria a million bullets and a mountain of bad guys later the movie gracefully draws to a close sure its violence and its definitely not shakespeare but dont dismiss this as a mindless movie like the original first blood theres powerful meaning and metaphor for those keen enough to look and for those who know about the problems in southeast asia the movie draws admirable attention to problems that really do exist lots of violence but far from pointless 810 welcome back sly,cruel
male24detroit mi  i saw the movies growing up and obviously saw john as an iconic figure i recently rewatched the trilogy and obviously was most impressed with the first movie the 2nd and 3rd were pretty cheesy but still great fun to watch because of the mindless violence and action thats i went into this movie expecting nothing less than what i got a ton of blood violence and good ol kickin some foreign wrongdoers asses the beginning of the movie actually gives us a peak into the real travesties occurring in burma but after that its straight fiction at its best i also loved all the new ways you see people getting killed in this movie i think i muttered holy st about 15 different times if the theater had been at least half full i know we wouldve heard some cheers rather than the occasional ooh and aahsi really enjoyed the flashbacks to the old movies although i did think they were a bit oddlytimed and not used enough i think s past shouldve been utilized much more other than that the consistent action and notsobad storyline minus the religious group being total idiots made this movie very enjoyable to watchfor those who love relentless violence and action which is the essence of the flicks aside from the first i suppose you will absolutely love this movie for those expecting anything else go see  1 meet the spartans which doesnt deserve to grace the big screen alongside ,cruel
there will never be another first blood but this was good there was a ton of violence there was some skip frame photography as a nod to the director of alien but that was ok there was this really mean burmese general that constantly smoked as he would watch his soldiers kill their own people there are not too many places as violent as burma thank goodness was there with his bow and arrow one of the best scenes was when that guy kept taunting on the boat and calling him boatman i was surprised he didnt try to throw him over the edge right there and theni give this a thumbs up as i was in the theater everybody kept laughing because the movie was so over the top with violence,cruel
first blood is one of the best action movies of all time if you think it was too violent and brutal then you should think once again because the latest would blow your mind the direction is amazing frankly did not expect any action in this 60 old actors movie the direction is first class stallone has actually established the villain to be very violent brutal commander that we actually wish every second that he should be killed as brutally as possible the action scenes were so brutal that there were lot of aaarghh in the theater the way the bullets drive through the bodies in the climax was pretty gore in the end very well directed movie with lots of bullets flying around i wish to narrate some scenes here but they have to be watched on screen to get the feel must watch for every one who are strong at heart no prior first blood experience required,cruel

is incredible easily the best action movie of all time stallone is also one of the best actorwriterdirectors of all time too because his films are entertaining last decembers rocky balboa is one of my favorite films is now one of my favorites too this movie has nonstop action and will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time people need to understand there is violence in war there is also a great message behind this film too i also liked the using of the real life situation in burma and plugging into that situation much like rocky was plugged in to the real world of boxing in rocky balboa this film also puts a great ending to the saga the movies are the best action films and is easily the best one i give this movie 10 stars and two thumbs way way up go see this film then go see it again,cruel
forget all the negativity if you happen to be on yahoo movies just believe what the users say and not those critics who are so negative about this film are blatantly being dishonest ppl were clapping at the end of the film i wont reveal much but in short all i can say is this final is the best of the series its got perfect story perfect casts excellent action very very ish superb ending to those of you who seen it you know what i am talking about its not all about mindless action this movie has got every aspect that you would want in a film heart and soul with that i say a full 5 stars to to those whod think there would be a 5th go watch the film and judge for yourself if you would want a sequel from my side i think the 4th had properly wrapped the entire series,cruel
we just saw iv it was terrific now when i say that it does not mean that the plot or acting was any good like all movies they were nonsense just made up to show the heros skills against a better armed and much larger enemy this time the bad guys are the burmese and they are really horrid in this film they are guilty of rape murder torture buggery and everything evil that you can think ofincluding feeding live hostages to the pigs to eat not a very nice crowdis himself and i understood about half of what he mumbled now here it the big disclaimerdo not see this movie if you have suffered shell shock combat fatigue or ptsd this is by far the most violent movie yet made once the fighting starts there are no holds barred we have people blown in half decapitated or losing limbs from being hit by a 50 caliber rifle we have dozens of heads and arms chopped off by machetes or blown off by mines and mortars this movie is a blood bathof course they made the burmese such villains that most of the moviegoers were cheering and oohing and aahing every time a head exploded you could hear people shouting get that bastard as a burmese officer tried to flee the carnage he was gutted but they were classy enough not to show intestines falling outso if you want to see a war movie so over the top that it is almost a comedy and the audience is laughing as the arms and legs fly through the air this is your movie if you have any sensitivity to death and violence stay home,cruel
rubbish yet another sequel by the king of sequels that takes place some 20 years after the last sequeliii of this franchise in this sequel comes out yet again to help a group of do gooders find some prisoners that are being held in a thirdworld hellhole violence more violence and extremely graphic gore in a film that is so devoid of any substance it is pathetic films like this sequel and last years miserable rocky balboa sequelyou knew i was going to use this word again show how far or rather how little stallone has come as an actor over the last 30 years lets face it people this guy is just a two character actor this really is an august movie that was released in january these months are dumping times when hollywood releases its worst of the worst amazing thing is that this seqer film was shown to critics so there you have it if you saw 1 2 or 3 you already saw  beyond bad this film is insulting to anyone with an iq of over 20 thank me i just saved you 8 bucks truly bottom of the barrel swill there is absolutely no reason for you to see this moviefilms like thisand rocky balboa give sequels their bad name stay away zero stars,cruel
i havent seen 3 in a while so i cant be entirely sure if this is the film with the least amount of plot takes a couple of missionaries into burma they get abducted he gets em back that is really all thats happening its not that i expected a classical drama but this one was supposed to bring the series back to its rootsalso aside from porn ive possible never seen a flick with that little dialog which is probably a good thing since all characters are cartoonishly stereotypedthe only thing this movie has that stands out are shockingly realistic splatter scenes the fighting itself is bullsht as always with sporting the usual superhuman abilities but anytime some projectile hits a body oh my it brings a level of realism to this clownfest of movie that feels totally inappropriate as does the spraytan war weariness of the protagonist looking unhappy while killing the sht out of burma and showing lots of cruelty against women and children doesnt make a drama neither does all the effort from the special effects department unless youre of minor age than youll probably be so geared up by all the bleeding youll consider this a masterpiecelastly the message of the film is essentially humanitarians are idiot dreamers if you really want to change the world you simply have to kill all the evil people questionable to say the least,cruel
i thought first blood was a bit dark stallones acting was just superb in that one the rest were just typical 80s clowns in that movieafter that the 2nd and 3rd were just dull and mainstream just followed the trend of missing in action aside chuck norris with pow and stuff there were few more others besides conan the barbarian commando made its mark thanks to these 1 man war movies really made arnold famous for us asians we were war movie addicts back thenok about this one i think this is what stallone and the writer had in mind all along this was one is the best yet with so much pure and simple gore in it almost like a slasher movie so much blood the story line revealed what is all about rather than who he is to make it simple is like the modern day saint but hes got some serious weapons with himif youre looking for build ups and endings forget it you watch this to let go of your anger and hatred towards some really bad personnel and unfortunately the asians were the culprits againdont miss this one action and gore is written all over it like i said its the best yet,cruel
that is all you need to hear if you love like me you will love this movie you get to see rip a guys throat out with his bare hand stabbed a dude in the stomach and take out his intestines jump on the back of a 50 cal mounted machine gun and turn people into mince meat cut a dudes head off say some itty gritty philosophy stuff about killing when you are pushed and seeing attach a mine to a mini bomb and having it explode destroying an entire foresthighlights of this movie are killing some pirates saying live for nothing or die for something ripping a guys neck out on the 50 cal cutting a guys head off making a machete that he will eventually use to kill and the final shot of on american soil again1010,cruel
the story doesnt make sense if the christian dogooders have been to burma before why on this occasion do they need and s blasting truck loads of burmese soldiers but these boys were kidnapped from villages and made into soldiers so needs lessons in compassion but this movies a shoot em up so needs lots of so called baddies to blow holes in and another stupid thing the rebels helping at the end cheesy apart from that s a decent refreshingly hardcore kickarse action flick and at times genuinely moving go ,cruel
leads a group of mercenaries into burma to rescue some christian missionaries in this fourth movie in the series released twenty years after the last one sylvester stallone not only stars but also writes and directs this one it doesnt feel like any of the previous movies gone are any remnants of the 80s that being said at least seems more in character than he did in iii this is a grittier movie than the others with more violent and gruesome action scenes the climactic battle is about as over the top as it gets if youre not a big fan of movies where theres an excessive amount of loud gunfire this is not the movie for you the supporting cast in this one is fine pretty julie benz is probably the only one youre likely to really care about sadly theres no colonel trautman as richard crenna had died by the time this was made not sure how he would have fit into this story anyway but perhaps the end scene could have been reworked to include him anyway its a dark and violent movie but a good one not on the level of first blood or as much fun as part ii but definitely better than part iii whether this is the last time we see remains to be seen but if this is the final one its a fitting end to s story,cruel
john is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat when a group of christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in burma to help the locals only accepts when sarah miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission leaves the group in the requested location but the village where they are working is attacked by a sadistic army the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted later a member of their church meets and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionariesfive years agoit was great to see back on the big screen willis had returned to his die hard roots just six months previous and good old fashioned action was sorely missednow take away all the nostalgia of the eighties action movies and the diminished expectations many of the public had with action movies and what you get is a very average very formulaic moviedont get me wrong when i first saw this i thought it was amazing but when i watch it now i couldnt care less what happens in the film until starts his slaughter because to he honest thats all we have paid to seethe rest of the film is brit actors pretending to be very tough and giving them dirty looks missionaries trying to reason with and he just swearing at them and walking offand dreaming about the alternate ending to first bloodstallone is as good as ever and the film really does come alive in the last half hour but the first hour really drags and in hindsight its not very good at all,cruel
i was shocked when i opened the top 250 list there i saw dark knight at number threebut what did that movie have lousy action scenes christian bale growling its nothing more than a passable action movie hyped up by heath ledgers passingbut it deserves to be on that slot here you have a resurfaced 60year old action hero extremegore mutilation dismemberment disembowelment mass child killing rape firepower explosions and much more brutal violence that culminates into one of the most violent endings for an action movie puts all the other top 250 movies to shamein the movietries to live a solitary lifeagain but the guy just camt violence follows him where ever he goes but instead of backing down ranbo confronts it with heavy artillery with gory results this film pulls no punches in terms of violence and i think that led me to say that it belongs to the best of the bestumlike killing fieldsor platoon stallone shocks us with images from hell and he resolves them with brutal efficiencybe reminded however that this is not saving private ryandespite comparisons to the camera work and violencethis has more violence than saving private ryan and has more heartoverallthis is one instant classic its a moviesplatter filmshockumentary just dont give me part 5 hes too old for that,cruel
ok this is a great movie period however it felt like iii all over again only with some famous syvelster stallone quotes chucked in and with a lot more gore and bloodthis movie isnt really disturbing like what people make it out to be sure little babies are killed and stamped on but its only fake in the movies its real in real life which brings me onto something else this movie was made for a reason to have an impact on the way people feel about those mad heads who invaded burma and killed millions of people unlike iii which was just to bring back the action herobut dont get me wrong here i found 3 somewhat more entertaining so may i please ask why 4 has a better rating than 2  3still there are two reasons for this film to exist and 1 is very good1 to bring back 2 to have an impact in burma,cruel
the last time i watched a new movie i was a kid as an adult watching this i felt i was watching a documentary more than anything sylvester stallone deserves accolades awards and honors on so many levels for this movie this was an exceptional movie i like the character however while i was watching it the story its self kept me in the movie and not the hero john i felt i was right there living and dieing in every scene i hope this cleans up during award time because while it is billed as an action movie it has a more powerful message about the suffering of an oppressed people thanks mr stallone for enlightening me for a brief moment,cruel
the fourth installment in the series is awesome its got cussing smoking explosions guns blood death destruction and everything else a good action movie should have its the best movie yet its the goriest by far and it definitely has the best storyline plus it depicts a realistic view of true total war iv does not hold back if you dont like to see asians throwing children into pits of fire then iv is not for youlets see what else does this awesome movie have well its got stallones best acting since rocky and he probably doesnt even utter 500 words throughout the whole 91 minutes also did i mention it has violence in one scene john rips out the throat of an asian guy pretty sweetso yeah rules this may be the best action film of the decade and i dont say stuff like this lightly after the rather ridiculous first blood ii and iii its good to see that people are still capable of making classic action films,cruel
pulling a has been used thousands of times to describe extreme and out of control behavior like its namesake celluloid character it was meant not in a serious way but as an over the top clich this movie changes that and does so it a big way the fact that stallone is past 60 and has made the definitive movie is even more remarkablethe movie starts by depicting military death squads in burma senselessly killing their fellow men women and children right off you know the scope of the movie is much more than about john s problems with a realistic story about modern day genocide s character is no longer reduced to video game parody the story provides a very realistic way to show his attributes as redeeming instead of troubled and crazy he becomes a true heroi did not expect this movie to break new ground in effects yet it does it is quite possibly the most realistic depiction of violent death by large caliber gunfire ever committed to film it serves the story and isnt gratuitous further giving credence to s new status in the seventies there was walter hills long riders the nineties gave us spielbergs saving private ryan and now there is i never thought id say a stallone film would add to that distinguished cannon of work for some i have no doubts its too graphic but it honestly shows the brutality of war without pulling punchesim going to applaud sylvester stallone in 2006 he made a real comeback with rocky balboa it restored that character in an amazing way now in 2008 is more than restored hes reinvented in a totally compelling wayno longer a campy clich hes an american icon,cruel
i gotta say two minutes after the movie has ended i found myself still sitting in the cinema all alone except for two of my friends totally speechless and if youre just like me who prefer the old time action movies which lasted for 2hours with nothing but blood guns and a smalltime story nothing fancy but its just there to hold the movie together then this is the perfect flick for you my friendthis movie got the most gruesome action sequence ive ever seen and on top of that sly probably did his best performance as an actor tooohh and btw kind of a spoiler inc at the end when all the bad guys are dead and sly is standing on top of the hill with the fantastic epic music in the background if you ask me that scene itself should win an academy award3 weeks ago i thought die hard 4 was a mind blower and one of the coolest movies ever but is so much better its embarrassing 10 out of 10 no doubt about that but then again it might just be me who feel this way,cruel
according to the wisdom of john when youre pushed killing is as easy as breathing now one may doubt that statement as breathing is pretty easy but in a glorious orgy of violence proves his statement to be true killing is a piece of cakethe volume of slayings in is well documented but nothing quite prepared me for it hundreds of people are shot beheaded roasted stabbed and blown up its probably the most relentlessly violent film ive ever seen needless to say i enjoyed ita lotthere was one point in the film where i just couldnt help but laugh in the final massacre theres a bit where a bad guy gets shot in the head and his head explodes in a cloud of blood i have no idea whether stallone thinks hes making a political statement in this film or a comment on the nature of evil in the modern world but i find his fidelity to stomachchurning carnage quite charming honestly hes not trying to win hearts and minds with words and bs hes winning hearts and minds by vanquishing evildoers by vaporising themhowever there are people who think differently people who think they can change the world with love and compassion what fools and no sooner have the christian human rights missionaries in this film begun treating burmas sick and begun telling them about jesus than the burmese army is shooting themthe scene where the village is attacked is a perfect example of how excessive this film is men women and children are shot and stabbed and blown up and at one point a child is even tossed into a ball of flame but just when youre staring wideeyed at the screen as a thousand bullets whistle past your ears in beautiful surround sound the symphony of violence is pulled out and mournful ethereal music plays look at the pointless bloodshed look at the anguish of hundreds of peoples heads being popped off their shoulders like fleshy balloons look at the waste isnt it tragic yes yes it is wipes away tear in this film is a shadow of his former mulleted glory no longer does the sight of his oily sweatdrenched torso have straight men questioning their sexuality instead hes become old and weary his headband is less flamboyant and muscle tone has given way to muscle mass but perhaps realising this stallone throws in a brief flashback sequence a la rocky iv to show as he used to be what a man he was how his biceps bulged and how his pecs heaved watching so much man is like remembering a cherished memory  the smile of a loved one now departed the laugh of a child now grown the glow associated with a favourite jazz mag now soiled beyond recognition ah memoriesbut the flashback sequence perhaps has a more serious meaning we see how has suffered over the years how hes been defined by killing but the flashback is also played against the background of a storm yeah thats right a storm is coming a massive slightly flabby monosyllabic john shaped stormthe first example of s skills comes with some rrated robin hoodism a handful of soldiers are despatched with johns bow and arrow but these people arent killed with boring old shots to the chest oh no instead arrows penetrate heads and shoot through faces sweethowever this is only the beginning and a bunch of mercenaries have to enter a wellprotected army camp in order to get to the missionaries they eventually do this but they have the little problem of hundreds of soldiers fortunately though most of them are holding a little rape party so theyre occupied but youve got to admire the rapist soldiers in this film i mean standard ordinary rape is so pass its so brute the characters here realise that the old inout needs a bit of pizazz a bit of glamour so just as things are starting a guy runs in with a red smoke flare yeah thats the stuff thats the kind of thing that makes a rape party go with a bang  lots of groovy red smokebut speaking of rape how come the cute blonde missionary gets away unscathed i mean okay we see hundreds of people shot and blown up we see a crucified missionary have his fleshy leg stumps get eaten by ravenous pigs we see burmese soldiers make villagers run through mineridden swamps for a laugh we see children get shot and tossed into flames we see burmese women raped but somehow the sight of a cute white woman getting raped by dastardly brown folks is too much we cant see that that would be too disturbingbut would rape really be that bad in the grand scheme of things when you have to watch a massacre from close range because thats what happens to the poor woman she has to stand there and watch slaughter what seems like hundreds of soldiers as he fires on them from an armoured jeep heads pop limbs fly and men are pulped but you see while the earlier violence was sickening this violence is gnarly and thats because the burmese soldiers were heartless bastards and is a beautiful vengeful angel of death you see violence is fine when youre righteven one of the missionaries learns this at the beginning hes insistent that violence is never justified but at the end hes smashing a guy to death with a rock i mean being holy is good and all that but its not going to stop you getting abused by nonenglish speaking brown folks is it whereas a rock will righteous hearty violence solves everything,cruel

we have recently had tv footage of burmese monks being butchered the new film where sylvester stallone assumes control of a band of mercenaries to rescue a group of christian missionaries there has been banned in burma and criticised by some human rights workers an australian democracy group accuses it of muddying the water of peaceful resistance true aung san suu kyis the deposed democratic opponent to the brutal military regime has advocated peaceful resistance but she is no ghandi fighting a relatively civilised colonial power for sixty years all protest peaceful and otherwise has been ruthlessly crushedit is not surprising that the new film has become a bootleg hit in burma stallone plays the mythical hero warrior no superpowers just a devastatingly efficient and ruthless fighter says stallone i called the united nations i asked them what is the most underreported most graphic and devastating abuse of human rights on the planet and they said burma whether it is a help or a hindrance let the viewer and maybe history be the judge whether stallone should have bothered making yet another movie let the audience alone decide i am not a big fan of this type of movie but for me it did what it said on the tin the character was wellcrafted a believable fighting machine and the battles were unstintingly realistic and violent if we have movies like this and there will perhaps always be a demand then is it better to glorify police vs gang brutality vigilanteism controversial wars or fights against supremely corrupt and reallife regimes uses burmesethai actors and crew including real refugee rebels amputees land mine victims and former burmese soldiers the filming is done in and around chiang mai northern thailand in a setting that closely mimics the area on both sides of thaiburmese border surprisingly many of the refugees already knew of as a hero character before casting began when half a century of peaceful protest fails after the collapse of british colonialism at the end of wwii people need heroes to give them hope and a reason to carry on even if the hope never materialisesworks the river catching and selling deadly snakes to a hospital a christian missionary group wants to hire his boat to get into burma hand out medicines and deliver religious tracts the vietnam veteran is reluctantly convinced when they dont return a second pastor hires a group of mercenaries to retrieve them and again presses s boat into service but this time insists on tagging along the guntoting crew are unfamiliar with the terrain and the army they are up against their lack of any higher purpose beyond getting paid saps their cohesion proves his prowess not only in combat but morally and as a leader it is not heavy intellectual stuff i did not find it ethically abhorrent one doesnt go to see and not expect violence i was worried that it would maybe promote some pieinthesky christianitysaves agenda but it was silent on the missionaries position except in using them as a plot device their actions ultimately and pointedly resulted in great loss of life but on the other hand those of that faith might believe it is worth itthe film is even ambivalent about the violence of its protagonists it is a violent film but s belief is that nothing anyone can do peaceful or nonpeaceful will change anything its main contributions are threefold it is perhaps the best film of the icon it is reasonably good entertainment on its own level but most of all it can help to raise awareness of the systemic rape and torture by the burmese army of its own people and if the burmese gain hope from it it could be the icing on the cake or the safety off the gun,cruel
you think you would know what expect when you would see a sylvester stallone flickdemolition man judge dredd driven tango and cash and lets not forget the bloody awful assassins you would expect silly campy dialog and crazy over the top action sequences at times that could make fall asleep but surprisingly you didnt get that with this movie it really tried to be realistic and not silly or over the top im amazed he was able to get back into the character of john after 20 years away from the character and being in his 60s but i guess its like riding a bicycle john leads a gang of mercenaries to rescue a group of christian aid workers who were taken by a ruthless local infantry unit for viewers if you like a good action war film then this film is for you,cruel
norse sage from akershus norway had this to say i didnt expect it to be any more than a cheesy and somewhat gory tribute to eighties actioners by a stardirectorproducerwriter who was desperate to relive past glory that latter may or may not be true but my former assessment was plain wrong this movie is authentic shocking and unlike any other comparable moviegiven its genre the movie is a masterpiece the story is simple but solid and works on several levels the action scenes are unparalleled more intense than black hawk down saving private ryan and stalingrad put together the level of brutality and gore will shock and fascinate and no doubt cause some level of controversystallone proves himself to be an excellent director as well as in excellent shape for his age i had little faith in him going in and i stand correctedthis is a who has come to terms with who and what he is in a movie that holds up when compared with the original first blood well done sly well done indeeddittodittoditto,cruel
just seen this movie and like very much to comment on it it is a great action movie which i will see more and more i am very happy for stallone could come back and prove his talent as a great director too the film is very fast but i would have liked it to be longer i wanted more of killing bad peoplethe war shots are very well done after rocky balboa stallone returns with a better gem of action i am waiting for more stallone films as a star and a director too for all action and war movie fans go and see ityou will like it very much i now would like to see the previous films that i saw and enjoyed long agoof course i will add this movie to my action collection,cruel
normally i prefer romantic road movie but i found with john some things interesting about live and love the movie still very violent but thats the goal of this movieit present the bullet impacts on the body as the reality it present how kind of commander exist inside the camps and it present which mind have some peace workers inside deep forest and hostile territories john still play the hostile man against all forms of trial from usa and he may realize somethings new inside his home place and he still has some interrogation about the new style lifei said i burn to kill but think to kill and want think another tripthats a very nice movie,cruel
1st off ive never seen a film i tried watching the 1st one and just laughed all the way thru iti got to the part where hes riding around on a motorbike getting chased then turned it off  wot a load of crap that was this one on the other hand tho i have to say well done mr director whoever u are this film is the bks the violence was just mentalthe acting was goodi fort that bloke who kept mugging stallone off on the boat was gonna get a slap but then he turned out to be alrite and made me laugh a couple times all in all this film was really good and i recommend it 100 and to the idiots who didnt like this film u muste have ran out of weed or boozelaterz ppl,cruel
hell yeah this is probably the single best action movie of the 21st century believe you me a straightforward plot some awesome music and off we go the absolutely killer action scenes complete with stallones trademark man im about to go berzerk grin and the sheer intensity of the whole thing makes you want to jump off your seat paint your face with em junglecommando war paints and head off to some godforsaken war zone to squash evil off the face of the planet they havent dared to make an action movie so intense and downrightaction for the past 10 years you seenowadays every action flick has a minimum of 45 minutes of some lets get every mother and grandma in the country to watch this moral justification not that theres anything wrong with that it just doesnt fit into a quality action movie if i want to hear about such things ill watch the popes speech not some goofy  2 love drama political correctness etcbut this crushes all that straight to hell like a good action movie should you can take the guy away from a war but you cant take war away from the guy the best movie of the lot so go see it now well go on then,cruel
if you liked any of the other movies im sure you will like this one two not for the faint of heart or those on the far left fringes the film earned its r rating lots of violence so i wouldnt take young kids although most stalone movies dont have much story or plot this one actually had some things to think about if you paid attention i really likes the lead actresss role in the movie as a missionary trying to make the world a better place save souls help people and make a difference i think she really succeeded in her goal although not in the way she intended in the move we see that john is more than just a killing machine or someone not interested in being saved too there is some redemption for us all in the end,cruel
you dont go into a movie expecting great acting and a believable plot  you expect an impossible mission and a bulldozer running over it and thats what we got  an action packed film  very entertaining  with a little pointer to burmas tragedy  to be honest after i watcher rocky i didnt expect sly to do that well on  and at the little time at the movies beginning that prepared for the action i thought i was right  but damn was i wrong  when the action starts theres no stopping it again i was suspicious of stallone directing  but again great job sylvester the plot was old time  you feel like watching a movie from the 80s but with todays gadgets  very little cheesy acting but again when i watch im not expecting great acting as much as a roller coaster ride from hell and that mrsylvester stallone delivered in my honest opinion sylvester stallone should star his directing career on action movies and were expecting a lot finally and again congratulations mrstallone on a great movie,cruel
this movie has it all i was so driven with emotion i was literally shaking and my husband kept trying to get me to move over and release his arm from my death grip you know those regimes are out there but this really drives it home the people who think they can make adifference and those who sometimes have to go in risk their own livesto save them you can see different view pointsdifferent reasonsthe goodthe badthe despicable when the film was over the four of us in attendance all sat in our chairs for a moment and just saidwowwas that great or what we will be buying that when it comes out on cd for sure way to go sly,cruel
please note that this comment is from someone who hasnt seen the classics yeah im deprived i knowthe movie was generally satisfying the plot wasnt very sophisticated but pft its excellent action cinematography yadda yadda stallone does his jobthe stoicness of the character was believable and effective in driving the story my only major complaint is that there wasnt a high enough revenge to rape ratio if youre going to put something as powerful as rape into a movie then you need to step up the retribution factor there could have definitely been more hand to hand combat for example said hand to hand could have fleshed out the 93 minute runtime and added more satisfaction in the end,cruel
all in all this has been one of the few action movies to entertain me for a while other than hitman i was kind of meeeh with die hard 4 terminator 3 and the like but they lacked something that i thought iv brought to the table this is one of those films i wouldnt change any elements at all but this only from my opinion just go see it and judge for yourself i cant say that you will or wont be disappointed everyone has there own taste of whats good and whats not all i know is what was presented to me i and what i took from it for me it showed that no matter how much we want to live a peaceful world where we can all sit down and talk out our problems we simply cant some people dont want to talk they want to fight and control others and thats where the film is getting at the scary thing is that there are no movie monsters that are more scary than the brutal killers that are portrayed in this film these people that are the reasons why our nations have soldiers in the first place the film also points out that there comes to a point where you keep getting pushed you have to push back or things will not stop it certainly does not say go kill someone because youre being bullied but in certain situations people cant sit by and let things go the way they are as quote goes all it takes for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothingand thats where the film leaves us do we sit or fight back kill or be killed will i be evilgood for fighting back such is the conundrum that is presented and struggle that we could all someday face,cruel
after i was disappointed by bocky balboa i feared for the worst with i thought it would be slow like rocky 6 but i was wrong it is not slow at all very fast im forgiving some of the mild dialogue and how quickely the christians change s mind i also think stallone deserves mucho credit for shining light on this situation in the world i was not aware of the horrors taking place in burma we are very fortunate to live in the usa where we dont have to see children speared and there parents shot or tortured as a regular accurance it is very sad to see that this kind of thing is more common than the freedom of america thank you sylvester stallone,cruel
make no mistake about it this film is an unadulterated unapologetic balls out action film there is carnage there is blood there is more carnage the film takes enough time to reintroduce us to john j who now is absolutely disenfranchised with life not his country but just life in generalwe see that is now capturing snakes and basically tending to the bare necessities of life a mission group comes through needing a guide to get them through the waters in bhurma at first doesnt want to have anything to do with them but a woman in the group who is equally committed spiritually as is disenfranchised convinces him to take them down river when said missionary is captured some mercs are brought in and is asked to take them in what ensues is having to recognize who he is and accept that he is a war machine that has one last fight in himthis film separates itself from the two sequels and hones into what made the first film great the one thing different is the absolute noholds bared manner in which the violence is depicted we do not get cutaway shots we see full on the devastation that violence causesin the end is able to excise some personal demons and heads home in a literal and mental senseas with rocky stallone has given his other alternate ego a send off that is fitting,cruel
twenty years have passed since sylvester stallone last portrayed exgreen beret john in that lackluster installment the weakest of the series imho he fought the red army in afghanistan this time around its the turn of the burmese army a very safe choice of opponent for our hero given the current political climate to eat the whoopass and return for secondsthe plot is very basic is living in thailand and agrees to ferry a group of annoying american missionaries into the wilds of burma the film does not call it myanmar so that they can minister to the karen tribe who are being persecuted by the burmese military when this task is accomplished it looks like he can get back to his current pastimes of swordsmelting trapping cobras and spouting bits of sophomoric philosophy example you cannot change what is needless to say it doesnt turn out like that the missionaries are taken prisoner by the brutal burmese military and ends up leading a group of mercenaries who have been hired to rescue themwhat else is there to say well quite a few things actually first of all the plentiful action scenes are amazingly welldone stallone directed this effort himself and has done an outstanding job of depicting the highvelocity carnage that occupies all of the films second half this film is worth seeing on a big screen for the battle scenes alone without a doubt this is the most violent of the series at times the screen positively drips with bloodalso even at the age of 61 stallone can still play the title character convincingly put simply he looks like he was carved out of a particularly massive block of granite though says little stallone does imbue him with a genuine humanity in this case centering on his understanding that he is unable to see the point of life without warthe supporting cast are also agreeable notably julie benz as the missionary who convinces a disinterested that her colleagues expedition has a purpose and matthew marsden as a likable english sniper to wrap up never tries to be anything other than what it looks a highoctane jungle bloodbath if you are a fan of the previous installments dont wait for the dvd see this yesterday,cruel
after seeing so many bad reviews by critics i thought what the heck why everyone is so interested about dissecting a movie which is completely unpretentious and unapologetic about what it is all aboutthis is at best there is little story almost no gimmicks and a lots of gore and violence all delivered in the old style if you are a fan old school action movies then festival season started very early if you are not then why you came to the theater for a movie and did i mention the villain this is devil reincarnation and as there is little explanation or motive given it makes the villain even more loathsome so when our john j kicks butt we cheerthis is pure poetic action and carnage at best even the carnage in saving private ryan or all the haloween friday 13th movies combined together doesnt come closed to what deliversthe only complain is they should have padded up the length a bit to add some more of that violencemy vote 910,cruel
i knew the second i saw the previews for this movie that i was going to see it ive always been a big fan because of things he stands for and his passion for what he believes i was not disappointedi was hooked from the moment it started the action was amazing and realistic and the story was great say what you will about stallone being too old i dont care he certainly didnt look or act it he was in amazing shape and to me the stunts were even better this time i almost want to go see it again before it leaves the bigscreen it really was the perfect end to the series just as rocky balboa was to that series he finally comes full circle i loved it excellent excellent movie,cruel
cinematography is improved lots of handycam shots to give a nervous feel to some scenes shot in a journalistic style sometimes combat scenes have the same realism as seen in saving private ryanis on steroids and he is at his strongest ever difficult to believe that he is 62 rarely speaks therefore no trite lines spokeni felt stronger as i left the movie house the audience gave applause and the male audience took the violence seriously we were fascinated by some of the killing scenesno sex in the movie but some insinuation of rapeno reference to vietnam that war is behind us yea we are in burmahard to believe that this will be the last it is the best movie everthe story is simple a rescue mission we can concentrate on the violence and action which there is muchyoull feel pumped and stronger when you leave the movie house,cruel
i like a lot of folks out there went to see this movie with the feeling that this was going to be cheesy and too nostalgic boy was i wrong as you read these comments you can see that most people who viewed this movie agree it has a great meaning to what really happens in third world countries and to that a lot of us in this country dont condone violence this movie shows that when a hand is around your throat you may have to push back with equal or more forcesad but true the acting was very good on all levels and of course the future implications will arise when some ignorant parent takes their 10 year old kid to see it not realizing the r yep r rating is there for a reason then goes and complains of the brutal but darn near realistic battle scenes sly has been sort of picked on by the uptight crowd who believe that i have nothing against this actor will farrell is one of the best actors of all time but sly can act in this movie you can really see this if you are looking for a film to sit back and relax to this is not the film for you if you are there to see a pulse driven steroid shot to the cerebral cortex a kick to the midregion a nuclear blast to all senses this is the film that you would want to see hold tight it puts you right there with the action,cruel
sylvester stallone takes us back in time as he did with rocky balboa gives us exactly want  an old school wartsandall action flick complete with explosions blood goreand more gore but the film isnt simply an empty vessel its no masterpiece by any means but its very competent yet simple story complete with the dilemma of faith and ethics  and its the return of one of the most iconic characters of the eightiesis by far the most brutal and violent of the films depicting the human race at its worse and most brutal a bold move by writer director and star stallone as this film is not for the fainthearted it can be tough to watch but thats what war is it isnt glamorized like hollywood or the two previous sequels in the series but taken back to first blood a more human story when pushed killing is as easy as breathing and with that john paints our screens red one more time handing out his own brand of justice to a brutal regime and a very real enemy,cruel
alright let me start off as adding to other comments that it is not a good date movie as unless she is into extreme violence be prepared to leave early with her or get yelled at later okay this is a great action movie not much of a story line kind of like a good porno do we really care about the story line hell now get to the action so here it is the whole plot okay do not go to burma no our church group can help no you cannot all they do is get taken after takes them to the village well close to the village he rescues them with an elite groups of mercenaries that is your story and a hell of a lot of blood and guts many damn that was a jacked up explosions will be said as well as a few laughs along the way will i buy it on dvd yes but only high def as the action is sweet,cruel
i havent seen mr stallone for couple of years now and he is back with lots of stamina to perform in this action packed moviei must admit that this movie is really good for action and no long winded conversation and basically all of the plots involving rescue operationwhy not casting two to three well known actor or actress and i believe it can give this film a high boost maybe because of the dust and dirt and mud all are dirty and that is why nobody want to perform in even though the story can bring us back to the 80s but the atmosphere inside has some minor flaw such as stallone did not smile at all he he,cruel
i have to admit i had a bias when i walked in to see 4 i wanted to like it even if i had to make myselflets be honest movies have been considered schlock since the 80s with the exception of first blood they have always been considered mega cheese my generation the ones who were teenagers when first appeared made an icon and even watched his cartoonswith a packed audience of thirty somethings me and my friend took our seats the overall audience attitude was quickly summed up with the deep guttural laughs that came when mumbled f the world most everyone there seemed to think they were the guttural laughs were a bit annoying when the the films full carnage splattered on the screenwhen 4 first starts you are hit with grizzly news images of conditions in burma showing real headless bodies and torture so right off you know this will be different the franchise matured with its audience for better or for worse then in red the title hits the screen saying with out words evil is a crap burger and is hungrybefore seeing 4 i had read a review online the critic stated how he was bored with the antiwar christian rhetoric he even gave the film 2 separate ratings a 4 out of 10 for the first half a 95 out of 10 for the second half so i walked in expecting to be bored a bit while they do that weird thing called character development in the end i dont think that critic could have been more wrong 4 is a very tight film the development is quick and does what he does best before things get boring i was never bored in 4in fact during the last battle scene when the testosterone cup runeth over i thought to myself this has to been the final battle i dont know where this movie could go from here because that last battle was so intense but i had questioned if it were the finale because it had come so quickly even though there were small parts of goodness through out the movie seemed more like an episode rather than a movie only because of the length not because of the developmentbut when all was said and done i left satisfied not full if i had left full i may not have hoped as i do for a 5 i know that stallone has been signed for a 5th but he said well seeone thing that struck me about stallones performance is that he played his age i didnt feel he was trying to recapture his youth or grasp at relevance he played and wrote in a way that seemed natural for the character stallones directing and acting chops shined bright as he conveyed s thoughts without dialog in some instances especially after the last battle through stallones acting and camera work you can almost hear ask himself is this all there isthere are cases when the question is asked should we involve ourselves in foreign affairs in the instance of genocide stallone even taps around the speculation of what is the christian thing to do except in one instance he never tries to answer those questions during the final battle we find one christian character sway from his own rhetoric when his own life is on the line that may have been a weakness in the story because in that instance you might feel stallone had sought to answer one question while spending most of the movie avoiding the answers because lets face it the answers are rarely as simple as black and white but in my opinion that would be the only fault in the story even though it is consistent with the schlock genrei have to also give props to stallone for only giving what was needed to move the story along some writers like to dwell stallone stays focused on the fact that this is a movie we dont want a talking points memo we want kicking butt he even had the decency to minimize nudity during the rape scenes and instead opted to imply the action rather than to indulge and show itthis is by far the goriest of all the movies one i am not sure any tween should see i am not sure i can fault stallone for that either his audience grew up most movies today make the original movies seem tame by violent comparison i am not sure that stallone was trying to one up any of todays violent movies but it did seem appropriate in this context4 is a dirty gritty feeling movie he never seems to glamorize the situation he uses as a tool to convey what we want to do about the violence in our world destroy it so in the end the soldiers that he kills in this movie arent people but represent the face of violence we wish we could eradicate from our world becomes the cleanseri may be over analyzing the movie it is after all but after s look at battles end given where he ends up at the films conclusion i am lead to believe this is what stallone was trying to convey4 is a fantastic finale to the adventures of john all the best elements of are there with maybe a slice less cheese even though i hope there is a 5th 4 is the best swansong to be playedall sons of will love 4,cruel
i was pleasantly surprised by i came to the theaters just expecting nothing but the worst  a self aggrandizing clunker of an action flick from a hasbeen whos squeezing the last drop of marrow from another onceprofitable franchiseinsead what i got was a hammy straightahead guns n guts romp that delivered the goods as advertised giving hell to bad guyswhats entertaining about is its straight ahead 80sstyle approach to the action genre its setup and delivery without a drop of irony or posturing this flick could very well have come out of 1989 except theres a few moments of deadpan gore that probably wouldt have made the cut 20 years ago whats also nice is s work with the band of mercenaries that goes along on the rescue mission it actually felt naturalwhen the credits rolled the theater blew up in applause it was good stupid highfive fun like we all expected  rolled into an efficientlypaced package that never dragged its feet or wore out its welcome,cruel
stallone both starred in and directed this latest entry in the series of films this time the film takes place in the hostile southeast asian country of burma or myanmar as it is also called here escorts a group of missionaries to provide aid for victims of the burmese armys genocide naturally the missionaries are captured and must return this time with a group of mercenaries as expected quite a few intense action scenes occur the action is well done and features a body count rivaling the 80s flicks the only major fault lies in the overuse of insane cgi blood effects though there seems to be a few squibs here and there not to mention some good special makeup effects granted many of the over the top effects could not have been achieved without cgi but i still would have preferred it had traditional means been used i could have gone without the horribly melodramatic music during a massacre scene that takes place yet the sound effects are all top notch and at times reach volumes akin to a metal concert acting is generally pretty bad and stallone is actually one of the better performers along with a crazy british mercenary stallone is still in top physical shape at 61 years old and appears nothing like a john wayne brannigan or mcq despite its faults is a very entertaining action film which at the same time makes one wonder about the horrific situation in burma,cruel
for an action flick its a pretty good movie for a fan it is just plain awesome the violence is not as bad as the reviews make it out to be let me tell you something else there isnt one bad guy that didnt get what was coming to him nuff saidstallone has gotten a lot of experience through the years about how to create a great action sequence and you can tell by the way everything is directed i also think this film is much more believable than the previous two the whole thing in iii with him being on a horse and being missed by a gatling gun in a chopper just wasnt working with me the 80s are back and better than ever see the new die hard rocky balboa and coming soon indiana jones,cruel
this beforeitwascool belated sequel attempts to return back to its series roots but stumbles primarily because its message amounts to little more than burmese soldiers bad and because it has a bodycount that much more closely resembles the almost comical levels of carnage found in iii 1988 than the single infinitely more impactful death found in first blood 1982 2008 is absolutely desperate to come across as gritty and as such it often ends up as an unenjoyable affair that looks pretty much as bad as it feels however there are moments where the chaos comes across as chunkier somewhat more considered and slightly more entertaining or at least engaging 610,cruel

it is quite rare thesedays for a sequel to be this great even better than the predeccesors the only issue i have is that stallone doesnt look as appealing as in the previous movies but what the heck he has aged and time spares no oneit is a worth to watch movie go see it ,cruel

why did it take twenty years to make another movie stallone claims that it was due to a lack of a compelling story an early idea had traveling to mexico to rescue a young girl but it lacked the essence of a lost man wandering and trying to find himselfthere was also a thought that should be living a quiet life with his wife and child when white supremacists kidnap his family another idea saw trying to stop a hostage situation at the united nations  where he is strangely working as a diplomat  and battling terrorists including his adopted son who ill assume is hamid from iiispeaking of the united nations thats where stallone got the idea to set the film in burma in fact lead villain maung maung khin is a former karen freedom fighter who accepted the role to bring awareness of the saffron revolution to the worldthe film is banned by the burmese government it is however available there in bootleg versions thanks to the opposition youth group generation wave the karen national liberation army has publically stated that the movie gave them a morale boost and have adopted the love for nothing or die for something line as a rallying cry that to me said sylvester stallone is one of the proudest moments ive ever had in filmwhen the films original director left stallone stepped in he had no vision for the film until he realized what if the film was directed by he had another big idea that totally amped up the film too realizing that the film had a low budget and that gore is cheap he decided to go all inim here to tell you that this movie is 100 all inthe ruthless major pa tee tint leads an army of men who systematically destroy small villages killing innocents drafting teenagers and abducting and assaulting the women a missionary named michael burnett hires  who makes his living as a snake catcher and boat pilot in thailand  to use his boat on a humanitarian mission to provide medical aidpirates stop the boat and is forced to kill them to save sarah miller pittsburghs own julie benz the only woman in the group everyone is so upset by how violent is that they send him away within hours theyre attacked by tints soldiersof note benz began working for the us campaign for burma after this movie was released saying i cant continue my life without trying to help the situationfather arthur marsh ken howard the white shadow the pastor of the missionaries church asks to take five mercenaries upriver on a rescue effort our hero offers further help but their leader refuses luckily for him sticks around as the soldiers quickly outnumber the mercenarieswhat follows is an absolute massacre as graphically dispatches of everyone in his way sometimes with whole groups being wiped out by weapons fire and other times hand to hand if youre squeamish about gore at all you should avoid this film which is packed with graphic displays of death and dismemberment im serious there is an average of 259 killings for every minute of screen time and an overall body count of 466 peopledavid morell the writer of first blood spoke highly of the film im happy to report that overall im pleased the level of violence might not be for everyone but it has a serious intent this is the first time that the tone of my novel first blood has been used in any of the movies its spoton in terms of how i imagined the character  angry burnedout and filled with selfdisgust because hates what he is and yet knows its the only thing he does well  i think some elements could have been done better but i think this film deserves a solid three stars,cruel
returns to an action movie we see him as a human rescue boatman without fighting for american interests the film holds a special interest to the end,cruel
this is simply an unapologetic throwback to the 1980s video days of action films with little talent big muscles  as much ott action as possiblewe have here the fourth installment of and to my surprise it was enjoyable enough i appreciate the politics etc are very crude but dont take it too seriously there are more appropriate platforms in which to debate the issueswe have john trying to move on but struggling to live with what he has become in any case gives him the chance to kill lots of bad guys in very violent waystheres little to say more stallone is actually excellent in this and i cant think of anyone who could have ever have played any better than what he is it doesnt require a top level actor just someone willing to accept the character for what it isits a shortish film just 90mins and youll find it runs along fine worth it for a saturday night viewing no classic but does what it says on the tin,cruel
this film drags the series into the real world no previous film has shown the results of violence quite the the way that this one does limbs fly blood spurts and human bodies are blown to pieces and red mist admittedly the actions taken by the villainous burmese military are despicable and the retribution visited upon them is deserved but doesnt that make all of them killers understands this and hates what he is but as it is about the only thing he does well where does that leave himthis film shows you the cost of war in gory graphic detail and explains how some soldiers can come back from war but never really come home,cruel
as a kid i loved first blood part 2 and with last blood coming out this year i thought id give this entry a go in the franchise since it missed it first time roundwhile the action set pieces arent as good as first blood part 2 definitely has its entertaining merits in that its very gory and the kill count is high its only 90 minutes long and doesnt feature much continuity to the older filmsgranted the excessive nature of this film might out casual viewers off especially with the amount of gore and brutality shown here and its used to dehumanise the antagonistic forces is up against its easily the most violent and excessive entry in the franchise yet and it does make you question the entertainment of some sequencesit looks and sounds like an 80s action movie which is fun but the choreography and camera shot composition doesnt hold up to action movies such as john wick that feature continuously shot scenes however you probably wont care as limbs and buckets of blood scatter scenes its nothing special its an unnecessary sequel but its fun if you love old school violent action movies,cruel
the only reason this movie doesnt deserve a 9 or 10 is those annoying christian guys especially this bald dude should have died miserably for real though why do these cry all the time christians exist in a movie,cruel
the best in the series imho john is a soft gentle soul until its time not to be amazing movie directed by the man himself see it you wont regret it,cruel
when it comes to ranking the movies first blood part ii is 1 followed by the first movie and this one which is set in modern times and shows in full blown action its also the most violent film ever made and its worthy of an r rating watch this movie before seeing last blood this fall,cruel
what is wrong with the critics why is it that they praise tripe like avengers endgame and many more which in reality doesnt serve any purpose but criticize a superbly made film covering a tough topic like the marketing of the film especially came off as a cheap bgrade movie trying to cash in on the franchise but the movie if you actually see it leaves you by surprise and gives top class entertainment value in fact sylvester stallone who is normally criticized for his voice and accent here has very few dialogues and conveys it all through his eyes face and body languagethe movie tackles the topic of the karen rebels living conditions and their fight for freedom and independence but the movie also shows some of the brutal reality of burma which films previously havent really showndirection is top notch by sylvester stallone this man is an underrated filmmakerscreenplay and story are superb everything works well in context to the topic of freedom and the common mans fight and will to live a peaceful lifecinematography is fantasticaction is the highlight and bestinclass theres no cheap scenes all the stunts are highly entertaining without looking too fake and for once the blood and gore in cinema looks spectacular is a visual treat and doesnt seem ott unlike horror movies especially the saw franchise where the blood and gore aspect goes over the topsylvester stallone with limited dialogues conveys it all through his eyes face and body and he gives a superb performance graham mctavish comes off as a vinnie jones ripoff julie benz is pretty good and the rest are great,cruel
john is an interesting and iconic film character my first association with which was the second  third movies video games cartoons action figures etc was as an over the top one man army in a foreign country winning unbeatable wars and saving american hostages then i saw first bloodits a gritty and realistic thriller on us soil yes hes a one man army but hes going against a local police department that doesnt want a returning soldier in their town it really surprised me the first time i saw it and remains a gripping action classic plus it contains stallones best dramatic scene hes ever done so i just wrote a paragraph about a movie thats not even on this list my point is that he seemed to be a different person in each movie and then for many years i forgot about those movies then this 4th installment seemingly arrived out of the blue and just wowthis is probably the most graphically violent movie ive ever seen seems to be a broken version of the cartoon character he had become this is a most welcomed return to form the horrors of war are seen on multiple levels and from various points of view it is a brutally beautiful film it has the perfect blend of some of the over the top violence these films are known for and the gritty realistic aspects that it originated in spoiler in the novel that first blood was based on dies from a technical stand point many would argue that this is not the best movie but they would be wrong for a character who was suppose to die this is the best alternative way to conclude his story,cruel
for nearly 10 years we of all people say that robert rodriguezs machete is a homage grindhouse movie we where wrong that movie is just a crappy political thriller after the intro which is awesome after grindhouse in 2007 before machete in 2010 along came aka 4 or john in 2008 when i watched for the first time i thought it was just good because i was that pumped and over hyped for machete well i was wrong because after all this time i know is a proper exploitation movie as well as a damn good bad ass sequel this movie you have all of the cool action and sleaze heads getting blown off all practically done very well evil scum bad guys killing children and of course killing the bad guy at the end with a mean fk you look on his faceshould be played along with grindhouse planet terrordeath proof and hobo with a shotgun,cruel
twenty years after his last big screen adventure ageing cynical vietnam war veteran and trained killing machine john finds himself amidst violent turmoil in burma in this fourth film in the first blood franchise for the first time in the series star sylvester stallone takes over the directing reigns and weaves an entry that tries to get under the main characters skin and look at why he is so attracted to warfare and so reluctant to return home thoughtful dialogue abounds in plentiful supply with lines such as when youre pushed killing is as easy as breathing and live for nothing or die for something there is also a superb montage including black and white excerpts from the previous three films as finds himself plagued by nightmares refreshing at this intelligent edge it is it is however only an edge the vast majority of the film consists of explosions mass shootings and violence galore with superhumanly taking on bad guy after bad guy with nary a scratch to show for it the supporting characters are pretty bland too from a formulaic damsel in distress to a proponent of nonviolence who has to learn to be violent etc the film also never really explores why likes killing so much even though it does admittedly attempt to address the issue never to mind the mere fact that the film is interested in exploring the character renders it preferable to the third entry in the series and probably the second one too the film also features the strongest ending of all four films in the franchise with a telling elongated shot as the end credits roll,cruel
the fourth instalment in the film franchise also known as 4 or john is an unflinchingly brutal relentlessly graphic  unapologetically violent sequel that takes the one man army approach to an entirely different level is one of the most violent films ever made and presents its iconic character in total massacre mode as he decimates more people here than he has in the past three chapters combinedset 20 years after the events of iii the story of follows its titular character whos living a laidback life in thailand when hes approached by a bunch of missionaries who want him to venture them into the wartorn burma while clearly refusing at first hes somehow persuaded to help them out but when these aid workers are taken captive by the ruthless burmese army teams up with a group of mercenaries to rescue themwritten  directed by sylvester stallone opens on a gruesome note that provides a brief view of where this story is headed and while it takes its time to bring the former green beret soldier into action its absolutely worth the wait because the carnage he unleashes in this chapter is unlike anything hes done before theres plenty of gore  mutilation in store but its barbaric nature makes sense for stallone here aims to capture the atrocities humans are capable ofthe sickening savagery of burmese military regime is presented in explicit detail the script may not pack enough meat for its storyline but the complexity of a turmoiled soul that was so brilliantly portrayed in first blood resurfaces a little here after being absent from the last two instalments camerawork is dynamic pacing is uneven at times and brian tyler chips in with a thrilling score that stays within the franchises realms plus also incorporates jerry goldsmiths iconic pieces into its soundtrack which was a welcome delightcoming to the performances there really isnt much to look beyond sylvester stallone here for he singlehandedly makes this film work on so many levels with 20 years gone stallone presents as a much calmer individual who has withdrawn into a secluded existence doesnt care about anything anymore but is still haunted by the horrors of his past but hes also aware of the killer within him thats waiting to be let out and unleashes him as soon as the opportunity arrives rest of the characters are pretty useless but stallones strong input easily overshadows that shortcomingon an overall scale brings back cinemas greatest killing machine in full annihilation form and elevates its violent content to such an extreme level that its definitely not for the fainthearted or easily distressed the amount of blood that splatters on the screen during the final moments is something you dont get to see everyday and even if the movie fails in a few other aspects it works as an explosive action extravaganza thats worth your time  money an undeniably effective sequel that piles up human bodies with no remorse  delivers the goods with nothing held back is action filmmaking at its most vicious dont miss it,cruel
an aging joins a group of mercenaries to venture into wartorn burma and rescue a group of christian aid workers who were kidnapped by the ruthless local infantry unit i finished this film thinking there are people out there suffering and i can do something to help them great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence its fun watching it its complexity begins within its characters but in the end this is okay all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods against this backdrop our heroe must fight its die hard for the warmovie crowd,cruel
forgotten hero in the final installment of the forgotten hero is boldly thrown back into action by a group of missionaries during a humanitarian aid effort as usual the odds are against sylvestor stallone in his last attempt to keep his compassion for his country and people who barely exist in his memories the viewers must brace themselves for the gruesome and suspenseful ride they are taken on once more told through the eyes of the exmilitary soldier who made the choice to stay in the war zone that so many have lost touch with long ago takes the viewer through the jungle and across enemies lines to make one last effort to save the humanitarians the intent of the director sylvestor stallone depicts the story of through his eyes and actions the tragic scenes of the civil war in burma mixed with the violence that occurs force the viewer to comprehend the tale of the soldier who is out of touch with himself he is unable to recognize who he is where he came from and why anyone would try to help use of flashbacks of the prior series dramatically depict the past of which continues the idea of his journey considering that the main character and the director are the same person it is easy to comprehend his intent the audience is able to continue along with and then see the final conclusion that will snap everyone back into reality that a solution or a hard decision are not easy to make the silent and strong emotions of the throughout the film help to tell the tale of selfless heroism rather than using words this assists the viewer in learning the definition of the hero who is trying to find himself and his country use of strategically placed explosions and graphic violence in burma demonstrates civil war and its tragic loss the last installment of definitely completed the actionpacked story of the epic series with the hero who prevails one last time,cruel
first off let me say this has been the most violent ive ever seen in my life and i loved it is back and he is trying to live a simple life in thailand has to take a group of christian aid workers into burma to bring aid to the burmese people finds out that the group hasnt returned back to the states and that he has to go into burma and rescue them sylvester stallone is not only great at acting in this movie but a fantastic director i did not know that this was actually happening in burma sly does a good job bringing these horrors to life and showing how terrible it is over there the effects that went into blowing people up in this move are just mind blowing i can imagine how hard it was for stallone to argue this down to an r rating this movie brought the series to a fantastic finale and the last 20 minutes of the movie you will be at the edge of your seat i gave this movie 1010 because of the fantastic acting and all of the action after seeing this movie i feel sorry for the people of burma and what they have to put up with every day,cruel
surprisingly good film stallone still plays the part physically with all sorts of stage effects and the like hes the warrior king anonymous in a foreign land ready to turn the tide of a battleand his theme is that  does any of it really make a difference and his answer seems to be that if one can change for the better in some specific place do so and let others try to impose the old playbookso he is asked by some protestant missionaries to take them to a burmese village he does they get captured he finds out when a group of mercenaries is hired by the church to bring them back apparently no one on the river knows that hes the warrior king the head mercenary derisively calls him the boatman and thinks he could never keep up with real mercenariesneedlesstosay theres miscommunication in the breakout the mercs head to the boat with a few freed prisoners but they get tripped up and penned in by a coordinated mobile hunt with dogs and a river boat and as the baddies are beating them and about to execute them theres john grabbing the mounted machine gun nearby and going at it meanwhile a sharpshooter one of the mercs who ran with and got separated from the others provides supporting fire in short order the mercs still capable and alive take out soldiers and their weapons and just when one thought it was over the irregulars come dashing in from the hillside like the calvary and the baddies are done for gets to stab the chief baddieand calm falls upon the battlefieldthe whole thing is fairly understated despite the claims of some reviews the bloodiness is more in the pseudodocumentary footage which sets up the missionary effort at the beginning of the film the baddies are killing and chopping and blowing up and doing everything they can to kill people in various ways and theres a lot of blood and they take a lot of sadistic fun in it laughing at chowtime before going out to torture and murder again just one big game  the life theyve been taught soldiers really in name only really just gangsters gang members with uniforms and military weaponryand some complain here that it makes it too cut and dried but it is it is clear it is black and white the baddies arent just wrong they are sadistic and practiced killers like a hundred hannibal lectors if you willnow in the real world who is to say that the rebel calvary here dont also play by the same rules are there civilized factions at play here or just brutal killers on all sides script says no but in reality anyhow since we dont really see the rebels at work in this play were left to decide that either wayultimately while the character engages for the specific good in this film it appears his initial advice is also vindicated to a degree but if one faction are not baddies are not villagewide killers then the missionaries can treat sickness and do at least some things in peace and so chose correctly and the message is likely that peace now reigns for awhile and the military mission and the protestant mission did change things for the better,cruel
i was very careful when i started to watch this movie could stallone pull the same trick as in rocky and deliver a solid action movie without making a fool of himself and finish the saga in glory yes he could first blood is still one of the best action movies i ever saw and this last movie is a smooth finish to it all on his last stallone manages to tell a simple story without wanting to be more than he can be you never feel that you are facing the old actor who wants to be young again this approach is very intelligent indeed and suites both the actor and the story like a gloveof course there is exaggeration when it comes to action but thats not new in fact the story is very balanced and well told stallone stays true to his character and his character clichs with everything developing in a nice tempo with beautiful jungle and river scenes when it comes to the real deal the movie delivers the most incredible heavy brutal and impressive combat scenes sparing nobody from the ruthless of wara good movie,cruel
in this latest installment john has retreated to a simple life in a rural thai village near the burmese border capturing snakes for local entertainers and transporting roamers in his old pt boat following repeated pleas helps ferry a group of christian aid workers into wartorn burma where the local karen villagers are regularly tortured and massacred by major tints sadistic soldiers the humanitarian mission is going well until the village is attacked and the missionaries are kidnapped and is once again asked to transport  but this time a group of mercenaries assembled by the missionaries minister on a deadly rescue mission this time he doesnt stay behindso farthis is the only movie besides first blood that i have seen so faralthough this movie isnt as comparable as commando its is an entertaining and bloody movie that action fans will just want to see,cruel
looked like a joke from the beginning sure sylvester stallone brought back rocky in rocky balboa and the movie turned out to be better than anyone expected but bringing back too that seemed like a bit of a stretch and while the trailers only perpetuated how voraciously violent and ridiculously over the top the film would be it continued the joke tooafter a minor lesson on the civil war in burma the film picks up with stallone in thailand being paid to catch deadly snakes for a crowd pleasing daredevil show a group of christian aid workers approach him for help into the war torn nation and despite his warnings he takes them of course things go wrong and the workers are kidnapped and as the trailers have already told you gets sent in to help albeit as a boat man for a group of mercenariesthere really is not much else to say about the film despite running in at around ninety minutes it takes more than half the film to arrive at the first sequencing involving the group of mercenaries i realize that they wanted the film to have some sort of substance but by making the audience wait for the ballstothewall action to begin the film kind of lost me i know a few scenes including a small black and white flashback to scenes from the original three films are thrown in for nostalgic reference but the film does not seem anywhere near as heartfelt or meaningful as rocky balboa it seems more like stallone hit gold with a sixth rocky and rushed head first into without totally thinking it through but of course having never seen a movie i could be wrong in thinking that there was too much emphasis put on waiting for the actionthe film also does not deliver any character development or even useful dialogue stallone spends most of the first half of the film saying go home a lot and looking downtrodden and depressed he obviously snaps out of the funk by the time he heads into burma himself but that is hardly a development none of the aid workers are really given personalities or motivations other than wanting to help and the mercenaries are seem like aggravated caricatures of better written groups from other films it also does not help that none of them seem to have any useful lines and are all frightened of stallone even when he is going all emo the bad guys in burma are not much better and despite a plethora of dialogue do not seem to be all too menacing whether that is because we know will give them their just desserts or not is rather unclearthe action when it does eventually pick up is fast furious and unrelenting there are some very violent scenes in the early moments in the film but hardly any of them qualify as action until gets involved i liked its relentlessness and its unforgiving sense of violence and can greatly appreciate the fact that the film did not have any of its blood toned down to be closer to a pg13 this is the first rrated action film in a long time to just drown in blood and i think it benefits the film in more than a few ways limbs fly people lose their heads people are incinerated and that is just the start of some of the pain throws down and what makes the action even greater is that it is not edited in that awful music video style like so many other modern action flicks it stays on the action maybe for a little too longwhile live free or die hard was a great entry for die hard films it lacked what the series was known for just so it could make a ton of money keeps it in and whether it makes a ton of money or not will probably be much more appreciated by fans or just action movie junkies in general in fact strip away the first fifty minutes of the film and leave just the scenes leading up to the final battle and the final battle itself and i think this movie could have been a solid action romp but making us wait way too long for the great action to kick in is a bit of a disappointmentwhat i was also not a fan of was the general message the film had about the struggles in burma early in the film we see more than a few burmese villagers getting killed for almost no reason are we supposed to be learning something from this or seeing it as a form of entertainment i realize that stallone wanted to make a point with some of the sequences and he does for the most part but by glamourizing the violence for the entirety of the film albeit more so in the late stages than early on it just seems like a little too close to reality and far too close to bad taste i was not necessarily disgusted by it but a little offput by how harrowingly violent and sad it was especially for a silly throwaway action film it does not help that the writing does not make for giving good messages eitherwhat was a bit of a surprise for me was the lush cinematography the jungles are beautifully captured and the picture perfect villages look brilliantly authentic in certain cases it even looks too good for the movie it is being featured inwhile there are some great action sequences to be found the film is bogged down far too much by the first half taking away some of it and adding in more nostalgia could have only made the film more worthwhile5510,cruel
wow congratulations users for boosting to the top 250 this film is so great i will tell you what stallone is so old in this film he spends a majority of his bloodbath standing at a jeep mounted gun there is tons of swearing and no redeeming intellectual dialogue to save the script the film is so mish mash it never takes a breath to let you see what is going on the trilogy didnt really have that great of track record so not much is being ruined by this installment but again a truly horrendous film that is overrated why did they take such a serious approach to a laughable character if i remember correctly he revisited vietnam to payback the vietnamese for the vietnam war i loved the violence but would have liked it to be a little more inventive once you have seen the trailer you have seen the whole film the only redeeming quality is the sniper scenes troutman would have boosted this a few stars especially if he was s father,cruel
i really had high hopes for after all i loved stallones return to roots story of rocky balboa sadly i felt none of that herecame off to me as a character who stallone wanted to bring home but couldnt bring home effectivelywe see having flashbacks living out in the wilderness with no sense of closure catharsis or redemption for himself so he stays out there not trying to change the world anymore just staying out of its wayin the end does the right thing to save the lives of a group of voluntary idiots who shouldnt have been out there in the first place they definitely did not appear to be volunteers for any organized group i could imagine no one is that illpreparedin that regard they reminded me of the group from cannibal holocaust with tossed in to tip the scalesthe movie ultimately i found boring characters unbelievable and editing choppy and lacking fluidity or ease and then it just sorta ends with coming home to his dads farm,cruel
stallone is only good thing in this film  he plays good believable role in poorly written script with lot of violence senseless cruelty and illogical actions it is more like a desperate attempt to get some of the old glory a pity that it didnt worked quite good camera mediocre cut few poor dialogs mostly no notable music except slight variant of main theme there is only one flashback reflecting the original saga that tells us nothing about it for those who dont know it the motives of main character are also hidden very well almost not existent i would only understand this part as a kind of conclusion to the saga which was on similar level as for rocky but with less emotions and more disgust from all the unnecessary blood,cruel
aside from the excessive gore this movie is so sad first off why did they call it i mean besides the obvious attempt to cash in on a classic action flick what does this movie really have to do with the original first blood series oh waitwas that john in we had to be reminded of that with several weak flashbacks to the previous films and by his name branded on his duffle bag aside from those lame reminders this film has nothing to do with the classic action series why is john a boat captain catching snakes in southeast asia just miles down river from the war torn burma if he is laying low and trying to forget the war its ludicrous and speaking of the war in burma we the viewers are treated to the usual modern hollywood hostelstyle violence children being butchered women being raped children having arms cut off people getting slaughtered in the name of amusement at the hands of a brutal regime this movie is about as creative as a coloring book we are treated to loads of slimy and visceral brutality just for the hell of it if you want to see shocking i recommend italian horror and exploitation films not bigbudget weinstein brothers schlock was sorry3 out of 10 kids,cruel
its not only that sylvester stallone is getting too long in the tooth for this kind of role its not that its got the worst script in moviedom its not even that the acting is laughably bad its that its so bad john should have been killed off ages ago in fact give it up mr stallone you cannot act you never could please for the sake of future generations give it upits also needlessly pointlessly violent the audience that watches doesnt care about the millions being killed in burma all they care about is the action in fact when i watched it several youngsters actually cheered in the massacre scene wtf had this kind of violence been in a movie directed by say oliver stone the audience might sit up and take notice like they did in hotel rwanda and the last king of scotland but the target audience of is not of that ilk,cruel
the action scenes were pretty good and the plot line was soso but there are just too many bad elements to make this a good movie 1 there is absolutely no way a claymore mine would have an explosion that large it looked like a small nuclear blast 2 theres no way that any 50 cal could cut someone in half or even decapitate a person with only 1 round not even if you were using he ammo 3 having the mercenary fire a round into the air would do nothing in a real battle ambiant noise proximity to the shot etc 4 when cuts the guy gut open toward the end we see a lot of blood pouring out there is no way this could really happen as the abdominal area of any person has very little blood circulating through it 6 all of the blood used didnt even look like blood the coloring and consistency were wrong given all of those facts i would still watch the movie again if for nothing else then just to have something to make fun of i think that this was stallones last attempt as an actor unfortunately it turned out to be a failure,cruel
last night i saw for the second time first time seeing it on the big screen and i waited to give my review until ive seen in a theater there were about 120 seats taken out of about 200 and it was the opening night in the town i live in but still i was surprised so many came to see it the audience was 90 male and most of them seemed to be working class and kids that didnt go to high school or so i presume some familiar faces from the university i study in were there but mainly capheaded working class people some chuckles through out the movie fck off alright fck the world you say something mate and when sly rips the guys throat cuts the head off and when school boy shoots the head off from a boat man a group of people clapped a bit after the showing but overall the atmosphere in the theater was quite tame and response wasnt overly ecstaticwhat i thought about the movie well it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be clearly better than ii and iii but thats like saying stalin was nicer than hitler the movie is boring as hell it sure does shed some light to a serious matter but so what does it automatically make the movie worth seeing and entertaining no sly seems to think that the key to make a good action movie is to kill as many people as possible i get it the situation in burma is horrible but you dont have to push it down to my throat im not that stupid nevertheless the battle in the end is quite satisfyingthe pacing of the movie sucks i dont know if pacing is the right word but the film bounces too much from place to place first and the mercenaries are on the boat lewis is whining and what not cut to the camp where bad men are cut back to the boat and still lewis is whining about the same things as two minutes ago then again cut to the camp and then back to the boat this kind of thing i see on 24 five minutes pass and nothing really happens the mercenaries are introduced but this could have used some tightening and rewritingim not gonna say anything about the acting because there really isnt any people just are there and what else can you expect from a movie the script is a complete ripoff from the previous two piles of cow crap just when you think sly wouldnt dare use the rebels save the day thing from part iii what do you know there come the rebels sly is apparently so out of ideas and cant come up with anything he hasnt already done why make the movie if i may ask the film is boring until saves the day with his bow and arrow from there on the movie picks up and is quite entertaining it took 40 minutes to start the goddamn movie the escape from the camp sequence is only ok but better than anything so far in the movie then some running and a bomb and because of apparently very stupid soldiers it blows up then theres the final battle which somehow is the best part of the movie even though its total mayhem sly just stands there and makes faces and shakes a bit thats tough man so tough that it must be tougher anything matt damon doesthe baddest of baddest people seems to be gay right did i catch that right so he is already a very bad man but then on top of that hes gay so that makes him even worse is that what slys trying to say overall better than ii and iii and sly can direct somewhat entertaining action slow start bores you so much that even the moderately fine finale cant save this disaster 410,cruel
in this case you pay for stallone drawing lots of blood you got it lots of it with many semicreatively designed ways of their countless means to an end blown up shot stabbed ripped out by the throat shot many times clusterbombed even an arrow for good measure if you like that in your movies which i might add means violence in japanese is the movie of the week or month or so this isnt to say sylvester stallone doesnt make his baby into what he calls as antiwar perhaps by the sheer ferocious attempt at this stuff where its not even black and white in perspective but just black then theres almost a fascination with that aspect of it of things just being in a terrain that may mean to be earnest in messages helping on another is good not so much change one supposes but comes off as something else completely the enemy has no personality aside from carnal killings and lust moreso the killings which is apt for the only dimension coming from a flashbackdream for with clips from the past moviesdoes however with these comments about the violence work as a narrow genre entertainment stallone works well at this stuff if he can fit the part with him as with many action stars works when less is more ironically he has a lot more to work with in terms of scope than say the first film i havent seen the other sequels yet while stallone stumbles from the form path of save the people thats your mission trajectory of the plot with the flashback theres almost a cartoonish quality when he stays on track theres a lunacy to a character like even as he acts as a superhero for anyone within fifty yards of his reach or running length to explain the premise is beyond the point except that this time is a roguerenegade in the jungle who catches snakes is recruited by a church group from colorado to go into burma and then has to rescue them by any means necessarythese means are like a common 80s action film on steroids which might be the saving grace for the actual script unexpectedly heartpounding the action goes on and on in a big section of the picture but there is also a sort of latenight takeover of a burmese prison camp and a chilling scene involving some burmese pirates along the river the actual theatrics of seem to hit the kind of ground that made apocalypto look as trashy as it really was is smart as junglescented bricks but at least its got some attitude from a dude in his 60s like stallone no less,cruel
in what must be the most awkward sequencing of titles for a film franchise the fourth installment titled as though it was the firstshows the side of the character that i was expecting while watching the first film we get john in all his green beret glory taking no prisoners and killing all in his wake quite the departure from his introduction as a misguided expat pushed too far into exploiting the bigotry and weakness of a local sheriff and his deputies i guess having a faceless enemy in asia helps aid in his lack of humanity we dont get any background on the burmese people or general leading the charge they are the bad guys and and his mercenaries are the good i guess life is easier and a whole lot more brutal when it is so starkly black and white the film is entertaining and surprisingly well put together however where the taut thrills and emotionalphilosophical battles in s head brought some depth to first blood the carnage and mostly silent soundtrackbesides the explosions and gunshotsof this new creation bring the adrenaline level to a boil if leaving any semblance of story way behind at the ten minute marki think that sylvester stallone may speak fewer words here per minute than arnold schwarzenegger did in terminator 2 his thousand yard stare is prevalent throughout and while comical at times delivers on its meaning here is a man beaten and done with america and all the hypocrisy of letting their people fight for freedom yet share in none of it upon their return he has found his way back to the jungles of his rebirth as a killing machine living a quiet life in thailand hunting snakes and ferrying people up the river when a group of missionary aid doctors arrive looking for transportation into burma he reluctantly acquiesces to their request only when those men and woman are captured does he feel the burn for blood and revenge he doesnt go back with the mercenaries hired to find them for complete bloodlust though he goes back because despite his warnings these aid workers went into the chaos to help they decided to live their lives with meaning despite the consequences and that dedication woke the sleeping giant inside of himstallone is actually quite good albeit a far cry from his debut in the role over two decades ago he has the conflicted silent face down pat and the anger brewing inside perfectly released when necessary as far as his writing goes there isnt all that much to the film besides finding a reason to go into burma and take out some genocidal maniacs directingwise is where the surprise came how much credit goes to him and how much to his dp i dont know but the display of brutality is handled well through extreme closeups and realistic dismemberment he never shies away from showing off blood and guts which at first was appropriate then later a bit excessive to show one or two heads explode is ok when they keep coming you start to get bored and realize he is doing it to cover up the lack of plot the effects are totally just used to pad the runtime but for what its worth they do their jobas for the supporting cast we are given a lot of people in very small roles unlike first blood where we got a couple characters that were fleshed out fully and allowed us to either like or hate them these people here are mostly just pawns used in the game julie benz is actually not that good as sarah one of the missionaries when we first see her she has a look of fear and shyness not quite in her element while her boyfriend asks for help however when he is turned down she all of a sudden takes control and works her feminine charm to gain his services so maybe it wasnt her fault as an actress but stallones as a director whichever the case her character just didnt know exactly what it wanted to be on the other hand 24 regular paul schulze is great as the leader of the aid workers he plays the prick well and as the film goes along his evolution as a person is accurately portrayed the mercenaries have their charms also tim kang is a favorite of mine from his multiple commercials and its good to see him in a feature film while matthew marsden as schoolboy is great playing the one gun for hire that has some morals and does it for more than just the moneywhether not seeing the two entries that are sandwiched between first blood and helped or hindered my enjoyment i find the two films very nice companion pieces we are first shown as a man trying to assimilate back into society and have compassion for his fellow man while also knowing he must get to them before they take him down but then with this new film we get to see what it was that made him into who he is the skills and ability to take down an entire army on his own john is the consummate badass and stallone shows that even with age that stigma can come across and still not feel completely out of place,cruel
despite all good intentions of showing the brutality of the regime in burma or myanmar as the junta prefers to call it i think stallone made a terrible mistake in mixing this into an action movie that aims to entertain the special effects and production are all top notch but in the end its all just sickening if you want a good portrayal of the situation in burma read saving fish from drowining by amy tan if you want a movie which takes violence seriously see man bites dog by rmy belvaux if you want to be entertained see i if you want all this mixed together in one nasty soup i guess iv is the movie for you,cruel
is the fourth movie in the series of violent action films starring sylvester stallone as the vietnam vet john its a more realistic movie than the ones from the 80s its less cartoonish and cheesy sylvester stallone even keeps his shirt onsadly the extreme and sadistic violence drags it down heads explode people are eaten by pigs women and children are raped and in one of the most disturbing scenes a burmese soldier grabs a baby out of the arms of the mother and throws him into a burning hut the good thing about this movie is its religious themes and that it deals with the persecution of christians in burma but it feels exploitativethe sadistic violence against those people is only there so the audience can cheer when massacres the badguys in the most gruesome ways possible i remember some people cheered and clapped their hands when the sniper took one soldiers head off im not saying that its always wrong to go to war or act in self defense im not even against capital punishment for the most dangerous people but killing is a serious matter it shouldnt be fun we shouldnt enjoy seeing people get killedthis movie should just have been a drama movie like gran torino imagine if people went into this movie expecting a violent movie and got the exact opposite instead a thoughtful movie about war and faith maybe 5 will get it right,cruel
the whole movie revolves around a pretty stupid white chick everything happens because of her she convinces with some utter bs long talk to give up his peaceful life for another suicide mission  even though he was quite unwilling to do that before than he goes back for more when the chick gets kidnapped how predictable and does the whole usual thing  wrecking havoc killing hundreds of men getting almost killed  for this one girl no higher morals no riches no nothing  just a thank you from a silly white girl they dont even really care about the locals at least this film has some pretty good action scenes that huge fighting scene near the end compensated for my lost hour before that but i still consider this a bad movie,cruel
this is not the stallone we know the guy looks old feels old and is old his face has lost consistency like latex when it has been stretched to the limit too long also i think hes wearing a wig toohe should have spared us the exposure but no he had to made a fourth edition to the serieshe very shrewdly tries to get our sympathy by making the lead villain a very bloodthirsty and generally unpleasant character to be around withthen he makes his appearance and jumps into the fray guns and custom built machete or what the hell do you call it  to bootya stallone gore is good but in your hands it is bad overall conclusion it doesnt need a brain surgeon to give one 1 bad movie sorry kids its time to watch bugs bunny again 2 bad acting as if stallone ever did know how to act 3 bad editingstallone gave the editor some rusty garden shears 4 bad musical score stallone with a synthesizerhell 5 bad casting these people were so desperate for a handouttheynb it is advisable to phone your shrink after watching this film for symptoms of brain damage,cruel
you know stallone made a new rocky movie too rocky balboa and a new movie it would be better if the title was called john in rocky balboa stallones direction and script were subtle so i had expected the same thing in but it was a huge disappointment i still dont know why stallone did that has he changed or something else firstly besides the lack of subtle direction there is not lots of action like the previous movies i mean the second and the third one not first blood in the movie in the first half i had waited action but the introduction was too long so disappointed i dont count the short boat scene the movie consists of only three action sequences but even if it seems enough somehow unsatisfying as for the claymore scene i had not seen such an explosion before in my life it is also weird that in this movie is like a supporting actor after years and years i had expected to see him on the screen more but instead watched the rescue team the missionaries and the burmese army i thought to myself is this because of the duration of the movie it might be but the previous movies were not long almost the same duration so it shows that there is something wrong in this movie i felt like it was one hour the biggest flaw of the movie is himself he was like a totally different guy it was not john it seems that this guy enjoys killing people and in extreme brutal ways it seems that he is hunger for blood violence he is not hunger for rescuing or surviving for example the boat scene remember what he does to the pirate who leaves behind however there are much more worse scenes tears a soldiers throat like a savage like a monster or he breaks a soldier almost in half by his machete innards are scattered etc where is john we know in terms of direction it is the same either it is not stallone it is not the man who directed rocky the long final sequence is probably the most brutal violent and extreme battle scene of all time soldiers are disintegrated heads arms legs and bodies are disintegrated with lots of blood of course this made gore fans glad thats why its rating is such high i cannot believe that how stallone did that there are more flaws unfortunately the script is third class like some shots there is a bizarre scene that we cannot understand what is going on a group of burmese soldiers keep a few girls in order to rape but they use a kind of firework then the place is filled with smoke so the disagreements between and the rescue team the attitudes of lewis the relationships which are vain at the beginnings and get better later and the rebelss support are clich and also all these make the movie cheap linda cannot be a new co bao instead sorry but her acting and sometimes even her existence in the combat zone were annoying she just screams what is the point by this movie stallone made critics right about violence probably now they cheer up which is so frustrating may be he vented his anger on critics may be he just has changed,cruel
plot 5 out of 10 generic action movie that stars john thrill 6 out of 10 although sometimes you are anxious towards what might happen s persona pretty much settles down the anxiety once you remember hes pretty much unstoppableentertainment 7 out of 10 brainless but thats all we want on a movie rightsoundtrack 5 out of 10 mehspecial effects 6 out of 10 some weird cgi blood effects here and therefinal score 58 6summary just another movie they try to put some drama in the scene throwing in some humanity stuff but you dont care most of the time youre just waiting for the slaughterfest and at the end thats pretty much what this movie is,cruel
first sorry for the bad english im german you dont expect an oscar film with good dialogues but you expect a film with good action and an entertain factor like the expendables  but isnt reaching even that its a dumb that entertains a bit but you cant talk this film in any way serious  is an overrated film with many plot holes and only in the end good action when you expect a dumb entertaining film like the expendables you will be disappointeddont watch this film watch better action films like crank or other great action films that have a lower rating than this one,cruel
first let me qualify my appraisal of by saying i love first blood despite its many flaws flaws that include the ultracheesy colonel trautman and the fact the film smashes the viewer over the head with its rightwing political poppycock all it was missing was a rebel flag or a coloured or homosexual womens rights protester being castrated or shot in the head in every other scene to really capture the rage of an emasculated white america in need of a hero like that said it first blood was a tense actioner and an early character study of the now clichd haunted warweary reclusive exvietnam elite special forces dude fated to kick arse once againwhere first blood was bright and original leaving aside the fore mentioned rightwing rhetoric 4 fulfills its obligations to the subsequent sequels continuing their legacy and making only passing nods to the spirit of the first film and offers very little to merit praise  save the massive bodycount and computer generated gorethe violence of was a talking and selling point sure war films have become more realistic with their violence recently with big films like private ryan thin red black hawk however the increased violence has served the purpose of focusing the audience on the harrowing circumstances of war and is matched by the filmmakers attempt to render the strain of combat upon the combatants involved and their relationshipsmakes abstract gestures at humanity that might be confused as genuine but it is all about the violence like the character the film feels fake his motivation feels fake the events seem ludirous but according to sly this is supposed to highlight the very real suffering of the people of myanmar to whom is this message intended most of the people that are attracted to such a stupid violent movie wont give a rats arse about little chinamen in myanmar such viewers actually believed sorted out their problems for them in 12  3 alreadycertainly delivers the violence but the of 2008 is not the of 1984 firstly stallone looks like a smooth plastic action figure that has been put in the oven to melt and contort i doubt the character would have gone in for unnaturally distorting plastic surgeryi appreciate the spirit of the project  presenting ultraviolent action because modern warfare involves ultraviolence often distorted by media and washington spin into some kind of sterile clean affair for the boobtube masses the problem is is just as distorted and warped in its depictionthe american only helps the myanmarans because a bigtitted blonde american woman is scripted to inspire pathos in us the viewers by her concern for the poor myanmarans this is puke goes in and kills all the evil myanmarans so they stop killing the good myanmaransso once again a weak coloured people require the services of the big white american cock to come and sort out the other weak coloured but distinctly evil coloured people of course it is fascistic violent pap hell that is fine but why do we need the tears of a white american woman or to make this plot work and the myanmarans achieve their freedom ostensibly from themselvesanswer hollywood,cruel
this was a truly disappointing movie those who have seen the three predecessors have an idea who is and how he came to be where was the character development in this movie the mercenaries and the relief workers were overlooked through the whole movie did the mercenaries die what happened to them it was the sylvester stallone movie it was all about him and he wanted us to know that the dialog in the movie just didnt make any sense and it was so bad they could have made various grunting noises and made it ten times better either you live for nothing or die for something dying for what he must have killed 2000 soldiers just to rescue 2 people in the whole movie the mounted machinegun would have overheated by the time he killed 15 of them and it looked like he shooting all over the place instead of watching his aim the bad guys had some depth but it was only the evil that the producers wanted us to see they rape they cause genocide to villages they kill they pillage they torture and maim innocent people and their general rapes young boys that much they proved to us in this movie but it wasnt justifiable enough to make such a poor production the only reason why i didnt give it a worse score was because of the special effects and its creative kills,cruel
i will grant this two and half stars for ultraviolence and a unique way of showing peoples limbs exploding from their bodies but not much else john is the mono syllabic killing machine who just cant walk away from the war torn jungle after read morehe grudgingly agrees to take some christian missionaries up to burma surprise surprise the burmese government capture them then its up to and a team of mercenaries to go in and save themwhich they do the endi would like to say there was a kink in the plan or escalating threats but really and company go in and get the hostageswhile the guards are distracted getting drunk and rapping captive women or in the case of the general young boys then theres one more big fight and thats all she wrote and while the blood does come in buckets and the violence pretty extreme even by modern standards its all packed together right at the end while may now be an unstoppable and efficient killing machine hes not a very entertaining one to watch the bad guys dont really get back the upper hand and the fight gets pretty one sided and loses its drama and flair i was fine with watching two hours of shoot em up action its watching 45 minutes of stallone give himself face time and a half hour compressed executions that gets truly tiresome,cruel
this was a truly fantastic film the plot was thin the character development was soso and the action was great just what i wanted i didnt want gone with the wind type greatness out of this movie i wanted john wreaking havoc on some well deserving bad guys thats just what this will give youif youre looking for a pure entertaining mindless action film this one delivers if you expect anything else youre watching the wrong film stalone is getting a little long in the tooth for the action roles but i think he did an admirable job with this one he was playing an old guy anyway so its not like he was out of his element if you are a guy 18 to 35 and want a great movie to watch with your pals while throwing back a couple of beers this is your movie,cruel
dont expect a classic movie dont expect a huge story line its another action pack movie im a big fan of sylvester stallone since childhood and honestly this movie was a great trip back to the old times the action was bloody and real thats how people die and get shot not like your typical rated pg movies not much of a story line since its only an hour 22 minutes long acting was decent the action was amazing some people thought too bloody but come on thats what you had to expect from a movie people forget the scene was in nasty sweaty humid southeast asia and it aint suppose to be a high tech type of movie in conclusion definitely a fun action movie and its good to see sylvester stallone back in action after a while keep on rockin brothaaa youre never old ,cruel
i just had to comment on this movie i was practically dragged to watch this yet another flick but this movie captured me from the word go stallone puts together a classic air around him that gives war such unexplainable allure but yet again doesnt make one feel weird and sick at the same time anyone who likes 24 will love this employs the characteristic jack bauer no mercy tack and pulls it off beautifully this is one movie you wont tire off but be warned it is not for everyone if you prefer a little less blood on your screen keep well away from iv but if you love your adrenaline cranked this is a must watch savour it for it may be the only in that calibre,cruel
some of the most graphic death scenes in recent historyand some of them i am guessing are pretty realistic never actually blew a guy apart with a 50 cal and never want to this is action at its best and most grittieststallone was in true form for this movie stoic defeatist and honorable in personality unbeatable and spontaneous in actionthe story is straight forward and perfect for a action movieput em inget em outwe have black and white teams and the rarely added dimension of gray in a action movie the mercenarysi loved this movie from start to finish,cruel
everything was really put up on fire here first of all stallone looks amazing for his years we should take his body as an example and prove to ourselves we can do it no matter how old we are about the movie a really good actionpacked realistic production that we will take you the most bloody messy and gore effect of all the series yet in the beginning i was really worried how the heros story will continue hopefully it was really good is still the warmachine but now there are some feeling getting into his iron heartbut i dont want to spoil the story for you so just see this movie i highly recommended to every action movie fan and also for those who havent heard of the dvd for me personally is a must have and i will definitely buy it if there is something i didnt liked about the movie is that it ends those were the first long hours i really liked about a movie productionand i didnt regret them im rating it ten because its just one of the action movies from a long long time it is true that is not something about mafia gang member or vice verca but still this is and its good very good,cruel
for the last years read since first blood ii we actionmovie lovers have had to suffer the die hards the terminators 23 you cant kill anyone thats an order and other movies where killing people was politically incorrect it seems our wait has finally come to an end from an unexpected source when i first heard sly was making a new i was very skeptic about it i mean whos waiting for a grandpa running around in a bush with a knife well i was very wrong about this the latest installment is perhaps the best action movie ive ever seen there arent many other movies around that show the brutality of warcombat like this the landing of saving private ryan comes to mindall in all this movie is top notch as far as im concerned get your popcorn put your brain on zero and just enjoy the nonstop action ,cruel

this is a very fun film with a strong message concerning the fate of americans it is about moral ambiguity just like gone baby gone but in a different tone you can definitely argue on both sidesthe world had just experienced the korean christian medical support team hostage incident which ended with people blaming missionaries for months now its john to say something about it go homein a firm and heavy tonethat is all to say as a christian myself i way firstly annoyed by the negative portray of the missionaries especially the stubborn and nearly foolish michael who is the leader of the medical team but then i start to realize that just like what we saw in apocalypse now you cant sell idealism in such an aggressive manner no matter where because if you are wasted instantly it is wasted for nothing yet the living people would be bound sacrifice even more to save you near the end of the movie and sara gazed at each other without a word which implied that maybe neither of them is the right person in that imagined burma but only go home is right stallone reaffirmed this message in the last shot of the moviewhile on the other hand it can be argued that the medical team just like the korean medical team are just innocent and not aware of the true threatens of the environment or in short they are not to be blamed but i am the pastor of the christ church of columbia and i am hiring mercenaries to save my missionaries can you lead them the way ironic huh i sincerely hope that in the future i wont be stubborn and selfish enough to pursue anything while leaving the responsible persons killing to save memy friends are all chilled by the gore and violence in the movie while some people are blaming stallone for slaughtering people like eating tofu my father who had the true war experiences in southeast asia would give it a big nod that it is very brutally and nostaglialy realistic810 the movie is very well paced the noticeable flaw is that its only 91 minutes,cruel
no other movie in the series displays the intensity and cruelty of war as does stallones new adventure this new film is violent crude dark and serious stallone captured the essence of war in this epic film its fatalities and all elements that surround italso he got into the development of his character many years have passed and we see an older angrier bitter and disappointed who is haunted by the demons of the past and the traumas of war in the end leading to find closure and to heal coming back homethe action in the film is constant and s courage and heroism is present through the whole film the scenery is amazing and the camera work is awesome in the battle scenes there are more characters helping this time so it gives more credibility to the story being that he is older and does not have the stamina and muscles he had more than 20 years agothis is a must see film for all of us who grew up in the 80s and or rocky were our childhood heroes or just for anyone that wants to watch a great action film,cruel
is blinding i went to see it for a laugh got more than i bargained for forget all the negative reviews most of those are written by sour feminists whod rather promote some braburning agenda than see artistry unfold before their eyesferries some god botherers up the river to burma he fancies the chick the dogooders get kidnapped by the brutal burmese army cue a bunch of hilarious hard edged mercenaries primed to inflict some apocalyptic violence on these aggressors they treat boatman like an imbecile but sly proves his worth rescuing their arses by firing arrows into crazed militias faces with unbelievable precisionthey rescue the captives the army send out the hounds improvises with an unexploded world war 2 bomb he tricks the pooches and they drink an 80000 mega tonne explosion which must have killed at least 500 people what with the rippling aftershockchops the top third of some army generals body off jumps behind a mounted rail gun and fires about 5000 rounds a minute into the jungle we see burmese limbs somersaulting through the forest rib cages collapsing heads splintering boatmen banqueting on rocket launchers eventually takes one in the shoulder how injured is he well this question is soon answered when another truckload of crazed army men arrive sensing danger ignores his wound gets secondwind jumps behind the freshly loaded railgun and lets them have it the trucks inhabitants are lambs to the slaughter majestically ragdolling as sly peppers their fidgeting bodies with titanium bullets eventually all the violence eases off has one last present for the leader of the army he plunges his knife into his gut not content with this drags said knife sideways and disembowels the poor bastardi lost count of how many times i bellylaughed during this film they dont make them like that any more its ultraviolence of the highest order thank you sly i left the theatre thoroughly entertained probably not a firstdate movie,cruel
after watching this film i felt compelled to ad my own comment i never thought i would review a film but this was such a hugely enjoyable action adventure that i truly feel that sylvester stallone has made his best action film so far sure stallone has made some crappy movies over the years but he has truly resurrected a true 80s action icon is hard as nails a true warrior the story couldnt be more simple a bunch of aid workers head up river apocolypse now style into the very hostile burma john takes them there when he leaves he receives news that the aid workers have been captured and taken prisoner leads a band of mercenaries to the rescue and this is were the film goes on to overdrive for all the violent crimes that the baddies do is like the angel of death and he is there to kick there asses and what an ass kicking he gives for a mainstream movie its probably the most violent and bloody display of awesome carnage youll see bodies get ripped apart from gun fire people get blown up throats get ripped out and makes very good use of his iconic knife this movie is pumped up to the max go see it now,cruel
sylvester stallone is working in the jungles of thailand  catching poisonous snakes for a living when he is asked to help lead a band of missionaries to a very dangerous hot spot agrees to get them there and thats it but when a preacher hires a group of mercenaries to rescue the missionaries is asked to lead and so he becomes a one man army again despite what many will tell you this is not as good as first blood or first blood part ii for one those movies are artifacts and proved classics of 80s action cinema that being said is a case of delivering what is expected and for what it promises it reasonably delivers the biggest problem i had with the flick was that villains werent given enough screen time and was quite dull we learned little about what he wanted to accomplish why he killed those in the villages and why he would kidnap american hostages the villain has hardly any dialog and if he does speak its of a foreign variety making the villain onenote clichd and overall pretty dull stallone however does work rather well in the role and despite his age carries off the action quite convincingly indeed one wouldve liked to see more oneman army heroics from sly then a group of mercenaries who add nothing to the plot and i wouldve liked to find out what happened to col sam trautman and much more the action is typically well handled except for the ending when the overedited camera starts moving to fast or shaking to distract from the shooting this is of course a shame because the action itself is decently staged enough to work on its own and needs to camera trickery i personally hate that and wish they would stop doing that in action films once again isnt perfect but it is effective action fodder that is worth seeing once especially if you liked the first two which i did 12 out of 4pretty good,cruel
this was a good action filmnot great nothing really stood out to make this the perfect film but its a major improvement over the last 2 so in that way its a major successjohn sylvester stallone helps some missionaries by driving them to burma so they can give their aid to the poor inhabitants when the missionaries get held hostage mercenaries are called in and escorts them through war torn burma to help save the christians and kill some people along the way its very simply plotted and to go along with its simple plot the actual movie only runs at 80 minutes long stallone has a screen presence and soaks up every scene hes in even with his very few lines th action scenes look good though some may say theyre excessively violent the movie moves at breakneck speeds cutting off most scenes with a cut to another or a fade off and that can get annoying but overall stallone made a pretty good movie not one that captured the magic of first blood but a welcome addition to the franchisemy rating  out of  80 mins r for violence and language,cruel
without a doubt i think the critics are all just jealous that a man of 61 can pull off after 20 years what men 12 the age cant the movie is a thrill action nice music and well done on whatever scale you want to think about i think its just incredible that they could pull it off and bring back to life again for a final run its good to see them come full circle on the entire franchise a proper ending for a legendary charactermy vote is 10 of 10 the critics may feel there is no storyline however i believe requires no introduction no preface or body just a concluding fact that he will win and thats what this truly accomplishes is a victory for all his fans thanks for taking us back 20 years and showing us how real films were made with real action heroes,cruel
sylvester stallone is as juiced up as ever in the latest and probably last filmits filled with bullets explosions bad acting and poor writing but that doesnt matter when watching because what you want bloody action is what you get and in some cases you get a lota missionary group wants to aid burmese people being exterminated by ruthless thai pirates and rebels led by a cute blond and a whiny hippie they contact at his isolated poisonous snake exhibit awesome and ask him to bring them down the river spouting curse words form a volcanic neck he doesnt help them at first but after a rather contrived explanation scene in the pouring rain is enlightened and off they gohavoc ensues soon after as and a gang of mercenaries go out into the jungle to find survivorsthe film is really violent with great scenes of bloody carnage limbs are blown off guts are dropped throats are torn and s machete and crossbow are used to perfect effectapart from some really silly dialog its an above average action film that thrives when the blood spills probably one of the gorier action films ever madewhich is a good thing,cruel
but that is after all what you would expect from a or like movie it is missing all the things that should be missing in a movie of this type sense story character dept believability quality dialog unbiased and realistic view on serious world problems it also has all the tings such a movie should have tons of dead bodies and theres not just plain old fashioned killing theres a wide array of disemboweling head chopping head exploding maiming limb ripping why theres even a guy whose neck tears off with his bare hands in short here is what this movie and all such movies basically says1 americans are always the good guys in fact americans are the only good guys in the world 2 americanized people from other countries and brits can never be as good as americans but they are ok because they try to be like americans and recognize and acknowledge american superiority 3 all other nations are losers and should be americanized or destroyed 4 violence can be good or bad depending on who uses it if its americans then it is good and is called democracy the american way if any other nation uses violence than it is bad and should be ended by american violence of course 5 violence when used by americans is the solution to all problems furthermore it is the only solution to all problems 6 if you object to violence you are an irritating moron but you will eventually have to recognize the error of your ways and become a real man by killing someone 7 if you are a genuine redwhiteandblue bloodied american hero you are bulletproof and will always win a battle against any number of members of any inferior nation that is to say any other nation in the worldim not going to rate this movie simply because the rating will greatly depend on what you are looking for in a movie if its any of the thing listed above as missing you wont like it i didnt if on the other hand you just want to see a 60 year old indestructible all american hero with a face lift killing everything in sight this is the movie for you,cruel
i went into this movie having high expectations and thinking i was going to see a really good actionadventure movie it was pretty good but what i didnt like other than it barely being 80 minutes long which i really hated was the storyline being so short mainly because movie was so short and doesnt do much stealthcreative fighting except in just a couple scenes i think just one when they sneak into the campbase like at the end he just mans a huge artillery machine gun and just shoots there is no using different weapons or running or crouching or sniping by or hand to hand fighting it was basically just lots of killing way too short and not very creative but there were a few parts i really liked so overall it was pretty good but not long enough at all nor very creative,cruel
ok so i sat through meet the spartans and today and i must say that is so much funnier i love how they used every opportunity to rip the human body in half it was like every chuck norris movie in the eighties and just made it more graphic i mean could it be easier to infiltrate a enemy camp why does care about these people unless he just wants to get laid from the girl the mercenaries were the best stereo type well i guess only one of them since he is the only one that really said anything the action was decent but it did not have the great one liners that have become accustomed to with stallone again i have not laughed that hard in a long time thanks it was entertaining,cruel
all those films suckedall were boring and plot lessalso sylvester stallone cant act at all and he always plays the same character in all his movies alwaysthis film had all the flaws of the previous and equally bad films i would say that it was even worse than the original flicks that all were dreadfulthis movie sucks there is nothing good about it dont waste your time seeing it it was so boring that i walked out of the theater after the first 15 minutes,cruel
i was quite disappointed to see that it was not a movie of 2008 where the dirty secrets of our past has become common knowledge through the enlightenment of the internet but rather low brow from the bush school of thought christian missionaries are portrayed as foolish helpless people who desperately need s brilliance to tell them what to do as we all know that all problems of the world are obviously solved through massive destruction anything else is simple nonsense its dreadfully stupid in a time where that kind of thinking has so clearly demonstrated itself to be poor the satanistsrepublicans no doubt greatly appreciate his effort though as it fans the flames of the stupid the subtitle could well be support the troops,cruel
childish edgy characters exploitation gore and a lot of pew pew who would ever want more like a real plot real social commentary or maybe a real challenge for the protagonist as opposed to the eerie equivalent of riding a lawnmower over a bunch of rats me i guess,cruel
the series has got quite negative reputation  mainly thanks to people who never even seen any movie  those movies are often portrayed as mindless and full of unnecessary violence i dont agree with that  at least regarding the first two movies  first blood  is a great actiondrama with very strong antiwar and antiviolence message  2  is a great actionadventure movie tribute to war veterans 3 was little over the top  but still decent and fun its not that bad as all the people sayin 2006 stallone had returned from oblivion with really good rocky balboa  the movie was success  so he decided to bring back  i was hoping for good conclusion for one of the most memorable characters in history of cinema  boy  i was so wrong first of all  the story  john  is basically a copy of 3 which itself was a copy of 2   you dont have to be a genius to realize that just replace afghanistan with birhma and colonel trautman with missionaries the rest is almost exactly the same talk about lazy writing also the conclusion for s journey in this movie seems to appear out of nowhere for me  it wasnt convincingsecond  the characters  the movie lacks any memorable villain or good supporting characters  neither any of the missionaries or mercenaries is likable or interesting  so  in the end you simply dont care what happens to themthird  awful direction  it seems like stallone did watch saving private ryan one time too much  the movie is full of violence and near the end its simply carnage  its not pretty  enjoyable or heartbreaking  it looks good  but thats it john lacks the heart that spielbergs movie had forth  action  the movie is very boring  its short  but it takes forever for the action to start  when it starts its not fun  because the movie takes itself way too seriously  maybe stallone was trying to make this one a war drama  but without good story  interesting characters and sharp direction it was fruitless attempt its also annoying that is very inactive for action hero  it looks like stallone is to old to play  which is strange  because in the expendables he isnt afraid to take part in fist fights and so on here  he shoots few bullets and few arrows  it looks pathetic i appreciate that stallone wanted the world to take a look what is happening in birhma  there is some substance in this story and i liked the references to other stallone movies cobra  first blood  2 its also good that uses his brain to defeat the enemyoverall its still a disappointment the high rating for jr is probably the effect of nostalgia ive heard that stallone wants to make another movie  im hoping that if that happens the next one will be a lot better  i give this one 510,cruel
something that i came to realize is that the series gets worse and worse by every installment whilst the first is a classic the second is decent and the third is a complete failure little did i know before watching this film that 2008 would be the worst of the threethere is one factor of the film that is great but doesnt necessarily redeem the film and that is the presence of sylvester stallone and his fantastic performance as the reason it doesnt redeem his character is how they played around with him for a lot of the film he was missing in the background or not doing very much i am not referring to him having very few speaking lines which i thought was great but he just seemed to be sitting down quietly rarely did he seem to get in the action and when he finally did in a scene involving him using a bow and arrow i came to realize that i was indeed watching a film stallones performance is fantastic and he still has the physical strength to play a character like even though it had been 20 years since the last filmeverything else about this film frustrated me the supporting characters were irritating the story was uninteresting the overuse of digital blood was infuriating and the action sequences seemed rather bland even with the development of computer technologythese supporting characters had far too much screen time in the film and none were very compelling the main reason being due to the late richard crenna whose character of trautman is completely missing from this film him being one of the great things about the first installment seeing him gone was disappointing this made every other character seem that much worsedigital blood is always awful and it looks just as bad here as anywhere else the overuse of digital blood becomes a frustration during an action sequence as the computer effect of blood distracts and detracts from the quality of an already low in quality film it takes away the excitement the passion the realism and even the intensity seeing computer generated blood splatter around this is overused and looks extremely terrible especially at the films anticlimatic end where the terrible digital blood is fully exposedthe action was uninteresting in the film whether it be the complete distraction from digital blood or whether it just not be good now if this is indeed due to digital blood then this couldve easily being overcome by not having digital effects and sticking to practical effects which seem far more realistic far more gory and more exciting none of the action which is really limited appealed to me in this filmthe writing and directing is pretty unbearable especially some horrible dialogue uttered from the captain of the rescue squad who was the most irritating character of the film whether it be his british accent or whether it be the jerk the character was i dont know but this character was horrible the direction is also unimpressive due to bad pacing poor storytelling and simply not having enough in the film and instead replacing this with other sequences2008 receives too much praise when it is indeed a pretty terrible action picture which is as bad if not worse than the nightmare that is iii save your time and money and simply watch the original or even rewatch it this film has almost no rewatchability in it and certainly doesnt work well as a film poor writing and directing overuse of digital blood and uninteresting action sequences make this a failure of a film,cruel
dont you hate it when you are down at the video shop or cash converters as i was and you buy a dvd thinking that it was one movie and it turns out to be something completely different well that is what happened to me with this movie i thought it was first blood but for some reason my mind did not register to the fact at the time that the first movie was called first blood and not actually my mind had also completely forgotten the fact that a forth movie had ever been made though i do vaguely remember it it was sort of one of those things that you dont even let enter your mind for fear that it might crowd out something more importantto say that this movie was rubbish is to give a bad name to rubbish which to be honest with you is something that i really dont want to do here in fact it is difficult to describe this movie without actually using any profanity which imdb doesnt like me using which is okay because it forces me to be more intelligent with my use to language in describing how bad a movie is okay i have so far spent two paragraphs telling you that i really did not like the movie and not why i did not like the moviewell for one thing it wasnt the gore because quentin tarrintino uses gore but he uses it in a very intelligent way this movie seems to not only over use it but it gets to the point where you just shake your head and go so what is the point actually the point was to raise awareness of the plight of the karin people in northern burma and to demonstrate how brutal the burmese army was okay that is a noble purpose but i have seen much better films deal with human rights issues than simply have john go bursting into burma to blow away a whole battalion of burmese soldiers with armour piercing bulletsthe one thing that i didnt like was the representation of the christians in the film come on they were just normal people that had the label of christian on them for the sake of us being horrified when they get captured by the burmese seriously churches do no hire mercenaries to go and rescue missionaries that get captured it sort of goes against everything they stand for though i would not be surprised if it did happen secondly christians generally dont go on short term mission trips into countries such as burma actually that is also false as i have known of christians going into lebanon after the war with israel however time had passed and lebanon is actually a lot safer than say burma or iraq i have heard of christians going into afghanistan but short term there was six monthsi also suspect that christian missionaries going into burma would be incredibly experienced and thoroughly mentally prepared for the off chance that they would get captured and torture simply having them as sniveling scardicats simply did not rub it with me what would i expect them to be doing well i would expect them to be doing what paul did when he was imprisoned and that is singing hymns psalms and praising the lord a true christian does not fear what the world throws at them because they know that their salvation is secure and that they are free even though they may be imprisoned however i would not be surprised if you do actually get wet behind the ear christians like this going into burma and getting into trouble mind you i would also not be surprised if some of them went off their head at john when he saved their life by killing a bunch of river pirates but once again a true christian is likely to be thankful that their lives had been saved,cruel
well for an action movie i think its a quite good and entertaining film but compared to the other three movies i think its not a suitable sequel indeed this movie was a big disappointment for me why all the sudden all the blood and gore that was my big question during watching this fourth part because it seemed to had the upper hand in the movie its a pity that sylvester stallone decided to bring it this way because this is not the case in the other three s as far as the acting performances goes its quite the opposite of the original first blood which was very well acted i think this movie is overestimated,cruel
theres something inherently distasteful about taking a reallife tragedy  the genocide in burma  and using it as fodder for yet another fantasyfueled movieafter a 18year hiatus sylvester stallone returns to one of his two signature roles the other of course being rocky  that of vietnam war vet john the worldweary and cynical reluctant warrior who in this installment is hired to lead a group of mercenaries into burma to rescue some american missionaries being held captive there may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound but he is certainly capable of wiping out a whole cadre of burmese soldiers all by his lonesome the poor people being systematically slaughtered under that regime will im sure be relieved to hear hes on his waydespite a terrifically high body count and endless footage of stomachchurning carnage its amazing just how utterly dull an action movie turns out to be stallone as always mumbles and grunts his way through his part which considering the laughably pretentious dialogue assigned to him especially in reflective voiceover narration is probably the wisest choice he could have made under the circumstances graham mctavish displays some fire in the belly as a belligerent mercenary but hes the only one on either side of the camera who seems to be putting any real effort into the movie,cruel
it is a gore fest which is what a film should be however unlike the previous action movies the action is simply stallone using a big gun and shooting down burmese soldiers who are apparently trying to murder christian missionaries the funny part is that the christian missionaries are in burma to save the lives of the rebels or some such but their misadventure and s trigger happiness generates the maximum body count of all the movies my disappointment with this movie is that there is nothing clever about the tactics or the manner in which the killing takes place think about the way in which kills the russian helicopter pilotgeneral in 3 or the superhuman military skill with which he fashions booby traps and bows and arrows from the jungle in first blood it is a shoot em up alright fun for a while but not all that good as a decent action movie,cruel
i dont really know where to begin with explaining just how awesome this movie is i mean i was looking forward to this film for about a year before its release and finally i got to see it on its opening night andwow this film met my every expectation and more the films storyline isnt really anything spectacular or very original but thats not the point after all its an action movie right and not one of thoughs new millennium actionadventurethriller type films were talking oldschool 80s style classic action movie mixed in with modern special effects of realistic ultraviolence the dialogues cheesy but the actors take their roles so seriously especially stallone that its so easy to get caught up in it without laughing your arse off the film starts off pretty tame but as the film progresses the violence and brutality escalates to such a point that by the final scene i was laughing at just how insanely violent this film is its as if every action scene has to outdo the previous and in that it really succeeds this movie is a must see for any actionjunkie and it is up there with the first film and although the film is only 80 minutes long it feels like an epic 2 and a half hour war film there really needs to be more movies made like this and hopefully this starts off a trend of real action movies again packed full of explosions instead of cgi specialeffects which seems to be the norm these days i reckon vandamme should make a bigscreen film again i mean if stallone can do it at age 62van damme can definitely do it at age 48 cant wait for the dvd,cruel
where do i start with  lets start at the beginning when i first saw first blood in 1982 i thought it was one of the best films i ever witnessed not much has changed since then and my opinion of that movie still holds strong today as it did then great story good action and good solid acting too stallone dennehy and crenna based the film superbly as for first blood part ii  i was 15 at the time and completely bought into the hype and was washed away by stallones seemingly unputoutable shining star he was at the height of his powers  rocky even cobra brought in the money in the millions iii started the downfall although not a bad film overall the whole military pull out of afghanistan by the russiona troops 10 days before the film opened in the cinemas cut its box office takings badlyand now we have a barely 75 minute long film to finish the series john is one of the most recognised movie characters of all time and for that stallone has to be commended after all he did cowrite the first films screenplay also but for me this was a film too far  or if not a film too far then a poor film too far after last years great success with rocky balboa  stallone revisits his other iconic character for one last final hurrah but where balboa was an understated sensible even somewhat thoughtprovoking film  is none of those thingsand that is a pity first blood was all that  trying hard to deal with a mans isolation and nonacceptance into a country which he had fought hard for his unit were all killed one way or another in nam and even though he was in charge of millions of dollars worth of equipment in the war  he cannot hold down a job washing cars back in the us the film  just has no real heart to it in the original john kills noone the one kill attributed to him was really an accident but now in his own words  killing is as easy as breathing and the more graphic the kill the better apparently heads exploding bodies literally cut in two from machine gun fire limbs torn apart are just standard fare in this movie i was a huge fan of the 80s and was delighted to see him make his return but the final film is just a mishmash of sequels 2 and 3 set in a different geographical location with not one thing to drive the story of the character forward well maybe one thing the notion that may have a father somewhere the end scene of is very reminiscent of the opening scene of first blood and i am sure this is something stallone wanted desperately to portray  but for me i reckon he is secretly disappointed by a film that could have been more brain but ultimately turned out a brawny exercise in killing510,cruel
i actually saw this movie about a month ago and im just now writing a review of it oh wellthis is definitely the one of most raw and violent movies i think i have ever seenmuch much moreso than the first three films the footage maintains a refreshing quality of unpolished reality many many of the scenes are for lack of a better word intense but the reminders they give and the points they make are also very valid not to mention currentand eyeopening things like that are really happening in the world right now the acting delivered by julie benz is surprisingly not uptopar not at all reminiscent of her continually excellent performances on dexter and some of the scenes between she and stallone seem almost clumsy and unrehearsed but overall the acting is solid and the films almost like youre there feel only increases the already intensebutawesome feeling of watching itstallone has delivered an absolute masterpiece,cruel
okay stallone takes more steroids and hgh than barry bonds and hulk hogan combined that said the 61  year old actor is buffer than ever his shoulders are the size of my couch his arms are rippling okay he didnt take his shirt off this time but stallone was moody wound tight and ready to snap excellent plot acting and direction the most horrifying combat scenes since private ryan it felt like you had to duck for cover this was by far the best film since first blood a complete triumph the damp rainy burmese jungle lends an atmosphere of danger and keeps your eyes glued to to the screen the mercenaries that accompany him seem like a believable bunch of hired killers stallones sudden violence and menacing presence though permeates the film and makes it work,cruel
i know there are lots of americans and europeans didnt believe this film but you are wrong stallone made a very correct point on this issuewhite people are wrong i am a taiwanese i know what exactly going on in burma in burma this is real thing this is truth i was tearing in my heart and grateful for mr stallone making this filmthank you stallone you are so right you are so nice to asiai have to say this one more time this is real this is not just a movie in burma this has been happening for many years even in 2008 it is still happeningyou just dont believe it doesnt mean you really know itthese army wont let you know when they are killing their own people,cruel
if you want to see an unbelievable amount of violence in an rrated film then look no further the story is spectacularly simple and wastes no time in splashing gore everywhere gets to team up with some mercs who enjoy murdering people as much as he does it seems theres little more to say than that but really it takes a lot to shock me and this movie had me laughing out loud in complete surprise at the mayhem entire villages are massacred heads explode limbs are hacked off heads are lopped off people are turned to strawberry jam bodies soar through the air man even children arent safe in this film and yet in the end its just not that serious stallone easily mows down like 300 enemies in this one guy gets the top half of his head blown off by a 50 caliber sniper rifle if youve never seen anyone cut in half by machine gun fire nows your chance ends like there might be another one where it all began the cinematic equivalent of a can of red bullrating  out of ,cruel
at 80 minutes until end credits this movie is still a bit too long truthfully actionwise all the twosided violence is packed at the very end nothing socially redeeming and barely hits mediocre acting not much dialog in english and except for a hand full lines all pretty banalreally pretty boring during first half except for some short bad army kills villagers clips and those no more exciting than to say the enemy is ruthless which saying the enemy is ruthless does almost as well if this movie gives you a thrill before the last 20 minutes you take too much pleasure in passively watching people gunned down without a chance  that or watching rain forest river sceneryjohn himself lurks stone faced and noncommittal until 23 the way through other than a brief use of revolver arrows and a jog through the woods doesnt exhibit the old super soldier skills he sets a claymore and lurks behind a truck mounted gun for the majority of actual action i would guess arthritis has caught up with stallonethe last 15 minutes is a chase to the climatic all out bombs and guns glory mostly fairly realistic human destruction by high caliber weapons far more than most movies are willing to show but the same old exaggerations on how easily it is to cleanly decapitate with single blowthe sniper guy is the best job of acting but he only has like 8 linesand you know this isnt a real action movie because they got julie benz and they dont flash her tits not even a wet shirt and while she stays in character as a extremely naive and none too smart christian missionary  the chances of her keeping her shirt in real life while native people are are raped and killed continuously is about nil only if she had been kept for ransom by rebels not official government forces would she have had a chance of good treatment and keeping her shirtone really odd moment is when the chief bad guy grabs a young boy from the prisoners and takes him to bed but after that everything proceeds like the kid volunteered for the role and is even released in the morning to trot happily away by himself one of the mercenaries will later refer to this homosexual act after being captured by calling the evil commander ladyboy despite lacking a view into this incident i guess somethings were cut out that would have explained all this and we end up with only random gay foreigners are evil foreigners very biblical but unnecessary,cruel
okay so right off the bat i was so excited to see this movie i love the series if you are a fan then you will absolutely love this movie it does the series justice and if it is the last one it ends on a good note stallone makes the character very believable and that he isnt the young gun that he used to be but he is still in amazing shape and can still kick some serious ass this is the most realistic and shows how intense and horrible things are in burma the story line is believable then you just get to see wreck the lives out of pretty much everyone the action is the best and you get really excited and it is so much fun to watch i love this movie and the critics have no idea what they are talking about it is a very gory and bloody movie so the little ones should stay at home i highly recommend this movie especially if you love action flick,cruel
well after years and out of the collective minds of film goers sly stallone returns back with his classic 80s war epic drama this time by the simple title of just as many became accustomed to in the 1980s with these films of a me mentality against the world in which i conquer and defeat whole armies this 2008 edition is just about similarstallone is back as vietnam war veteran john who travels up the northern thailand river crossing the burma border during classic flashbacks of montage editing the film displays his mindset as sees just about what he is to return to that is blood bodies and bombs and shootings a foreshadow of things to see from the ongoing civil war of the burmese yet despite the fact that this civil war has been raging for 60 years s mission becomes even more important as this time his rescue mission involves finding and bringing back a group of church people on aid assignmentthis film is vintage stallone with heart pounding action and explosions and the tense drama of any war epic and too its quality does compete with the 1980 films the effort and acting is good from stallone who wrote and directed you can tell he worked hard at it the theme of war and fighting for freedom from a war hero rings true with the times of now with the ever constant threat of terrorism and international conflict overall nothing great but again good work from stallone,cruel
it was a great film it was a film that you wanted o to kill them all  jammed packed action ,cruel
grew up to watching and this is the best one i know i know thats saying a lot but so much awesomeness in this flick its like kill bill violencegore wise meets saving private ryan ha both of those movies are obviously better but just watch the movie and then thatll make more sense,cruel
i must admit im a little biased when it comes to this one the first big rrated film i ever saw was first blood and like an archetype i imprinted every last minute of it the evil sheriff the shadowy disconnected mentor troutman the missionless drifter i bought it all and with a sphinctering zeal utterly unencumbered by adult awareness this experience was gratuitously repeated with first blood part 2 and to a lesser extend in part 3 when it appeared the series was beginning to ride off the back of its own ridiculousness and then a miracle like sweet sweet baby jesus a cynical snake collector still living in nam john still cares about something but needs dexters beautiful blonde wife to remind him of it strangely as i hate cgi i couldnt help but to love the never ending computer scenes of bloody limbs and spurting body parts littering the celluloid landscape it is my most heartfelt hope and deepest desire now that is home to rid his small redneck town of methhuffing skinheads please sylvester make it happen,cruel
in wartorn despotic burma the military has oppressed the karen minority john sylvester stallone has found peace in a simple life in thailand a group of christian missionaries led by michael burnett and sarah miller julie benz needs to take them up the river to burma he fights through pirates and delivers them to the villagers then the military massacres the villagers taking sarah and others prisoner the groups pastor comes to ask to help guide a group of mercenaries to rescue the missionariesthis one tries to be serious with the real world suffering of the karen people it is more similar in its moody tone to first blood is struggling with his morality in an immoral world he tries to find his faith in the face of the faithful sarah there is a clash between killing and pacifism is still suffering from his past i like the start inevitably large scale killing starts there is still a lot of overly simplistic things going on the body count is higher than ever and the kills more brutal than before thats where the from ii and iii live the rescue could have come from any number of 80s action movie except more brutal that part doesnt have the needed realism although its there for the blood splatter big explosion crowd it doesnt fully achieve the serious first blood idea and not as campy as the other two either,cruel
this film has one of the highest body counts in a film known to man the action is far from senseless and actually serves a purpose i for one hate senseless action films for there is no emotion however this is packed full of emotion due to its revenge plot and believe when you watch this film the horrible atrocities shown done to innocent people make you feel awful but the payback does more than make up for it in the endother than the action there really isnt anything new brought to the table the plot is not very witty or strong but holds up the film and the acting is not bad nor amazing but the action surpasses almost everything in the past and present and will most certainly be hard to beat in the futurethis film is most certainly worth the watch especially if you are action hungry enjoy the film and thanks for reading my review,cruel
sylvester stallone once again plays john after 20 years and proves he is most capable as both star and director story has him living in seclusion in thailand where he is enlisted by christian missionaries to help him rescue their own who are being held captive in burma by the ruthless overlords in that war torn countryfull of action with some surprisingly realistic violencewhen those big guns fire bullets you can see the real impact no sugarcoating here stallone plays as a world weary soldier who is brought back into the problems of the world and resolves to defeat this local evil before continuing his journey of selfdiscovery and fulfillment which nicely brings the series full circlewill there be a fifth and final adventure time will tell,cruel
first blood was a good film made into a great film by s final speech first blood pt2 wasnt that great whilst 3 was unfortunate that it came out just as the cold war was ending is a much more mature film as indeed was stallone at this point and it makes it immeasurably better the good the great julie benz playing a character a long long way from darla in buffyangel and still gorgeous no matter how dishevelled she gets reputedly her whedonverse costar charisma carpenter got her recurring role in the expendables after being recommended by julie in this the developing relationship between the 2 is wonderful she reminds of everything hes lost and wants back stallone is magnificent in his iconic role and the final battle is truly breathtaking one of the inspirations for was supposed to be actor and ww2 hero audie murphy and s last stand here with the machine gun is very similar to how murphy won the congressional medal of honour also kudos to sylvester stallone who with this film drew more attention to the suffering of the burmese people than amnesty international managed in decades and received death threats as a result violent as this film is you have to remember that what actually happens in burma is so much worse as graphically demonstrated by the reallife news footage we see in the opening sequencethe bad rather beggars belief that a peaceloving christian church would hire a team of mercenaries to rescue their lost missionaries would have liked a bit more character development for the mercs all we have is mr aggressive and schoolboy maybe its on the deleted scenes the idea that a claymore antipersonnel mine could set off a sixty year old bomb is pretty ridiculous the claymore spits out ball bearings like a shotgun they certainly wont penetrate a metal casing and wouldnt trigger the detonator if they did loved loved loved the ending we see just as we saw him in the opening sequence of first blood finally heading home to his fathers ranch i think s dad remarried and hes going to meet his new brothers and sisters as the song goes the road is long he has one last look down it obviously considering the past and maybe carrying on but he realises hes finally reached the end and returns to his family and his true place in the world back where he belongs at last its a great ending and we should definitely end the series here,cruel
the first film first blood is often hailed as the original slice ndice action flick the grandfather of the herogunsdownarmies films the peak of brutality of its time kind of ironic considering the doesnt actually kill anybody save the sheriff who fell from the helicopter and who nobody liked in the first place still the reputation alone got first blood unto the indexlists of many countries in german videostores the film remains buried in the adultsection to this dayby the end of first blood it became clear that john himself was the victim a broken spirit that would get the red carpet into any psychiatric hospital but the fans wanted none of that they wanted the invincible manowar the fighting machine to mow down legions of adversaries and they would get just that in the following sequelsthe early 21st century wasnt kind to our favorite actionheroes lundgren and segal produced straighttovideo schlock van damme began looking like a mean drunkard and even actiongod chuck norris was kept alive only by a row of lame internetjokes and arnold was governor a new generation of actionheroes had come vin diesel and jason stratham stonefaced and uncharismatic to the last man and the end of a genre seemed nighcome the year 2008 and stallone like a dying bull in a spanish arena rose in a final steroidfueled blaze of glory giving the new generation the virtual stinkyfinger and showing them whos the boss once and for all almost as if make sure that nobody would ever top him he broke arnies total recallrecord and took his seat on top of a throne made of skulls and disemboweled body partsthe professional critics generally dismissed the fourth part of the saga mainly due to the high gorecontent 32 percent at a certain spoiled vegetable site speak a clear language denizens of the internet saw that different hailing as a masterpiece some celebrated stallones carnage for its own sake  gutting throatripping evisceration and generally turning the human anatomy into a bloody puddle  yet others saw a distinct message war isnt pretty actually its brutal and sickening sure might animate you to play an egoshooter on your computer but doubtful whether it would animate anybody but hardened psychopaths to join any armysimilar to the original pulp novellas john shows what he is a human machine conditioned only for carnage and mayhem  and at the same time gives us a glimpse of what could have happened to the townsters in first blood if had unleashed his real furywhether seen as a movie with a message or a simple hyperviolent actionflick is the ultimate epitaph for all and like films,cruel
ok if its a complex and original storyline youre after we all know aint it but if its absolute gratuitous violence as realistic as you will ever see on a screen then boy does this film deliver for some the graphic realism of bodies being vapourised by mortar fire and arms and legs flying around will just be too much for me i wanted more i have never seen anything like this on film it took my breath away and as a viewer you do get involved you build up a genuine hatred and disgust for the militia leader who has rather grotesque sexual appetites and cruel torturous tendencies i loved this film for the simple visual experience,cruel
is one of the few classic action characters that have stood the test of time the man who speaks few words blows up things and kills all the baddies is a hero for all action movie lovers with 3 successful movies in the 80s sylvester stallones attempt to make a come back with a 4th sequel was also seen as an attempt to revive his film career well he does manage to pull it off even with the success of rocky balboa in 2006 there was a certain skepticism about the relevance of bringing back a 60 vietnam war veteran in a more sophisticated world though the idea might have seemed unrealistic once you see the bulked up stallone in perfect shape doing what hes really good at on screen all those doubts fade away live for nothing or die for something an aged but angry says holding a bow ready to pull an arrow aimed at a mercenaries face in the latest plot has been living a solitary life as a boatman and catching poisonous snakes for a livingwhen a few christian missionaries seek his assistance in taking them to burma to provide the persecuted karen tribe with prayer books and medical supplies john takes them in his boat though he initially refuses due to the persistence of sarah the only lady missionary among the grouphowever is not fully convinced that they would be able to make any change he drops them off at a location after having faced a violent confrontation with burmese pirates a few days later he is visited by the pastor of the church that sent the human rights group who informs him that they never returned back and he requests s help in dropping off a few hired mercenaries at the same spot where the group was left what follows is a non stop ride of extreme action where in the process of rescuing the hostages youll come to see the bloodiest scenes that could happen in war and may action maniacs a huge adrenaline rush for some it might simply look like a bloody action movie with explicit images but for those who understand john and love some old school action you wont be disappointed its a thrill of a ride with the maximum kills in any movie and a worthy ending to the seriesoriginal link below httppensorswordsblogspotcom201109johnreviewhtml,cruel
is an all out man film its got big guns plenty of blood and jampacked with action and thrills but why did it feel unengaged i think the big problem is with the length of it an hour and a half too short i didnt want it to end i wanted more and more and if you think about it all there is to it is invading a camp of thai people and then killing a bunch of them i needed more action this film couldve been epic if it wanted to have been nevertheless this has got to be the highest body count since kill bill but obviously no where near that standardat times can be oversentimental with its music and choice of editing and it wasnt needed in my opinion jackie stallone has made a film that knows it is all out action of course you can have the girl who needs to be saved but we really dont need all this sentimentalised music when we see a mass genocidehowever does not disappoint with its action there are limbs being sliced off guts hanging out heads being blown off heads being sliced up and it is all very very exciting the final confrontation on the massive gun is so entertaining just because of its sheer amount of bloodon the story side it is let down the characters are unengaged and slightly annoying but its still fun it couldve been more fun but its fun enough jackie is great as a director just not so good as a writer,cruel
stallone has made a great job directing this movie in my opinion this is his best effort as a director there are no unnecessary scenes dialogs or exaggerated action even the huge body count seems to be in placesuperb cinematography both of the brutal action and the marvelous landscapes no shaky camera  which proved itself as an excellent choice i actually forgot that a good waraction scenes could be done without the shaky camera but proves the oppositestallone has aged so did john nonetheless he looks fit for the role and manages to stay believable in the action much more believable then in the previous two installments other characters are just as believable same plot as before just different location however it seems that the budget was wisely invested in the crew action explosions amazing cinematography excellent dialogs curt dialogs and more,cruel
i know what your thinking you think that i am a total idiot your asking yourself how i could possibly like this better than the dark knight well i coulnt tell you why this movie is just great of all the movies in the series this is my favorite it is way better than the first blood part ii and iii and just a little better than first blood while in almost every way first blood is better better acting better directing better story etc i think what really made me locve this one was the realism sure the story is simple takes a group of missionaries into burma they get captured so he goes in with a team of mercenaries in after them it is very simple and there are so many imperfections that its just great the best scene is the final battle it is just spectacular in a gritty way that involves a lot of carnaage seriously probably 170 people are killed just be warned squeamish people this movie is very graphic not like planet terror or braindead but still gory as hell people get like ripped up by gunfire and people explode ino nasty red stains on the ground its just insane all and all its my favorite film and i dont even know why i give it a 10 out of 10 also i tink a rating of 73 is just far underrated i realize not everyone will like it but 85 at least i think,cruel
this movie reached and easily passed my expectations at first i was worried stallone would ruin the series by making a new but this by far is the best yet even though it is amazing i dont recommend letting your 9 year old see this unless you want him growing up to be some blood crazed maniac that is mainly because this is without a doubt the second bloodiest movie i have ever seen behind ninja assassin but because of that it just makes it even more bad ass so if you want to watch an incredible action movie masterpiece i highly recommend ps whoever thought of the final battle scene with that 50 caliber machine gun cutting people in half deserves a raise,cruel
this movie is by far the best of the 3 films i dont consider first blood to be a filmthe film is certainly not heavy on plot and there are no real twists but the story is simple believable honest and has very little hollywood to it war is hell and good people diethis movie is totally brutal and it shows you where has been living for the last 20 years and the ending gives the character satisfying closuresylvester stallone finally got the character rightif you liked saving private ryan then you will absolutely love this film,cruel
i have not read all the comments too long but i nevertheless noticed that many users say that this film is pretty violent well i wont say that they are wrongbut lets face the facts with objectivity and lets place the film and acts in the right context pleasei will tell what i want to say short straight and clearthis movie is no more no less than the usual topic good vs evil period stallone  is the good guy and the guerilla soldiers are the evil ones till here you do agree with me unless you are dishonest with yourselfduring more than an hour we  the audience  watch the guerilla kill rape torture slaughter civilians men women and child one hour we are under pressure literally wonder when the hell stallone will come to exterminate all those bastards  for gods sake so when he comes with his 127 mm machine gun and wipes out disintegrates vaporizes tears to pieces all the bad guys i just askwhere is the violence what is disgusting here the audience has waited for that all the film perhaps unconsciously so there is absolutely nothing awful about that nothing pernicious this violence is justified and the audience can breath with satisfaction they obtain what they asked for in the deep of themselves nothing elsei have seen some real nasty movies in my life and not necessarily with bloodshed take for instance open season 74 remember when one of the hunters  richard lynch  constrains alberto de mendoza to open his mouth so that he  lynch  can put his own chewing gum he just took off his mouth into mendozas one and with a smiling face no brutality at all this is violent to me disgusting awful terrible and again there is no bloodshedso please about the violence in john reconsider the questionplease,cruel
sylvester stallone regardless of how many times the golden raspberry awards have decided to riff on his performances is undoubtedly the source of two of the most popular icons in film history rocky and the original films for both of these icons were met with strong popularity and spawned numerous mediocre sequels recently stallone took the liberty of bringing them back with more punch than before and by directing them himself sort of refreshed what we loved about them to begin withwe first saw in the 1982 film first blood which is still the best of the series then we had first blood part ii which was simply awful iii is considered by some to be superior but the new is without a doubt the best since the originalin this film we see with a new set of eyes no longer is he the young jobless drifter being picked on by stereotypical policemen hes a rundown tired veteran living in vietnam where his comrades died flat out sick of the world he is hired by global aid workers who want to help the poor villages in the country after they are kidnapped by rebels and a team of american soldiers set out to recover them before its too late what follows is a series of gunfights deaths and bloody fight scenes some unremittingly intense but very welldonethis is a ninetyminute shootemup kind of movie the body count climbs into the hundreds and some people will find it repulsive for this reason but in a way is not a recklessly bloody film it uses its violence one to entertain and two to symbolize the horrible things which really continue to happen in that part of the world to this very day we see scenes or rebels torturing burning raping and playing with the lives of their captives and its sad but its true i congratulate stallone and his crew enormously for this effective allegoryand grand and bold as is im sorry to say that is a missed opportunity because while it covers the violence and the symbolism with flying colors what is misses out on is the character development and what i was really wanting was a real indepth characterization of as more than just a killing machine there was a brief flashback sequence which related to his troublesome past but i wanted more than that the movies only an hour and a half long and it seems way too short by that there could have been more a little more depth would have possibly given it a fourth star and i was really hoping to see more reflection on the character of colonel trautman s superior from the last three films with richard crennas passing in 2003 it was a wise move not to replace him with a new actor that would have been horrible but i was wanting more memories and reflection on such a great human character than just a few seconds of a quick flashbacknevertheless is a grand fun action movie and like i said the best since the original its just a shame that the filmmakers didnt explore the regions i wanted most and for that reason many people are going to pan this film for its enormous content of violence and deaths but for fans of big rowdy shootemup movies this will be your treasure trove,cruel
this is probably one of the best movies in terms of storytelling and filming qualityi enjoyed this no doubt but you notice early on there is a lot of classic american action movie formula to it building up the enemy as the bad guy who deserves to die horribly christian peopleamericans as the good guys a hesitant i dont want to fight john and finally a cascade of effectful killingssome people here claim that there is a moral here and that john is a guy with strong moral values thats more or less bullshit this is a poor insight to put it mildly into the burma conflict and himself isnt really believable as the guy who is forced to be a killing machine against his own will but as long as you accept these simple parts its okthe cgi is bad basically you could spot the cgi in every shot simple particle effects when people explode  as they do a lot in this movie when bullets hit them also wrong colour on the bloodthe movie is also very short the running time says 87 minutes but that includes almost 15 minutes of credits i think this is a good thing for the movie all in all i was entertained throughout i kept watching despite only intending to watch half of it it was very cool to see the hard mercenaries realize that was more than just a boatman i think they couldve made something more out of thatgreat action movie but as a movie in general pretty simple stuff solid 710,cruel
he is back and i havent seen so many dead bodies before and the bodies dont stop falling this ultra violent movie i havent had so much fun watching a movie than this one which i believe to be the best out of all the 4 sis a movie to sit down and watch when you are feeling frustrated or drunk its meir lack of depth in the story and duologue makes it fun which not many movies have now the movie never lacks a moment of excitement and never looses itwell in standard the weapons sound brilliant and visually much better than beforeif there is one violent body count movie you are going to see make it this one,cruel
wow for a wellpaced and gripping drama with a message you cant go wrong with the latest i dont think i have seen effects done like this in any movie before to me this sets a new bar for visceral realism which i can only hope will be as well done in like movies to come the story is presented in a hyperviolent manner which really serves as an ironic counterpoint to the genocide it speaks so loudly against the moral of the plot and the solution as presented by the movie makes you wonder  although i guess its a simple enough enactment of fighting fire with fire this movie is finely balanced on its own moral tightrope and could come crashing down on either side depending on the viewer i will not pass judgment on the message or the morals  you can make these decisions for yourself stallone is his usual taciturn stoic self and is in remarkable shape for his years he embodies a more mature and selfaware john well while not for the squeamish i wholeheartedly endorse this movie and will be watching it many more times on bluray,cruel
i loved this movie especially on the big screen i woulda given it a 10 rather than a 9 but i wanted to see more old style stealth kills eg like the mud n water scenes saying that however i felt stallone cut down a lot on the 80s cheese yet still gave us an 80s looking film in a good way also the direction and camera work was great the movie had elements of film graininess which was kinda nice to see in this all digital age it felt more real and filmic 4 had an almost grindhouse quality about itof course isnt gonna sit well with everyone blood thirsty violent and minimal storyline but for me those were all pluses its not the kinda film you would take youre mother to for mothers day nor is it the kind of film you would see if you were a mark kermod style film critiquebut is a balls out macho fun joyride it made you despise the villains so much that you would wish horror upon them and did not disappoint there neither and it did actually point out a serious situation that is going on right now in the world unfortunately for the real karen people of burma from what i saw in the only real remedy for that actual situation is but unfortunately he is not real so i guess that situation and many like it will probably never get solved but i feel the governments need to step up a gearfinally i just wanna thank stallone for a valiant and refreshing sequel the trailers for this movie alone had me giggling like a schoolgirl and i was so hyped for this film it didnt disappoint but i will say stallone if you got footage of some stealth scenes or anything extra i would buy an extended cut,cruel
now living in thailand joins a group of mercenaries to venture into wartorn burma and rescue a group of christian missionarieswhile this is another sequel that keeps john j as the icon who relies more on a gun to get him out of trouble stallone is on top form as the heavy bulky  out with dont push me and in with the new catchy saying go homecol trautman richard crenna is sorely missed but he still makes a brief from the grave appearance in s dream with this film is theres no developed bad guy in a cinematic sense but there is however a bad army and silent leader which adds to the realistic tone of the filmthe acting is a mixed bag from the supporting cast brian tylers music is fine the locations and sets are fantastic but what stands out is glen macphersons cinematography and sean albertson slick editing sly is on top directing form giving a film that is like a war doc at times and you really see what damage bullets can do like is predecessors there is a message in art monterastellis and stallones screenplay but its sometimes lost in the gunfire and blood its not as smart as the first blood but the ending rounds the film off well and does go home id happily pay to see another made well done mr stallone,cruel
first of all john is kicking ass great action movie the actors in supporting roles are fabulous and the story is fantastic at last there is a movie about the political situation in myanmar and the violent regime the movie shows a big part of the reality without any hollywoodbeautifying but what a lame ending well of course the final shootout in the jungle is what people expect from a new movie but mr bad guy runs away john waits behind the tree and then bam and done therefore minus 1 star and end titles that last 12 minutes and thats why the movie finally got 93 min instead of 81 min thats a little bit poor isnt it so minus 1 more star but all in all surely one of the best action movies in 2008 dont miss it,cruel
im no professional movie reviewercritic but has to be one of the best action flicks ever committed to film people will complain about the acting the story this and that since when does an action movie need great drama or a confusing winding plot what brings to the table is what the action movie genre is supposed to be about which can be summed up in three words find kill repeat this movie has it all constant action huge explosions awesome fire fights gritty insane amounts of over the top violence and the king daddy of all bad asses john the violence level takes excessive and multiplies it by the square root of holy sht im not talking about sick sadistic torturous violence no im talking about arrows through the jaw 50cal to the head violence if watching this movie doesnt take you back to the mid to late 80s the heyday of action movies where names like stallone willis van damme and schwarzenegger ruled the screens check your pulse,cruel
ill start by admitting i am a huge sly fan  but you dont have to be to enjoy this movie the plot is very simple and the action is simply amazing its gory its violent but its also just amazing to watch what i liked most about this movie and the most recent rocky title is that stallone writes directs and stars in a film that entertains i would defy anyone who knocks his age to look and act as good as this guy when theyre 60 years old go see it because youre not likely to see another entry in this seriesoh and one more thing i dont know if the depiction of what goes on in burma is accurate  but if true  its absolutely horrible,cruel
sylvester stallone is and is sylvester stallone i was on the edge of my seat my heart was raising palms were clammy  filled with emotion anger joy and satisfaction when the bad guys got obliterated by the true all time warrior of the big screen is back better meaner angrier powerful explosive and larger than ever before when the bad guys need to be taken out there is only one solution set in the jungle in burma emerges like a biblical figure and swoops down like the archangel gabriel from the heavens to vaporise all that is evil and to bring salvation to the innocent stallone i salute you i bow before you arnold chuck norris and bruce willis eat you heart out cant wait for 5678,cruel
i had qualms about going to see the fourth movie but through word of mouth i decided to go see it and i was not disappointed is one brutally graphic film whose second half made saving private ryans first half hour seem tame body parts explode and limbs fly i cant believe it didnt get a nc17 rating but with movies like hostel and saw still getting r ratings im not surprisedjohn now leads a tame life of catching snakes for a living not far from the burma border where a ruthless military unit is murdering innocent people stays uninvolved in all this until a group of christian aid workers come to him to rent his boat to go into burma and help these innocent people who are being hunted and killed daily at first he doesnt agree but after the persistence of one of the christian aid workers named sarah miller julie benz he takes them upstream and drops them off not long after a man comes to him and asks for his help in saving these christain workers who have been captured by the same ruthless infantry unit who has been killing the burmese people for yearswith the help of a group of mercenaries makes his way back into burma to rescue the workers what follows is some of the most graphic violence ive seen in any movie the good point is that with this latest entry in the series stallone is not a one man killing machine he has assistance and this helped me to suspend any doubts i had about the movie if they had made him a lone soldier who wipes out an entire infantry unit by himself i wouldve scoffed at the ridiculousness of the film stallone did the right thing by making his character more human and less of an indestructible killing machinei still had to suspend some disbelief but with any action film you have to the story is basic there is no deeper meaning here other then how ruthless the world around us really is if you can accept the basic storyline and take as the violent action film that it is you will enjoy the movie it is rather short at slightly over an hour and a half so that also helps with the pace and makes up for some of the slower moments before the real action starts,cruel
i saw this movie last week and was shocked by the graphic violence highly realistic no holds barred vital to proving the point and impressed by the story line overall i think it an excellent movie simply because it does portray what battle is really like and pits two ideologies against each other with a clear winner at the end stallone also has placed focus on the 60yearold problem in burma and he has woven all these things together in an elegant understated manner the mercenaries are shown as rather inept in the beginning and to me provide a bit of comedic relief this movie is extremely intense and is not for the fainthearted or weakstomached but totally worth seeing on a big screen with surround sound i suspect it will not translate as well on anything smaller,cruel
when you hear of certain movie sequels that are being released you know what you are getting into if you plan on seeing it if you see a movie with part of the title being star trek you probably know it involves sciencefiction and the starship enterprise this can be said about films and this one in particular you know youre going to see a lot of action and this one stays true to formit also stays true to form in that the writing and acting arent exactly oscarwinning efforts i think it takes away from the movie somewhat but the action scenes are numerous and they take your mind off of the lackluster writing and line execution at times the action scenes themselves are quite bloody with bullets explosions shrapnel and debris cutting through limbs and other body parts in a very graphic manner the sound effects that accompanied these scenes were decent if not loudunfortunately the action scenes were so engrossing and time consuming that to me the movie felt like it flew by then again you may enjoy movies like thati wont spoil you with any plot details but know that its pretty straightforward and isnt hard to grasp just like our boy john so if you plan on seeing it dont expect a psychological thriller installment of this series because it isnt happening its you know what youre getting into so sit back and enjoy the action710,cruel
i just came from watching this movie and i must say i was left i aweive already seen the good reviews in here and the good score it had but man i wasnt ready for this this is one of the best action movies ever it is so well done so intense and exciting stallone outdone himself on this one he presents an older that on the outside doesnt care about anything anymore and its very well done i was afraid it would have some cheesy factor into it but nothe war scenes are comparable to saving private ryan in all respects they are so greatly done that i cant say it enoughthe photography and filming are also great and oscar material in my opinion no doubtbut more important than all of that i had a great time from the first second of the movie and thats whats all about specially with a title this movie gives you very distinct emotions trough the whole tape believe mei highly recommend this movie to anyone fan or not its that great,cruel
i really had my doubts about this film i went to see it as i like his final rocky film i was not expecting what i sat and watchedis older wiser and just plain tired he wants to be left alone to live his life and try and accept what he is a killing machine a totally over the top killing machinethe thing that i really liked about this film is the way all the clichs are real the interfering white christians the really evil burmese officer the totally out of their depth hired gunsthe violence is really in your face and there is no pandering or pulling the camera at any timego see this film is you are a late thirties male leave the girlfriend wifepartner at home and just enjoy this film for what it is a total in your face kill them all get some johnny ridewelcome home john,cruel
sylvester stallones alter ego john is back in action presumably for the last time this film resembles stallones final goodbye to rocky balboa which was shot in a slow 70s style this one is shot in a fast 80s style however it has the brutality of today images we see on the internet or on news casts every day stallone does not hold back on the graphic details of violence and although does not talk much it sends a clear message the violence is not glorified nor justified its just there part of reality as we have created it over due course and we have to deal with it whether we like it or notfinally john faces the fact who he really is and accepts it the final shot is a nice homage to first blood and it serves as a fitting end to one of hollywoods all time action heroes stallone has paid respect to the character that made him an international superstar for that he deserves all the credit if youre a fan of stallone or of the character this is a must see if you like action movies this one is also recommended if you dont like graphical violence nor stallone or for that matter dont watch it,cruel
now i am not giving it 810 for violence but quite honestly this movie was really freaking violenti mean we have bits of flesh limbs being blown left and right chunks of things dripping mutilation in all its most graphic detailthis is a really violent movie here folksits also a really good movie the reason i say that is because somehow it had the ability to really draw me into this world the acting for all intent and purposes was more minimalistic then anything else stallone and company didnt say much but what was said was very prolific and to the pointmore was being said with a single glance or a look then actually with a wordwhat was great about this film was that it was very much a send off in all actuality it could have been the last 30 minutes of iii so i dont think that it is fair to call it its own movie its more of a prologue showing how john finally makes it full circle and thats what was nice about itfans will most definitely enjoy it as will 14 year old boys of all ages hex even my wife liked it but then again shes really cool too 8p,cruel
hey hes back and back out of hell as we watch the best movie ever no more sleaziness no bs but all best action eversly must be old but he is the best there is and there will be more killings more gorre but all natural true and full of sequences which are true the best movie of the year i would say where in the us we saw first appearance and as moved we saw the afghanistan movie but apart from all burma movie showed reality and true action sly directory skills have grown after the movie of boxing which sucked but this movie rules oscar for best action and set if there is one ta ta tarintino be ware rodriguez as sly is in action,cruel
its been a long time since i have been so surprised with a movie like i was with this i expected it to be cheesy and full of sentiment like so many movies are now its not it is brutal violent and uncompromising but this is to show the horrors which are happening today the direction and acting on this film are great not going to win an oscar but believable performances with direction which shows talent this film is not for the squeamish but i recommend it wholeheartedly its good to see that first blood which in my opinion is a classic has a worthy successor,cruel
i went out to see with low expectations i found the movie entertaining the movie is realistic harsh fast paced and well directed i love the 2 philosophies about die trying or live dieingand everything goes full circle there is a lions and lambs theme we all needs heros who stand up against oppersion the movie defines these themes well john finally goes home at the end of the movie finally faces what must be faces and goes full circle the viewer wonders what would have happened if the altercation in fisrt blood with the sheriff never appeared would the circle been completed sooner 8 out of 10 worth seeing before renting,cruel
i have to admit that my expectations were low before both rocky balboa and the latest string of stallone movies have been mediocre at best but then i went to see rocky and it was apart from the original clearly the best one but still i didnt expect much from this one either i am happy to tell you all i was dead wrong this is by far the best movie in the series and probably one of the best movies in the wargenre ever made not because of a fantastic storyline but hey this is an action flick the action intensity and realism is unparalleled in my opinion you should definitely check this one out be aware though this one is not for the faint hearted,cruel
john is pretty much the same for the series what is rocky balboa for the rocky series incredibly strong return after all these years stallone brings back his character in a way that stays true to the original and redeems the series after the notsogood sequelsthis is one of the best action movies ive ever seen the camera the editing the light the sound  it makes you feel right there you might want to clean the blood and the dirt from your face after you leave the cinema id describe the style of john as mel gibson apocalypto with machine gunsthe movie has simple and realistic plot which also manages to give a message to the audience after i saw the movie i spent hours on the net reading about burma  a country i only knew where to look for on the map i live in bulgaria and really had no idea about the situation there and this movie made me really carethe conflict of the film might be military and political but its also an inner one  a matter of morality and faith the idealism versus the harsh reality you wont change a thing on you own but somebody has to startjohn started i hope others will join,cruel
has changed hes no longer an angry emotional wreck but a cold hard rock who cant help but have a heart to help poor doomed missionaries who think violence is never necessary even in self defensethis was a great movie because we see him get softened up but not to the point of reliving his traumas hes the older and wiser version of the guy from first bloodthis movie opened my eyes to the situation in burma and i am glad to hear that is being passed around as bootlegs to the proponents of democracy there apparently the film is causing trouble for the oppressive murderous raping hellions they call government thereway to go stallone youve lived up to your character by making this movie next time be sure to use more of jerry goldsmiths music and dump brian tyler and give jerry goldsmith a proper screen credit this time,cruel
i have to admit as a diehard first blood fan firstly and a 2  3 fan secondly i really had my apprehentions about 4 how could the character transcend into the 21st century post 911 world we now live in where all sequels and things revisted years later have a more serious surreal adeptation to them its not going to be stallone vs the bad cop or the vc or the cold war russians so all i could think was how will this work out needless to say i was pleasantly surprised that despite all the violence and gore which was integral to the story and incredibly realistic the story is still about what it was in first bloodjohn s inner struggle to come to grips with what he really is and finding his inner soul and worth beyond the killing that he did in the name of his country the most telling line in the entire movie is when he is responding to how he got on that side of the world he says i was drafted in nam i nearly fell out of my chair no where that i can remember does he say he was drafted being such an efficient killer i always assumed he had joined the army the movie was good and im glad to say it worked out much much better than most revisted franchises the ending is kind of a bummer because you know its the last one but then again it had the same feeling of the end of first blood which is perfect because it really is about closure and finality all these years later i dont think it was better than first blood but that is just my opinion i think fb stand alone by itself very well and of course 2 and 3 were not much more than 80s fight fest oportunism at theyre best 4 is definitely for those who like the fb the best but be warned it is brutal im glad that stallone decided to do this movie and bring closure to the character and for the fans as well tom cleveland ohio,cruel
my personal favorite partspoiler when purees this guy from point blank with a 50 cal mounted turret they got it right this time by not trying too hard to give it a story they let the action do the talking when i say this is the bloodiest movie ive ever seen i mean it this violence is not stylized like kill bill or sin city this is highly realistic violence the basic story is similar to first blood part ii sending to rescue some weaklings or whatever and he kills a whole bunch of people on the way believe it or not there is a moral in this one spoiler in the end when the leader of the missionaries bashes that burmese soldiers head in with a rock it shows the total transformation from the beginning when he told that killing is never ok it shows the loss of humanity in war ok i actually just read that in some stallone interview i didnt actually get any moral from this movie except that killing is as easy as breathing heck yea,cruel
this was an awesome movie which was to be expected since stallone always creates really meaningful movies the dialogue and the script of the movie is just excellent its not just an action movie for many people they will get surprised to see such war is actually going on right now and thanks to this movie many people will learn more about itthe movie is really gory and brutal but combat is brutal in reality in most modern action movies today you will hear audience laughing at how brutal it is not in this movie because this is going on right now there is nothing to laugh atalthough john is a fictitious character sylvester stallone reminds me a lot of him since he risked his life when filming this and bringing the truth out there not many knows this i will remember this movie the rest of my life,cruel
im not sure what has inspired stallone more in resurrecting his iconic 80s films the influx of bad hollywood flicks that use fx instead of traditional stunts or the fear of being forgotten as he grows older whatever it may be his latest work shows that he is inspired tapping back into the old school way of making action films which is sorely missed in todays cinema as a character has disassociated himself with america and whatever changes that now affect it basically hes trapped in a time capsule and burma modern day myanmar suffers from the same problem both the cinematic and the real burma have disconnected themselves from the rest of the world because of its brutal regime and have been that way since the 1980s how perfect then that stallone who cowrote chose a land frozen in the same era that spawned that being said this film could have gone wrong in so many ways but stallone has discovered how to resurrect the primal essence of what hardcore action is all about he understands the genre conventions that belong to it the expectations that an audience brings and is able to raise the bar to gory heights what can you do we are a desensitized audience and anything less would have forced the film to join the ranks of mediocre fare such as crank and transporterthat being said the film more than satisfied my expectations its all there blood and gore and explosions and oneliners the blood and gore is outrageous and most of the fights are memorable if you are a fan then you wont be disappointed and if you are an action fan then this is a must see to believe,cruel
back in 2006 sylvester stallone made rocky balboa a film so good it not only washed out the bad taste left by rocky iv and the atrocious rocky v it ranked with the classic first film the praise he received for it was the best marketing sly was gonna get for his announced sequel which takes our shellshocked hero into burma as someone who hated the beyond overthetop sequels vs vietnam really i figured id give it a shot i mean if he could pull rocky out of the stygian failure it was in why not ramo lo and behold sly has made one of the best theater movies ever and unquestionably the best blockbuster to come out in januarythis time stallone gives us the barest of bones plot to set things up which is a welcome relief to the attempted depth of the first two sequels sly takes a group of missionaries into burma then has to go back in to save them when the inevitable occurs is joined by a group of mercenaries hired by the missionaries church to find them soon the rescue mission turns into the war were expecting from john sly uses actual film instead of digitally throwing in severed body parts and blood lending this film the most realistic violence since saving private ryan grindhouse used regular film too but you wouldnt call zombie killing realistic now would you every bloodbath looks all the more grisly following the basic plot setup we never get more than a minute or two without something exploding which is a wise move that detracts from stallones visibly aged body and that blank stoic face that elicits laughter instead of intimidationthe last act of the film is so epic that it pushed 300 out of the way and cemented this film as the best theater experience i have ever had i dont normally cheer at a film its not like the actors can hear you but i was going wild for this film since t has no plot to speak of and most lines are laughably bad i wouldnt call this a masterpiece of film but its certainly one of the most thrilling action films you will ever see,cruel
when i saw the trailer at first i was like uh oh this movie is going to be kind of cheesy i thought first blood was a great movie and the other were kind of lame so i went to go watch this movie and let me tell you guys this movie kicks assis a movie about a group of christian aid people who want to make a difference in burma but they end up getting kidnapped and its up to and a group of mercenaries there is so much action going on in this movie which is awesome and its a great movie from all the other kind of cheesy action flicks this one will stand out for 08 so anyone that wants to see some blood killing and great one liners from john then this is the movie for you 710,cruel
is back i had seen all the previous movies in dvds and i liked them but the new film beats all the previous although too cruel it was interesting and i did not felt bored at all during the film i really enjoyed the flashback john had which could give you an idea about john if someone had not seen any of the previous movieshowever it was a bit tough to see all those heads arms and legs flying during the battles but it boosts your adrenaline for sure when the films ends you want to punch whoever is in front of you all those scenes where representing the hell over vietnam and the nearby areas such as burma during the civil warfinally i liked very much the soundtrack especially the epic main themea film that action lovers over 17 must see,cruel
i got to admit when i watched the first trailer a while ago i had mixed feelings about the movie the original first blood had a great storyline and you rooted from we move 20 years to now and we see a john in the middle of nowhere hunting snakes i understand they were trying to show light on a terrible situation in burma how ever i was a hard stretch for me to go along with it the story line and acting are a 5 out of 10 at best however the graphic and just insane acting scenes make up for thatas i followed the storyline and about halfway into the movie it just seem ed a little to easy for to take out 100s of bad buys with one large gun plowing away into the fields i mean within 20 minutes the whole movie wrapped up and i was left with the feeling of wait thats it if you are going to wrap up a 4 movie series within 91 minutes it just didnt add up to me i expected a little better acting and a longer story7 out of 10  best,cruel
is actually the first film ive seen and it will probably be the last this is an appallingly and sickeningly violent movie pure pornography in fact that exploits the dreadful events that happened in burma in the name of entertainment it may be very well made and the action sequences are certainly very realistic with severed heads and limbs flying every which way but it serves no purpose and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth stallone not only reprises his role as but also cowrote the film and directed as well he should be ashamed of himself,cruel
i guess im more with the critics on this one i didnt care much for this movie because i thought it was mostly pointless its just the same old stuff of arriving and killing everybody its not even until the last part that you even see wipe out a bunch of people im annoyed by the clichs in this movie you see someone trying to get help from and he says he cant make a big difference or something like that theres this odd scene where we see a bunch of flashbacks that looks like trailer fodder that shouldnt be in a moviethere were rumors of a fourth movie made where he would fight osama bin laden this is that fourth movie but he doesnt partake in the war on terror i doubt that if he did the movie would be any better its mostly an excuse to constantly show death and destruction now the fight scenes themselves were actually pretty well done its just that character development is taken away in case of explosions its really no worse than any other big budget action flick ive now seen every movie and its been okay watching them ,cruel
i have 5 things to say1 hour and 15 minutes plus 12 minutes of credits at the end this movie is way too shortsome scenes are just fillers only there to increase the movies length the dream made of scenes from previous movies is one exampleits very gore i think it even beats some gore movies from the 70s or 80s after a few scenes it gets boring to watch so much blood dropping spilling splashing or exploding aroundthere is no plot i like action but i also like a story and some suspense nothing like that in this movieaction scenes are soso they are mostly about using always bigger firearmswe watched it without fun without anticipation without pleasure its better than watching a boring soap or reality show but not by muchif you like stallone and have 75 minutes to waste rent that movie otherwise do something else,cruel
 sylvester stallone is out on his fourth outing in which he turns the bad taiwanese people into hamburger meat because both the good and bad guys want a pretty white woman named sarah julie benz of dexterdirected produced written by and starring sylvester stallone this film is nothing less than a dedication to sly by sly and a big middle finger to everyone else you could pretty much pick any ism involving prejudice you like and it would stick to this film racism and sexism are most prominent benzs character has nothing to do but play hostage or stand by looking worried as slys body count drifts into the hundreds the people of burma shot in taiwan and asians by extension are evil barbarians who cause evil for the heck of it spear people through building posts toss children into fires and rape and steal and torture for no reason and it goes on and on and on as puts it those men wouldve raped her fifty times over and cut your f heads offwow you are so right basically its a short sighted narrow minded world view for the stupid to congregate aroundwe watch grab dangerous snakes by the hand kill people and fish alike with bows and rip mens throats out with his bare hands and massive biceps its not tongue and cheek sly actually believes it and it would be really funny if it werent so often boring also that it comes from such a hypocritical source considering gun control and just about everything else he opens his mouth about violence isnt bad its just all the violence not done by sylvester stallone thats badsome highlights this film contains a claymore explosion that resembles a miniature hydrogen bomb that was hysterical but somewhere deep down sly believes that was true its such a tasteless racist piece of heman chest beating bulls that i can only afford to give a d,cruel
2008plot kills everyoneif you have seen this film or are thinking about seeing it there are several things you should consider1 am i a person who enjoys a vacuous 90 minutes of action 2 do i enjoy a film with virtually no storyline 3 do i like shallow characters acts moments words in a film 4 do i enjoy graphic bloody intense violence and most importantly5 am i a dedicated stallone fan if the answer to all of those is yes or the answer to 5 is yes you will like the filmthis is such a long way away from first blood a classic raw action film because iv is a far fetched outrageous and even morally reprehensible film however it is at times entertaining and it superficially covers and bases itself in parts of the world which are torn apart by violence and the film even manages to show in limited and rushed areas how war has skewed and demoralised john as a man anyway before i sound like an idiot for trying to provide a backbone to this film let me remind you againkills everyonealthough this is easily a 1 or a 2 out of 10 i do give credit to stallone for reintroducing one of his most famous screen characters and incorporating him into the 21st century other than that unfortunately is pretty much a bunch of bullshit310,cruel

making a sequel is not an easy thing to do and maybe as a stand alone this could have been an ok movie but facing the previous movies done even so long ago this one surly doesnt have what it takes 62 year old silvester stalon still gives a good show but it seems as he started out to be a good movie he latter set out to take an afternoon napim not sure on what did they spend the 50 million budget since this movie doesnt even come close to some of the action combination scene in previews movies i cant help but wonder where are the plot twists gone why didnt i worry for any lives  and where oh where is the standoff between an apache fighter helicopter an old russian tank and maybe an unarmed stalon  the only plus which i hope to see in future genre movies is the reallike ultra violent death scenes you just have to see it to believe it its not gore its just freakin realisticyou can watch this movie and even enjoy it  or you can watch one of the previous ones as well  time is money,cruel
the tagline for the latest film the first for twenty years is heroes never die they just reload well thats fairly untrue when it comes to all those john wayne films from the 1960s showing him singlehandedly win either the second world or vietnam war for the allies without reloading  it was propaganda then came first blood part ii another propaganda driven film in which the of the franchise singlehandily defeats communism in vietnam so finally it feels as if the filmmakers have got it right they have got the film right and they have got the tagline right heroes do not die but does indeed reload a shot in which a jeep mounted machine gun has a few dozen more bullets shoved into it is proof of thisbut this fourth edition of isnt so much flawed as it is a failure to elevate itself above a certain level has tackled the redneck cops of a small town the vietcong and the soviets in afghanistan but here a new enemy in the shape of the burmese army awaits him is really a little bit of first blood part ii mixed in with iii but it works since the narrative stays simple and never tries to be anything its clearly not destined to be however this also works against the film any film that has its immediate opening as a series of news reel clips and footage of a humanitarian crisis is clearly trying to say something trying to bring something to our attention how many people even knew burma existed before seeing this film it is here that feels like a dumbed down version of edward zwicks powerful film from last year entitled blood diamond a film that was a rescue mission an action film and a sort of political drama revolving around a humanitarian crisis in a country of the third world  africa or south east asia genocide is genocidehowever i think it would be wrong of me to compare to blood diamond because they seem like two completely different films but are they really the idea behind is simple aid workers are taken by the burmese militia and they have to be rescued it seems strange how the aid workers go in alone with no guns or un backing but when they go missing the best of the best are willing to go in and get them out at the first sign of decent upstanding americans in trouble push the panic button but until then let the burmese militia get away with anything s narrative is relatively simple but then again all of the films use a relatively simple concept put this killing machine amongst the evil and wrongdoers in the world at that current time for the best part as a piece of entertainment works its slick action scenes and stone faced hard bodied hero are the two outstanding attributes of the film with the majority of the film revolving around a sort of will hewont he approach relating to whether will help these aid workers get upstream  it seems the presence of a woman helps persuade him to go and then later on go back again to rescue thembut then again is a clever film and thats something i did not expect the aid workers are all white american and seemingly innocent with michael schulze standing out he has a grudge against any one who kills people even if it means saving his own life but later he will have an epiphany and his ideas will change the message here is that war does that to you echoing what john himself went through in vietnam its interesting to read up on burma as a nation and discover it gained independence from the british empire in 1948 and was part of our commonwealth so here the americans go in and clear up a mess that has developed since our leaving further examples in the film come in the form of the unexploded bomb that we dropped during world war ii in order to smite the japanese who had invaded the country  burma were in our commonwealth and we had to deal with it but not now it seems but the trick here is that the team of mercenaries are not all american like i thought they would be in fact there are two englishmen involvedbut any hint of maturity is slightly shredded when the character of lewis mctavish is represented as a football hooligan whilst the other englishman is a calmer more sedate soldier whose speciality is sniping itself a calm and sedate skill along with this you have an american named diaz gallegos and yet resembles a sikh then there is reese la botz who looks like your more typical american soldier but while does not have the heart and the message blood diamond had it has all the necessary action and decapitation youd expect from the genre people have their insides and throats removed they become instant mush from hmgs and s trusty old knife is out of the holster pining for bad guy flesh whilst its fun to see nameless and faceless bad guy soldiers get their comeuppance after we witness raping of women execution of children and a liquidation of a village thats all has to offer a cheer and a jeer as our testosterone kicks in at the pinnacle of the kill isnt anything great but it quenches any action thirst we may or may not have as it rips through a simple three act structure consisting of maiming gore and gunfire in an hour and a half now thats breakneck speed for you,cruel
i couldnt wait to see this and finally did yesterdayim a big fan of stallone and just cant understand how he accepted this script i watched it with my girlfriend and we were so let downyes the effects were good and the subject matter was shocking but it was just clich after clich and the director just couldnt make it workstallone of course carried the whole movie on his shoulders but that just was not enough im afraidi like to think im fair with giving a review because i know how much work goes into a movie and that of course we all have different tastes but guys and girls give this one a miss and try and forgive stallone for selling out for a huge paycheck making us fork out money to be let downi gave it a five for the subject matter and for stallone being present,cruel
i guess they didnt thought much about the storythe movie is all about great realistic actionit showed how a war field look likehow dirty oppressive and violent it ishow killing and torture can be for fun or to feed an instinctwar can show what is people made of and how different they areit showed in some way that nature of life which war can reflecti found it a good moviei think it could be a lot better if the story was modifiedit wasnt a waste of time at all,cruel
and to think i missed a third cloverfield viewing for this now ill be honest ive never seen a film nor have i see a diehard film i think that these films are cancerous to the film industry because they sacrifice depth for pure titillationive always been curious about however because ive been told that the first film is actually very well done and actually touches upon very heavy hitting issues while also supplying decent action so i figured that maybe this film could do the sameiv starts with news footage covering the genocide in burma it shows a lot of sequences where villages are attacked just because the people who live in it are christians by the time the film is over youll probably see three villages slaughtered down to every last person this was one of the things i liked about it unrelentingly displayed the horrors of what was going on with burmathen we enter the actual part involving these days i guess is a snake herderthis proves that he is brave and lives dangerously and when he is not doing this he shoots fish with arrows to give them to starving poor peopleto prove he is generousit isnt long before a group of christian doctors arrive at s doorstep offering him money in exchange for a boat ride into burma for they want to bring in medical supplies to a villageand it doesnt take much thinking to know what will happen to this village they ask for a chance to make a difference asks them are you brining any weapons with you of course not replies the doctor then youll never change anything so then sara tries asking the mandatory female whos kindness and beauty will not only fuel s motives for talking the group to burma but will also fuel his eventual decent back into burma to save herthe first half of this film gives you the slight distinction that the film may be decent were introduced to a lot of s psychological problems how hes lost faith in humanity how he is still plagued by the demons of his past even in his sleep sara provides a good check to being kind sweet and to a point naive knows that letting her go to burma is a mistake yet he can see it in her eyes that she wants to go more then anythingso takes them there an unexpected event happens on the way then doctors make it to village village gets genocided a bunch of people are randomly killed off and whoops youre watching a movie againsee the problem with stallone as a writer is that hell often like to put events into the script yet really do nothing with them other then that something apparent when he has paulie having one of his first emotional outbreaks in his latest rocky filmstallone will show you the horrors of the genocide in burma but not much else is done or said about it hell tell you about how screwed up is but ultimately hell just throw him back into the action so he can keep his mouth shut instead of complaining about the horrors he has endured the movie suffers an identity crisis because it wants to be deep and it wants to be a balls to the wall action film and because of s confused screenplay its neitherthe acting is prettywho cares stallone isnt a bad actor but hes nothing extraordinary and i wont talk about anyone else because ive already forgotten about half the characters so yeahthe film is gory almost to the point of near hilarity during the final action scene i couldnt help but find myself laughing at how cheesy the deaths were how ridiculous the sequences weretheres an exploding missile involvedwhen it comes to the action youll really have two types of sequences the kind where villagers are getting raped by the burmese soldiers or the kind where the burmese soldiers are getting raped by youll have the village sequences and a few others to tide you overthe saddest thing is that despite all the glaring flaws of what i suspect the other three films before this shared is that they still have a fanbase who will watch it and love it forever so if youve been a fan of films theres nothing stopping you from watching this if youre a fan of intelligent films that challenge you to think about whats going on then maybe you should pick a slightly more intelligent film like queen latifahs mad money i hear she be robbin banks,cruel
ohh man stallone really popped his collar on this one i didnt think that i would be actually walking into the grasp of john this movie puts right up front for the action the weapons and effects are hit right on the head barrett 50 cal rifles can turn you into swiss cheese grenades shred you like a piece of paper i love how the movie gets going it starts with a genocide scene then jumps to a news report about burma then to john its a little rough but its well executed yes the pun was intended i also like the fact that stallone directed this film he was really gutsy with the content of this movie but its the truth and its happening before our eyes hes showing it to us through cinema this movie sets the bar for the next action movie and the next and the next,cruel
ok so i was raised in the 80s and so have heady memories of both  first blood and itself the less said about 3 the better and so i went in to the cinema expecting something fun but not much elsewhat i actually got was something very powerful and on a par with the original movie simply put it was superbfor one thing some of the scenes showing the brutality of the burmese junta over the karen people was so shocking and so well presented that i had tears in my eyes something i was not expecting very brutal and very necessary to give a real background to the film and to what is actually happening right nowof course this is still an action film and in that regard it does not disappoint doing all his own stunts and showing up many people half his age me included i dont care if sly is over 60 and i dont care if the critics want to give him a bit of a bashing he is great in this film such presence without the need to say very muchadded to all this is the wonderful music score by brian tyler is simply wonderful and adds to the powerful background story as well as the action scenes perfectlyin short i loved this film and will be going back to see it againnot to be missedfarren,cruel
i saw this movie yesterday and seeing the high imdb rating i had high hopes the dialogue was flat and predictable there were very few things i found positive about this movie first the war scenes were very realistic sometimes brutal i remember when i was little i had no difficulty watching scenes with violence and blood i must admit however that i had to close my eyes a couple of times it was too much for me to bear second i wanted to see what sylvester stallone can do bruce willis was amazing in die hard 4 and i kind of expected that would revive some old memories and it did in just a few words you wont be surprised you wont be intrigued but for the old times sake you can go and see the movie,cruel
i havent seen the movie yet but cant wait to i plan on going this weekendevery other comment ive read says something about stallones size and how he looks good to be 62 years old he took hgh or human growth hormone to bulk up for this movie thats the reason he looks good at his age that being said i like just about every stallone movie and dont have a problem with this at all just letting every body know that may not have known any word of stallones next big movie anyway im going to see this weekend and from everything ive heard looks pretty damn good but is it really worth this high of a score,cruel
this just flat out stunk stallone must had a hard time remembering his lines the whole twenty but that was not even my problem with the movie my problem is that stallone forgot this is a s have been about mindless action and absurd sequences since the second one he tries to make a serious attempt at revival of the franchise but it falls flat on its face the acting was just plan horrible stallone was good when he had to be but the supporting cast was just plain old bad plus everything in this movie is just way too simple its basically woman is nice to woman gets captured kills everything the gore was the absurd thing about it it was way too realistic for this type of movie they violence should have been more like planet terror this movie could have been much more if he would have just wrote the story about him vs the taliban for betraying him after the third movie no stallone screaming sobbing scenes gets the automatic flunking grade i think people who loved 2 would be more happy seeing something like planet terror,cruel
let me start by saying im a big fan of the earlier films and i love stallone i thought rocky balboa was great and really applauded stallone for how good it was therefore going into this i had similar expectations that stallone would do justice to the story and the character wrong omg i paid 1 for this rental and feel i got ripped off by 1000 one of the worst films i have ever seen now i have no problem with blood and guts and gore if its done well and advances the story nope not here i felt like i was watching a 14 year olds probably the only age that will like this garbage playstation 3 shoot em up game i mean does every character have to have his body parts come apart in blood and his innards splayed all over the place ridiculous and there is no justification for it the cgi while very modern was stiff as a board again like a computer game with a poor graphics card as for storyline stallone couldve gone in so many good directions with this couldve did what he did so well with balboa but instead he gave us a gore fest and oh threw in a tiein scene at the end that was completely cheap and weak the characters were weak the plot was weak the storyline was nonexistent yes we get it theres genocide in burma and its violent halfway into this movie i wanted to rip it out of my dvd player but i kept hoping it would redeem itself nope and to top it off the movie ended at an hour and 20 minutes thank the force i didnt pay 10 for this crap i think i wouldve hopped on a plane flew to california searched out and destroyed stallone i really hope this is the end of this franchise it has been permanently tarnished by this one prior to renting this i was going to buy the dvd fortunately i didnt ill stick with the trilogy and forget this garbage was ever made please people dont waste your time or money and those who say people who dont like this are not fans go read a book geniuses maybe even the first one of these you might learn something,cruel
warning spoilers aheadi saw the graphic international trailer and got really pumped up to see this movie after 4 months of waiting the day arrived and i went to see it i was aware of the topic that the film covered but what i saw in the first half of the movie shocked me big time people getting mutilated for no true reason and the worst part was when they showed the death of childrenvery graphic i might add and i took a look around and saw looks of shock on the audiences faces after that you cant wait for to exact his brand of justice on these  soldiers which he promptly doesoverall good movie i would have given it a higher rating if not for the subject matter,cruel
not since the original first blood has a movie been so moving and important the first film dealt with how veterans were treated when they returned homethe second two films were simply for fun and it often glorified violence i was a preteen when those films came out and i remember kids who thought that it would be so cool to be moving around and mowing people downsylvester stallone decides to take the worlds longest civil war and put it center stage in this riveting film the action is no longer glorified instead it brings us the true horrors of war and stallone wasnt afraid to make the viewer cringe and wince with every bullet fired that met flesh or severed body parts from the victimsin many ways is the most important film of the series and it shouldnt be overlooked nor should it be looked at as a film that glorifies violence simply because of the gore instead its very realistic and in that way it is a very antiviolent film stallone shoves the violence and atrocities in our faces and down our throats any true human being should walk away trembling just a bit and imagine what it must be like for the people of burma to live each day in fear fear of the military showing up to completely annihilate everyone in the village to treat them as less than human to be forced to run across creeks and waterways as a soldier laughingly tosses mines in random places in many ways this isnt fictional its a depiction of what civilians of burma have had to go through every single daythe real tragedy is that nobody gave it a thought the world didnt care enough to get involved as mass genocide was being carried outno this isnt your typical film not in the least and it should be viewed with respect awe and more than a little sadness and yes it should make you cringe from headtotoe at the realities of war and atrocities perpetrated upon the innocent and defenseless hats off to stallone for arguably giving us the most important film of the series,cruel
after nearly 20 less years 19882007 i was a bit skeptical about what to expect from this film sylvester stallone seemed a bit old to be playing the lead role and the character had been on the shelf for so long that his viability in american culture was very much in doubt fortunately though the writersproducers didnt get everything right they pleasantly surprised me by providing a film that is quite enjoyable and worthy of the titlefor a basic plot summary this film explores a much darker side of the john stallone character found in the deepest regions of indochina an emotionally lost and severely conflicted reluctantly agrees safe passage to a group of missionaries bringing supplies to the warravaged region of burma when the peace mission goes awry and the mercenaries are called in feels compelled to once again enter the war zone he has tried for so long to avoidreally the only glaring problem with this film is that the plot is very predictable you know that things will get screwed up somehow and that will be called in to fix the situation so some of the burmeseterritory exposition is a little tedious if you can get past this though it truly is an entertaining filmthe aspect that stands out the most is the brutalness of the entire picture what the film loses in predictability it makes up for with some brutal scenes that will really make you despise the burmese war force the slaughter of women children animals and the complete burning of villages are shown with no detail spared plus it isnt as if the brutality is just being played for bloody special effects either stallone did his research this time and tried to replicate the shock value of civil warfaregenocide and the result are some very shocking sceneswhat really sets this movie apart though is its focus on the john character whereas parts ii  iii of the series were just shootemups this installment actually tries like the original to delve into what makes tick in fact a lot more time the film is only 91 minutes long could have been devoted to the innerworkings of the vietnam vet and it wouldnt have been boringthus if you are at all skeptical about coming back to the franchise after such a long layoff please dispel those notions and see this movie it is easily the best effort in the franchise since the original first blood,cruel
2008 dir sylvester stallone  cast sylvester stallone julie benz paul schulze matthew marsden ken howard more blam blam bang bang pow wow kaboom should this be any surprise should we expect something a tad more ambitious it would certainly help this time out a group of missionaries fail to heed john s warnings about venturing into hostile territory and as a result he must engage in combat because these morons didnt listen sylvester stallone directs and rightly so for he presents back to back action of exploding bodies he was far more successful with rocky balboa which was surprisingly a terrific film it is unfortunate that he couldnt improve on this franchise as he appears tired of taking the back door to the pleasures in life to engage in combat there is nothing new to the role he beats the crap out of some bad guys and he guns down others and we could care less julie benz paul schulze and matthew marsden play total airheads who think they know more than a guy who has spent most of his life brandishing a machine gun perhaps they havent seen the previous films ken howard plays a pastor seeking s help none of this matters as it really boils down to pointless action violence the production is effective but it had more work go into it than the screenplay which itself should have been used as target practice score 3  10,cruel
is with out no doubt is my favorite war movie of all time its a well written story to meis a character that i always cared for another character like him is big boss from metal gear solid both of these characters made me care about themthe movie gives me something i didnt hope for it brings back the stealth action that made first blood a great moviesylvester stallone always makes usme care and feel for the characters example rockyunlike previous movies doesnt talk much instead he gives this cold stare that makes my skin crawland ofcause the main 2 reasons that this is my favorite war movie of all time is that it has stealth action which most new action movies dont have and the final act is just mind blowingliteraryarms fly offlegs fly offheads fly off and gets blown apartit was just beautiful it was one of the best action scenes ever to put on a movie and this movie had ballsjust like sylvester stallone made the sub characters good too we care for them toosylvester stallone can directact and write movies very well and does a great job doing it2008 is an awesome war movie and it is my personal favorite of all time thanks for reading take it easy,cruel
stallones current trend for revisiting his glory years sparked by the success of rocky balboa continues with this unashamed and extremely gory allaction war film i made the mistake of thinking of this as a reboot but this is not the case  this is essentially a remake of first blood  part 2 in which our monotoned killingmachine hero returns to the fray once again i suppose that there must be a market for this sort of stuff or should that read snuff but personally i would have liked a little less entrails and a bit more soul to itstallone who also wrote and directed this movie returns as john a deeply disaffected vietnam veteran who is living under the radar in thailand his simple existence hunting snakes is interrupted by a group of christian aid workers led by michael paul schulze who are all on a mission to wartorn burma and need s boat to get into the country after being persuaded by fellow aid worker sarah julie benz leads them into burma before leaving them there where they are soon taken hostage by the militia led by major tint maung maung khin upon returning is contacted by their pastor ken howard after they fail to return and recovering some of his humanity joins a team of mercenaries also hired to retrieve themi suspect that stallone has been playing mortal kombat in the intervening years between sequels judging by the frankly ridiculous levels of gore in this film really pushes the boundaries in the violence stakes nudging the film away from mainstream action almost towards extreme horror you see in full cgenhanced technicolour throats being ripped out heads being shot clean off bodies being vaporised by landmines and other injuries that beggar belief eventually you kinda feel sullied by such needless carnage and to be honest i had a bitter taste in my mouth by the time the film ended but such is the raison detre of that things like plot and acting take second fiddle to the chaos  stallones expression for example never changes throughout the whole film until he gets his hands on a jeepmounted machine gun and the realisation that he can really start dealing out death makes him yell like a viking going into battleit is as dumb and macho as its director but i guess that most fans will lap up as the best action movie of 2008 and from a technical standpoint i can see where theyre coming from  it looks the business and with genuine news footage opening the movie it gives the movie a grim realism and makes it weirdly plausible but i just wanted it to surprise me and felt like a bloodsoaked train journey unable to deviate from its course of utterly mindless violence stallones insistence that the violence is justified in order to highlight the brutality of burmas military rulers doesnt ring true  i think stallone was just happy to show the amount of violence that he does now my advice is to stick with the original first blood which is smarter more realistic and doesnt feel like a brainless triggerhappy excuse for killing hundreds and i do mean hundreds of anonymous extras,cruel
sylvester stallone directs and stars in this 2008 action sequel that costars julie benz war vet john stallone is living in thailand as a snake collector and boat man he gets visited by a group of missionaries asking him to take them up river to burma so they can help the people refuses their request until their lead doctor sarah benz convinces himhe takes them and theyre captured by a corrupt burmese major and his army and a team of mercenaries attempt to rescue them sly did good with this and i like brian tylers version of the its a long road theme originated by the late great jerry goldsmith i recommend thisbut caution theres a lot of blood  violence,cruel
im still annoyed at how the franchise devolved into cheesy messages egocentric writing and overthetop acting however as an action movie this isnt too bad its well shot and the quality is there it also avoids cheesy action and has hardcore realistic violence in fact its so hardcore it does get a bit ridiculous guns ripping off limbs heads exploding children being thrown into fires stallone is obviously trying to inform us about the goings on in burma but rather than give us an education he instead kills people the films message of violence is also not particularly well handled i get that sometimes violence is the answer but when they start showing everyone killing without a care in the world it descends into anarchy the most enjoyable of the sequels even if just to satisfy a bit of blood lust thank god the dialogue is kept to a minimum,cruel
what a hell is going on with sly we need to put this guy into the asylum right now so this is slys vision of a ideal film blood gore limbs guts hears heads testicles brains nipples teeth skin everything all over the place leatherface would be proud of that collection so sly is highly informed that there are extremely evil and sadistic people in burma and they are merciless animal like they just go like a tornado through the village and rips people like paper dolls this story is dumb and average a group of christian missionaries are heading to burma to help civilians during that hard time of war and stallone is the one who leads them there but you cant keep a good man down he shows that he is nothing different than them who are you man i barely understood him he has that twisted retarded face that simply tries to perform but cant and only because he felt something for the leading lady in the film he helps a group of mercenaries to find them or whats left of them no charismatic cool villains here just a pedophile swine mustache bearing fat dude who is just evil no lines nothing just evil twisted fk just like stallones brain i dont get it so the guy is evil because he is a sadistic killing pedophile dude was t1000 sadistic pedophile no was colonel poldovsky from 2 a sadistic russian pedophile no so thats slys policy just like a real righteous republican the world around us is full of nogodworshiping heathens and they are all pedophiles i highly dont recommend this movie to anyone if you thinking just now that i am a wimp or something but hey i enjoy good action film too but if i want a slaughter ill go to the salughterhouse and watch pigs getting butchered this is sly early vision of expendables a nonsense action well 80s didnt have that much nonsense or that much gore they got balance thats whats important balance but today anything goes,cruel
i watched this movie with very low expectations but its nothing like the previous movies that were a bit worse every timethis is a very good movie on its own and will make you forget that its a sequel to not so good moviesyou dont need to have seen the movies to understand this one but if you do youll understand the character betteri suggest reading the good books at least the first one instead of watching the movies thotheres nothing exceptional about the story but actors are very good and committed the realism of the visuals is outstanding better than most war movies ive seenits cold mature brutal and bloody but its not a cheap action movie where they just trow stupid violence at you for the sake of it its what i would call solid entertainment for serious adultwith all the junk tv and movies we get these days i found it very refreshingin my opinion except for oscar this is by far the best stallones movie you can find,cruel
awesome movie 1 photography is excellent dark atmosphere the beauty of nature is breathtakingly depicted as well as the miserable living conditions of the burma people 2 great acting by stallone with no exaggerations 3 action is unparalleled you will not want to move your eyes away from the screen from beginning to end 4 realism what there is is what you get 5 sensitivity to a global issue ethnic cleansing reminiscent of the suffering of the armenian people 6 one of the best directions i have seen stallone has really surpassed himself with this movie outstanding 7 the score is lovely and brings to the mind powerful memories from the previous films 8 there is violence all over the place and continuously but this is due to the intended realism and is quite justified by the story less violence would simply insult the viewers intelligence,cruel
i really liked this last chapter to a great series john j a merciless special forces green beret ex soldier who seems to get caught in the middle of conflicts which has nothing to do with him yet his results always leaves a mission completed and a mess of bodies left behind in his wake this was a more gory version to his earlier works but never the less small wars expect casualties and in s case that is not too hard to achieve a small christian group goes into burma to help those who do not have medicine or spiritual help to get them through the increasing violence which builds day by day thus takes the group to the small village yet against his warnings still when they disappear by an attack by the local militia a mercenary group is sent in to find them along with the help of who now has a mission to save one woman the use of weapons in this film is top rate using a large calibre gun which can rip through metal and cutting down the local militia like they were celery sticks the effects were good the music excellent and the story was a great ending to his never ending haunting of s mind going home to see his father for the first time since his inception to vietnam,cruel
depending on who you ask is one of the following one of the best action movies in years possibly the best a vile piece of exploitation or an uninteresting pointless dull mediocrity ultimately the film manages to be all of those things at once in the eyes of this viewerthe movie clearly tries to function as social commentary and spends a lot of time doing so in the first half of the film the action scenes consist of soldiers massacring innocent people in incredibly gruesome detail hence its too disturbing too grim too unrelentingly brutal to be any fun the trouble is that the movie doesnt have the intelligence or grace to function as a solid social commentary or political action thriller its too lunkheaded to work on that level and too grim and serious and real to work as escapist action there lies the exploitation element isnt stallone just capitalizing on a very serious and muchignored problem in the world to make money and continue his comeback while the film is sure to make most liberals though not this one vomit repeatedly i do believe its heart is in the right place i do believe stallone thought he was adding substance to the film in a way the franchise probably hasnt had since first bloodah first blood a genuinely enjoyable emotional thriller with barely any violence and as simplistic as it was as a character study it still worked the popculture image of is most certainly not from that film stallone appears to have wanted to return to the roots of s story but again there is far from enough character development here and what there is is merely a rehash of what we know the final scene is quite touching but its not enough is as serious and dark as that film but still wants to be an 80sstyle action film it doesnt work outit takes too long for the film to get to brutally disposing of the bad guys and doesnt earn that right because its not intelligent or wellwritten enough when it does get there it definitely does reward the viewer with unbelievably overthetop action which would satisfy just about anyones bloodlust and stallone is a better director than most give him credit for its ultimately a watchable and entertaining movie but it never comes to terms with its identity crisis from what i hear of the plot for the upcoming fifth film it sounds like something that could work much better than this did,cruel
stallone provides a solid ending to this series the action was intense and graphic but it definitely kept you interested stallone does a superb job of portraying the much older hero who has slowed down a little and has become even more cynical he was in good enough shape and did an excellent job keeping credibility for our hero without trying to be the super hero of 2 or 3 this movie erases any criticism regarding the series being nothing more than an unrealistic action series glorifying war to make a dollar you will walk out of this movie realizing how disgusting war is and can be and that good will and positive thinking is not always enough to make a difference in the world the weakest part of the movie is the acting performance of the main female character but it was not bad enough to ruin the movie stallone wrote an excellent ending for john j that was not expected but makes you believing things will work out for him long term it was a simple ending but extremely effective,cruel
on a hollywood level ive enjoyed all of them but of this foursome you have 23 that were good cheezy popcorn action and then you have 14 that have soul and spirit i really admire mr stallone for returning to the icon of the way he did as an editor to me that dream sequence was perfectin this one he shows us the basic brutality of war and military murder and puts it under a brutal light and john is not by choice a machinegunning war monger he like most of us just wants to be at peacewhy isnt mr stallone directing more films does he have to be in all of them is that the deal he really knows the craft anywaysome would say it is a gorefest sure as is saving private ryan face it s violent mess is a hell of a lot more true i suspect than a tank playing chicken with a helicopter gunship first blood 3if anything it could have been longer the mercenaries were well performed but inevitably onedimensional this is a very different film from what youd expect of the mythos but if you like at all youll love it  if you havent seen it alreadyd,cruel
an action film with a real honesttogod story and characters you care about stallone comes roaring into 2008 to show the cokesniffing lefties how to put together a movie boasting the finest cinematography and the best editing of 2008 the movies 1 hour 20 minute running time shows the emptyheads like peter jackson how its donewhen the film was made and released few americans knew much about the suppressive regime in burma that today is letting their people die rather than accept outside disaster relief the slaughter of civilians including children sometimes made into a funandgames sport by the bermese government might just shock your everyday liberal wimp well boohoo worse the film portrays real ideals of heroism in a way thatll appeal to young viewers imagine the mental anguish to the cutandrun crowdi think this movie got caught up in the squabble when the weinstein company formerly miramax split from disney otherwise the promotion of it would have been better stallone is still strong box office but in any case its now right there in dvd see it no dont wait i mean right now,cruel
the plot drives a few christian samaritans into burma with his boat they get captured he joins a group to rescue themso much so goodthe story is kept simple as we are used to from previous moviesthe movie is a bit different from the rest of the franchise this movie really concentrates on the misery of the people in burma it goes a long way actually to show their suffering in doing that the movie becomes very gory i am actually pretty bloodthirsty when it comes to action movies i really love violence what i saw in this movie though was actually a bit much i did hear before that this movie was pretty violent but nothing could have prepared me for that kind of violence still it does do its job in conveying the misery of the peoplethe movie is also a dramaactually the action part of the movie is mostly concentrated to a big slaughter sequence at the end before that there are only a few short action beats still this is a really good movie if you enjoy violence then this is the right movie for you if only to check out how far people dare to go these days,cruel
as a fan of the series especially first blood i thought this deliveredi liked the use of the original score and the flashbacks to previous films the action is very fastpaced and violent which adapts well to todays mainstream action movies stallones age isnt much of a deterrent to the movies entertainment value however a younger stallone wouldve made more sense in this rolein a lot of ways this was more believable than first blood part 2 because stallone isnt a oneman army in this one the violence and images are also more intense and believablehowever i still prefer the classic first blood as the best in the series due to the superior character development you really root for john when you see how the police abuse him in first blood while in 08 its assumed that you already know the story,cruel
after i saw the new i was kind of hectic wrestling with my mind about the fact i have not seen any of the other movies yet yes that is correct i have never seen first blood first blood part ii  iii a huge chunk of me was mad at myself for this but then i got to thinking and im now half way happy that i took this movie in first because there i would be like most fans writing a review about a sequel and bringing it down simply because it was not as good as the first or second etc this movie has a lot of heart and its very obvious after the first hour its bloody and tends to be somewhat gory too but thats where the realism comes in which is very impressive in my book and ive seen quite a bit in my day some of my favorite horror films are not even close to being this bloody which says something in the matter of using detail story was overall good and personally sylvester stallone was at his best yet as far as acting give this movie a chance it wont disappoint,cruel
i was going to put this one off because well it sounded like a cashgrab i was totally wrong i think it even surpasses first blood on some levels and i know its difficult to improve upon a classici like the idea of adding dirt and grit to projects in an age of digital cleanliness  more actionthriller filmmakers ought to do that is dirty and gritty and bloody and fast and freakin furious i havent written a review here since like forever but i had to for this one  what a gem i didnt like the way the blood was done if not for the sound effects the blood wouldnt be as effective but thats a detail if you like the great action movies of the 80s 90s and 2000s youll have to add this one to your collection and put it on the same shelf as die hard and the road warrior and robocop  because of the insane amount of bloody violence,cruel
i went into this thinking oh another film hours of pointless shooting and terrible acting i came out amazed sly has crafted a film that should and i cant believe im saying thisof given him a nomination for an oscarwhy do i feel that my soul has left me anyways i truly mean it sure theres all the killing and heads flying around but aside that you can see the plight of the burmese people its so wonderfully done that you cannot do anything but enjoy it the acting isnt the best but at least the actors are actually trying go see this movie if you hate action movies trust me youll be surprisedi always said that sly could direct an amazing movie when pigs fly now if youll excuse me i have to genetically combine a pig and a goose,cruel
this is undoubtedly one of the most graphic and  unfortunately  the most realistic modern war movies  that is utterly unashamed to show the real extent of  say  an antipersonnel mines explosion  the effect of the most destructive of sniper weapons on a persons  well  head  the effects of a sudden bombardment of a village with infantry ordnance  not to mention the fully visible penetration of a teens body with a bayonet  that takes its cue directly from mr spielbergs saving private ryan  showing the bestiality and cruelty in less than 90 minutes  doing it completely candidly and following a saying by mr verhoeven when making his starship troopers  this is what happens in the war  and this  and this  john is not for teens women of all ages and walks of life  lovers  goodwishers optimists and naturelovers and  i cannot but ask myself what was going on in mr stallones mind when he was making this military chainsaw  did he absolutely give up on humanity as so nicely encapsulated in one of the best cinematic oneliners  live for nothing or die for something  i hope 5 is ahead soon ,cruel
is nothing short of one of the most blood thirsty movies to hit the cinemas in a while sly has decided he would not only direct but also write this one on his behalf he could have given the plot a little more depthapart from the slightly 2d plot there are some great tag lines in this movie and some terrific acting and sly does perfect as usual the action is very solid even though the movie is super blood thirsty with unbearable gore there is a pulse to the film which stops you from tearing away from the screen which really makes this film powerfulapparently the actions of the burmise soldiers and the killing of villagers is a true and actually happening but this film did seem like they used this true story thing and took it as the perfect excuse to be able to plow as much violence as possible in and get away with iti gave this a 7 and even though i though a lot of the content was too much for an action film the film is superbly made and i think sly did a great job at directing every explosion and shot will make your heart miss a beat because every time its horrific this is a powerful movie but without the good direction acting and horrible gore the plot is too shallow overall i would only recommend to a very selected audience who have very strong stomachs and will not be offended by violence,cruel
twenty years after the last film in the series john sylvester stallone has retreated to northern thailand where hes running a longboat on the salween river on the nearby thaiburma myanmar border the worlds longestrunning civil war the burmesekaren conflict rages into its 60th year but who lives a solitary simple life in the mountains and jungles fishing and catching poisonous snakes to sell has long given up fighting even as medics mercenaries rebels and peace workers pass by on their way to the wartorn regionthat all changes when a group of human rights missionaries search out the american river guide john when sarah julie benz and michael bennett paul schulze approach him they explain that since last years trek to the refugee camps the burmese military has laid landmines along the road making it too dangerous for overland travel they ask to guide them up the salween and drop them off so they can deliver medical supplies and food to the karen tribe after initially refusing to cross into burma takes them dropping off sarah michael and the aid workersless than two weeks later pastor arthur marsh ken howard finds and tells him the aid workers did not return and the embassies have not helped locate them he tells hes mortgaged his home and raised money from his congregation to hire mercenaries to get the missionaries who are being held captive by the burmese army although the united states military trained him to be a lethal super soldier in vietnam decades later s reluctance for violence and conflict are palpable his scars faded yet visible however the lone warrior knows what he must do 1010,cruel
the bestis simply the best starting from first blood part one and till the last part stallone never disappointed me hell of an action hell of a hero i can say hes one of the best action actors ever before seeing i doubted in stallones performance and the only reason was because of his age he did a great job in rocky but you have to say that and rocky except the same actor have a lot of differences between each other while on rocky you have to fight in the ring versus an opponent on you have to fight in the jungle versus an army killing trying to survive trying to save lives and to save yourself and thats what stallone did he gave everything he had so that he could make a big 2008 hit a realistic movie not wasting a minute to get in the action and making in the end understand that he cant give up on his country he cant give up on his people even though this might be the last part of one thing is for sure hes gonna be a legend hes gonna be the unforgettable movie action star hes gonna be everybodys hero watch this movie and you will never regret1010  everything was perfect,cruel
to be honest this is the first of the series that ive seen  and i dont have to see all three to understand the genre and violent grip the movie keeps hold oni saw it a week or so after being released in theaters i decided to see it since it looked good but the first five minutes when the villagers of thailand are brutally murdered from bullets to mines after those five minuted i thought maybe this was a bad idea still still possesses the sweat and muscles to travel all over the country when he agrees to help a group of american christain aid workers who hoped to help villagers  but not knowing what was heading their way the vicious burmanese military and its satanic soldiers and general when gets the news of their capture he teams up with missionaries all foulmouthed and armed to the teethit sounds like an all out war in the jungle but its more than that from gory horrifying fatalities from bullets and a machete to the great explosions is sure to make you bit your fingernails to the end,cruel
it has taken many years of tireless boring repetitive action movies ie 007 movies which have completely gone off the rails of course terminator 3 need i say more iv is something that basically needed to happen for the good of action movie fans to the excess of blood  gusts limbs flying and sheer brutality sylvester stallone to me personally has been on a role lately with rocky balboa now iv so i will give this movie 1010 because it is enjoyable bad ass and completely worth the money although being from the uk and having to go out of my way to see it as the odeon would not show it so please dont waste your money on other pieces of garbage ie meet the spartans and if sly does intend to bring out a 5th instalment then i say bring it on,cruel
this film just knocked me for six i cannot begin to say how good i feel it is as my title says it was like cold water in the face after 20 years in the wildernessthe action heroes in vogue right now carry magic wands and do tepid impersonations of keith richards cgi and pg13 films have done their evil work over the last decade and a half all we get now is vegetables in every sense of the word with no meat well if meat is what you want here its hanging off the bone and bloody its been so long since an action film has paced itself getting to the slambang letting the threat of violence hang in the air once the action does start its sudden and gritty and i dont have to remind myself im watching a film and not playing xboxi cannot recommend this highly enough i fully except its a strong taste not to everyones liking and their view is valid but if you like bad bad guys brutal good guys machine guns explosions blood liquifying torsos well i think you get the point then this bullets got your name on it,cruel
i saw today and i was really praying for it not to be like any other failed vietnamwar sequel those cheap hollywood movies that rely solely on cgi to impress i was surprised and happy and exited and shaken and moved sweating while watching this nice entertainment movie the story is simple and does not have much meaning but stallone made the whole experience an exiting one this time it is not killing the whole country which makes the story better to believe if you want to be entertained watch this movie the score is great the cinematography is nice and the effects are one of the best i have seen in any other war movie no other compares to first blood but i would say this one is the second best worth watching and i will surely add it to my trilogy collection,cruel
i had very low expectations especially after seeing rocky balboa rocky balboa was too unrealistic to take sylvester stallone seriously but after taking the gamble and watching it i am not disappointed this is the type of film that ill never get tired of big guns graphic violence a big knife the classic bow and arrow and awesome oneliners the story was nothing new compared to the other films but the action as always with was all that was necessary most certainly not losing a step from the first three classic films sylvester stallone whos career was certainly dying came back with a defibrillator and boosted it back to where he left off since 1996s daylight i cant wait for his next film hollywood needs to go back to the 80s type of action films ridiculous but awesome,cruel
when a group of doctors on a mission to enter burma for religious and medical reasons they persuade a reluctant john to take them their by boat when they are captured by burmese troops joins a group of mercenaries to go into burma to rescue themstallone as he did with rocky balboa resurrects his other famous character but the results are not as good the script is a bit disjointed cowritten by stallone starts the movie as if hes become a bitter man angry with the world by the end of it we see him returning to his old family home back in the us however we dont see enough in the movie story to suggest how or why his character changed to such an extent there is a dream sequence where there are references to his former commanding officer trautman a brief glimpse of the late richard crenna as trautman is seen from the original ending of first blood which implies going full circle but it doesnt really help with thisthe supporting cast dont really get that much to do julie benz as sarah one of the missionaries is the only one to register the other characters dont really get enough time to be developed despite the actors giving decent performances the bad guy a burmese soldier is also not really developedbut where delivers is in the violent action sequences these scenes are amongst the bloodiest and most violent seen in recent mainstream action movies stallone knows aims this movie not at teens that a lot of major movies aim for but at the adults as a result we get exploding head throats ripped out people blown to pieces stallone deserves credit for not skimping on the violence the last halfhour of the movie is virtually onstop violence and it is very impressive wisely the addition of the mercenaries is a good touch stallone realizes the superheroics that a character like may get away with in the 80s wont work so well these days giving his characters age so having the mercenaries makes sense but like i said they are underwritten it does mean that on occasion himself takes a back seat to the other characters during the actionoverall however i think the movie isnt too bad as said you come to watch a movie like for the action and it delivers its just a pity the writing lets it down,cruel
from the trailers and taking into account stallones age i was expecting this to be a bit of a mess though i was proved wrong once the action started to get going and the film just felt really well done im not without my criticism though theres 3 things i felt stopped it from me giving a 9 or 10 those are run time camera and the fact that stallone isnt really the lone hero type we knew him as once he doesnt really take on a million enemies alone like he did in the previous films he has aid and just doesnt do very much for the first half of the film he just takes some people in a boat he does a little solo after that taking out like 5 guys in the blink of an eye but then he is always with other people and at the end just sits behind a mounted machine gun mowing down people while some american mercenaries pick others off with ak47s then its over when theres action and death this movie is virtually unparalleled the gun kills specially the 50cal sniper and the mounted machine gun are so brutal it really wowd me and that doesnt happen often when i watch an action film the one other thing i was a bit pd off with was the camera at times was very shaky at points id rather have just been able to see what was going on from a steadycam if you love action movies though you love or just want something cool to watch for an hour and 20min dont miss this one810,cruel
i enjoy a good film be it comedy drama thriller etc i appreciate fine camera work and cinematography and i can be found talking loudly and often about the merits of oscar winners what we have here though is to be judged on an entirely different level i grew up with the one man army type of film and still have the guilty pleasure of popping in commando or out for justice into my dvd player from time to time it was then with some enthusiasm that i scampered into the cinema in times square in new york to get a look at stallones latest epic its worth mentioning i had my long suffering wife with me too the film begins and moves along at breakneck pace with some of the most violent and bloody sequences ever committed to film it had me absolutely transfixed from beginning to end and seemed to last about 10 minutes as you can probably gather i loved it i loved to see stallone on screen again especially after the disappointing cheese fest that was rocky balboa for me the action and pace were enough for me to forgive some of the wooden acting and questionable one liners my wife on the other hand was not so complimentry she thought the whole thing ridiculous and sadistic and complained sly looked to old and the whole plot was just daft the fact that sly is 61 and can still pull it off made me enjoy it that much more the films release has been timed just right focusing on some of the awful atrocities being committed in burma just as first blood part 2 caught the mood perfectly in 1985 you are not going to want to see this if you are of a nervous disposition vegiterian squeamish or looking for a film to nominate for an oscar but if you want an edge of the seat thrill ride into hell and back you wont be disappointed when i saw it in the states it had been on general release for three weeks and every seat in the cinema was filled,cruel
i appreciate stallones approach entertain and educate but still i dont think hes the right one to do the latter so theres a civil war going on for 60 years in burma a civil war nobody cares about so here is stallones entertaining wake up call the education of this movie finds its quick end in the simple establishment of the wars existence from then on the movies about killing 240 guys in 20 minutes so i wouldnt stretch the educating element of the movie but thats okay cause after all its a movie not robert freaking redford also i sincerely hope that the military regime of burma is not as evil as stallone pictures them but lets talk about the entertaining part stallone turns out to be a great and modern action director totally getting the essence of todays directing he doesnt glorify the violence he shows how horrible it is which is the greatest difference to part 2 and 3 he gets the action back to reality some call it gory or stupid but it isnt it simply rocks as hell and it points out a problem of international politics without of course going deep,cruel
i expect that critics will slate this film as many would view it as mindless violence however if you like pure action this is probably the best film you will ever see this is the most ridiculously violent action film ever with relentless killing sprees on baddies sly has never been better with his intimidating cold gazes and still looks believably fit enough for the part the movie does an excellent job during the first half of building up the viewers hate for the enemies so that you couldnt be more happy to see them all die horribly in the second half the cheesy dialogue and overthetop levels of violence was actually hilarious but this only made me love it even more it proves that a great film doesnt have to be about good dialogue soulsearching or love plots with neverending gunfire and limbs flying everywhere who cares,cruel
is not only a great action movie but it also a document over todays situation in todays burma the movie is not for the weak of heart bodyparts and blood fly across the screen in the most graphic way you could imagine even kids are killed which have been a lifeold taboo in hollywood and stallone breaks that taboo with the biggest sledgehammer ever but even i understand that the story has been spiced with scenes that looks great on a movie and the script maybe have been stretched a bit but this is what people in burma lives and breath everyday fiction is not always far from the truth stallone is doing a great job in portraying a tired and lonely john that pretty much wants to be left alone what i liked about it as well is the fact that stallone is not trying to let act like he was a 35 year old superathletic killing machine he lets act his age to sum this up if you are only going to see 1 action movie this year you should most definitely see great action with a lot of thoughts,cruel
although richard crenna passed before this movie could be done i would have to say after watching it so many times big fan of he would have been proud of stallones work with this piece its unfortunate we werent able to see sam troutman return in this final chapter of the story nor did we get a chance to see just who r was at the end of the movie the story does definitely evolve showing events that do happen in other places all over the world and its unfortunate that we dont actually have a to save those who get lost in the mix of the horror over there i wonder if stallone left r unrevealed because its a cliff hanger that will leave us wondering forever or if it leaves something to add onto if in the future they want to add another chapter to the legacy i do give this more a 1010 on everything great job stallone,cruel
very different from all the other movies while the other three are as cartoonish as can be this one seems to be trying to educate on the horrors the people of burma are going through more than anything else this results in a rather depressive movie in which the last thing youll be able to say is i had fun my favorite film so far is iii as grissly as some of the deaths were in it the picture was full of hilarious lines and plenty of action halfway through iv one would like to ask stallone to try smiling a little even though it would be completely out of tone with the picture he tried to make all of this doesnt make such a bad a picture its just hard rooting for a hero who seems to be going through a not somiddleage depression,cruel
i hesitated about seeing this movie as who wants to see an old steroid i was talked into it by a friend and we went to the late show tell you what this has been the best action movie ive seen in the past ten years lots of graphics violence and action if you dont see it a second time then your crazy you will miss things the first time and wont catch them until the second like the baby being thrown into the fire i dont want to get into it and ruin the movies for future viewers nothing but bullets ripping bodys exploding and limbs flying go see this before its out of the theater its a must buy for blueray,cruel
if you ask me do you want go to see iv i say nope thanks i just like first blood and was pretty fine when i was young how can i forget that shoulder suture someone insist me finally i saw john and let me say is not iv if you like bloody action this is a must see this movie delivers and update the power of the action films from the 80s you can feel along 95 min the first blood s emotions again is not just gory effects is a blasting burning unstopping and realistic war action and i say from now a new era for the 21 centurys action films nobody can do this better than sly great performance great direction and a plain solid plot a perfect cocktail of violence drama humanity and redemption all done by him and who cares the aging acting is wine improves with timethanks again sly for your inspiration and all the people that was working with you in this masterpiecey hasta la vista john nunca te olvidare1010 for action movie fans just gore for the rest of casualties,cruel
now this is how an action movie should be made going to see this movie was a great experience i went to the midnight show with my girlfriend and two buddies when we arrived there was a big line for the movie and the theater manager was convinced to open a 1215 show the second the credits came on the audience applauded like crazy every great action scene was met with numerous applause and the ending which i thought was a classic ending had the entire audience give a standing ovation as for the negative movie critics and their reviews this is not an oscar movie but who wanted it to be its classic action that got everyone to remember growing up with the other movies i think this one was as good as first blood it also had a realistic feel to itas well as addressing the situation thats happening right now in burma sylvester stallone is kind of like the new york yankees you either love him or hate him but i think this film as well as last years rocky balboa shows that stallone is truly gifted as a writerdirectoractor to direct yourself especially in an action movie is very hard worklike mel gibson in braveheartand i think stallone did a wonderful job with it people are hard on stallone cause maybe he had a few bad movies out there or they think in real life he is slow and talks like rockywhy i dont know its called acting it was a character he playedwhat ever reason i think stallone deserves more respect than what people give him hopefully these two new movies he made can help him get his respect,cruel
one worry i had about this movie would be that stallone would turn it too somber and tame how wrong i was he gets straight to the action and never lets go is an intense and visceral experienceset many years after the previous instalment is now living in a quiet village down the river from burma he collects snakes for a local serpent shophis quiet life is turned upside down when a group of christian aid workers come to him to ask to use his boat he is initially reluctant but eventually agrees they need to get into burma burma is portrayed as a wretched war torn place people are viciously murdered and tortured by the military the aid workers wish to bring food and shelter to the people and to help them escape the savagerythe aid workers are kidnapped and tortured by the military and of course it is up to to save the dayit isnt perfect has very little plot to engage in and what plot it does have is ruined by its predictabilitythe action however is extraordinary stallone serves up an adrenaline rush of gore guns and death runs through the woods plants bombs fires guns and mercilessly killsit is basically the same movie as 2 and 3 except it has one moral message it is about a war soldier coming to terms with what his lifes purpose is to kick ass perhaps thats why i enjoyed it so much,cruel
whenever i go to see his movies on the big screen i never worry of how it will turn out the movie stars sylvester stallone all his other movies were great this one will be too those are always the words that come to my mind when i find out that he is going to star in a movie and ive yet to be disappointed by any of his movies including this one this movie was so intense it had me at the edge of my seat quite a bit throughout the movie the war like atmosphere that the movie has is excellent as is his acting performance he is in great shape for his age and looks a lot younger then he really is i always found that quite amazing the story was very engaging and made the movie a lot better to watch because it wasnt just a senseless shoot em up gore fest with no meaning behind it so that was good the special effects were great also very realistic and very cool the movie does have some disturbing moments but not that bad for the most part anyone who likes movies that involve war should see this movie because it really sets the mood even if youve never seen any of syvester stallones other films there is enough action in to keep you interested and wanting to see it,cruel
i was looking at stallones biography and couldt understand why he hasnt been nominated for any awardsit is said that such movies dont need any acting talent i believe that in case somebody else instead of stallone had those roles and rocky would have failed as movies besides he has shown his acting talents in that film noir but people where stuck to the action hero and couldnt see beyondthe movie is what all the previous were a real action film i cant pretend to be a pseudo cultured person is one of the top films in its genre as are one flew over the coocoos nest taxi driver heavy metal jacket donnie dargo fried green tomatoes and so many other great films some of them are well known and have gained the respect they deserve and some others noti believe stallone should have been nominated and in case you dont like pure action films you shouldnt bother watching this movie,cruel
the last time i wrote a comment about a movie was about rocky balboa and now the hardhitting also starring the 1 actionhero of alltime sly stallone he has come a long way babysince lords of flatbush this movie is very graphic so i dont recommend you take your little ones although when i went to see it on sunday i saw some parents bringing their young onesi guess they couldnt find a babysitter puts an exclamation point on the series i loved the story the action the blood and guts the cast and its finale i went to see it alone and i saw it twice in one day and i applauded many times when took care of the bad guys go see it for the raw action you will not be disappointed,cruel
this movie got really high ratings when it first came out imdb had it at 88 and its fallen a bit since then so even know sly is pushing 60 figuring with the initial ratings and the fact that he still had some gas in the tank i gave it a shotoverall it was pretty good 710 the story was less than original and quite predictable but lets face it you dont go see for the deep storyline the action was good and by far one of the goriest movies id seen in a while im actually surprised it got away with an r rating considering the amount of gore shown the first two movies had no where near the amount of gore this one did so the gore factor imo is what everyone was hyped up about and rightfully sowhere did it fall short well for one the running time was only 93 minutes so figure 85 without the credits but i checked back and both the first two movies were about the same so i guess when weve reached the age where movies tend to be 2 hours all sudden a 90 minute movie seems shortlack of memorable bad guys for an action movie to be truly successful you need bad guys with some clout or flare either scary mean tough intelligent basically some noteworthy qualities to give there character some depth other then slaughtering innocent villagers they were just guys with guns moreover they came across more like idiots with guns who made good canon fodder even the main bad guy didnt have more than a lackluster sinister stareonly other complaint was the lack of a climactic edge consider every movie has a climax and had a great climax  end sequence but the climactic edge is where all hope seems lost the good guys are about to die and you as the viewer are on the edge of your seat now while did attempt to have a brief period like this i wasnt on the edge of my seat because i didnt care about the mercenaries and also just figured was going to swing into action and save the day anyway so while the end sequence was great and gory it kind of lacked that suspenseful moment just before at least for me,cruel
not just for the carnage and mayhem which were brilliantly done but for the bigger context in which this movie is set in the same way hotel rwanda opened many peoples eyes to the genocide in that country calls to light the current and ongoing struggles by the burmese people yes the movie is gory with heads being blown off and limbs flying and there are scenes which are appalling to watch on an emotional level at the same time though to downplay the violence in these scenes for the sake of the squeamish would minimize the urgency of the burmese strugglethe movie also addresses the conflict between peacewar naivetyreality with the contrast between the missionary workers who believe in change and become ensnared in the conflict and the merciless generals who perpetuate the war by indiscriminately murdering the innocentthere was not a moment in the movie when i felt bored and the action scenes were amazing i had to wonder though when i left the theater how many people are really going to get it and think about it beyond the visual spectacle that it is by far this was the best of the series and a must see for fans and the socially conscious alike,cruel
ill admit when i first heard about another in the works i shook my head and laughed while at the same time my inner 15 yearold did a backflip i knew id be there opening weekend how could i not be either it was going to be mindless fun parts i  ii or a horrid train wreck iii either one should be entertainingthankfully its the former was one of the best times ive had at the movies in awhile it helped that the soldout crowd was totally into it  cheering and clapping every time john j went into action it was more than just mass euphoria for the good old days of slys straightforward shootem ups though i always thought stallone was a bythenumbers director but here he proves that he really knows what works on a visceral level this movie has some serious action scenes that deliver the goods with a punchedup in your face intensity call it saving private the film wastes no time setting up the scenario of wellmeaning missionaries in danger and then follows the rescuechase pattern of most other films  once the action starts it gradually escalates to a bloody crescendo i dont know what was louder the 50 caliber that sly blasts away with for a good ten minutes or the cheers of the crowd watching him do itsome may call it dumb but dumb really doesnt do a film that works this well justice simple is a better description but who ever said kiss was a bad thing sign me up for your next campaign sly ill be there,cruel
with a combination of grindhouse style gore and the sickening display of torture and war is back and its easy to lose your head in it goodness knows half the cast did much more violent than the previous films this movie takes violences beyond the necessary limits however due to the nature of the villains you may not feel bad about the extents of the violence bestowed upon them while the story steals a part of the story in blood diamond and i do mean part of it not all of it the violence is turned up beyond measurement if you like going to the movies to see how much violence you can stomach then give this a shot if you get sick from even the little blood go see something else i enjoyed this more than first blood ii and iii and on the same level as first blood the difference is this is a simpler story with much more in the way of gore have fun,cruel
john as the title sequence called this movie is indeed a movie that finally completely proves how violence can be used to preach antiviolence this movie has such realistic gore without ever glorifying it that i had to convince myself while watching it that it is just a movie s insanely calm and coldblooded demeanor while he massacres an entire infantry is reminiscent of how killing so many people has killed him of human emotionssly stallone is indeed a good writer a better writer than a director the movie makes no pretense in sophisticated urbanism it plays out exactly and as simple as expected from s pov this man lives only because he is alive without ever forgetting what he really is his mundane life is interrupted and eventually unhinged due to a simple decision  to help others and only because he can rather than he should the movie is equally linear in its plot and telling yet leaves an impact as powerful as after a saving private ryanin first blood and the two sequels john has fought bigger battles and faced situations of a lot more peril he has run away from what he is or accepted and despised his self but here with age and the maturity it brings he finally comes to peace with who he is and that is where as a personal story this scores well over the first three movieslike for all musclemen stallones physique has taken away any recognition he deserves for the mind he has multiple razzies and stereotypical roles has him always judged as a bigger better version of van damme but with a lot more creative control and less media focus he is finally able to continue what he started of as a nobody in the first rockyoverall this may not the best movie first blood still takes that cake but it surely is the most effective one,cruel
as hardhitting as a sucker punch to the jaw sylvester stallone powerhouses his way back into the modern consciousness with this the fourth in the successful series its been twenty long years since his hero appeared in the cheesy tacky iii and the good news is that stallone has learned a few things by then with the star returning in a dual role as both actor and director it really rests on his rather broad shoulders as to whether this is any cop the good news is that it is some have complained that takes a sideline in this outing but thats not the case john when we meet him is an older wiser more experienced warrior but one who remains just as vicious as he was in the past and viciousness is the key when it comes to because this is one of the most savage films youll ever witnessstallone pulls no punches when depicting the brutal military regime in burma innocents are shot and killed on a routine basis rape and torture are commonplace occurrences and even children and babies arent safe from the soldiers one particular sequence sees a hideous game in which they burmese soldiers innocent villagers to run through boobytrapped paddy fields where they inevitably get blown to shreds of course this violence simmers and burns as the film goes on until the last half sees hitting back and boy does he snap the climax is a visceral ride of revenge and retribution where the bloodshed really goes overboard if you thought the opening of saving private ryan was gruesome you aint seen nothing yet aided by a mercenary buddy with a superpower rifle stallone tears out throats knocks off heads and goes berserk with an antiaircraft gun in his bid to rid the world of these evil soldiers what happens is best left a surprise but ill guarantee that it doesnt disappoint i havent been this pumped at a films climax since i saw hostelof course the directing is perfect and stallones acting is the best yet reaching new levels of subtlety hes supported by a varied bunch of characters including an unlikeable christian a token female a stereotyped cockney and some fun mercenaries the director of photography deserves mention for his excellent camerawork recalling the glory days of the 1980s jungleset war epics but with a grittier more modern edge of course the action is fantastic but whats equally amazing is that the nonaction bits are just as riveting one of those films youll want to watch over and over s a masterpiece of a movie a nonstop thrill ride that never lets up,cruel
hey cant you stop killing people well i mean youve already killed like hundreds of them yeah i know its your right to waste them they are the villains obviously but it is so impossible that so many guns and bigger ones have been fired at you and still a bullet never once touched you yeah maybe only once or twice but still impossible what are you some kind of an immortal creature because i know youre not this isnt a movie about superman but lets appreciate the graphics put unto this movie its so brutally realistic that you cant eat a popcorn while watching those scenes this movie is actionpacked enough to fill the hunger of every psychotic vicious and violent action fans but it lacks a good plot line too quick to start a war and i dont really like the supporting characters too common yeah all the action stuff is fun and entertaining but guys you need to put a little meaning to build at least a good movie this isnt very bad nor good mediocre maybe there are more movies worse than this dont mind searching them,cruel
it took twenty years to get john sylvester stallone back on the screen  slys still in good enough shape to play the part but do we need another film the 80s films were very much products of their time so howd it set into the 21st centuryjohn has retired from all the killing and war games his newly found job as a snake catcher in the thai jungles is interrupted by a group of missionary workers led by sarah julie benz and michael paul schulze who want to hire him and his boat to get them and the medical supplies they carry with them to burma which is in the middle of a brutal civil wargenocide after the missionaries go missing in burma its up to john and a mixed bunch of international mercenaries to go deep in to the hostile grounds and find out whats happened to the aid workers  and bring the survivors home if theres any one leftthe films very brutal theres plenty of gore to pass around and the film doesnt try to hide it in any way the film feasts with blood guts and severed limbs  zooming the action where ever theres the most of blood spilled i havent really seen the things represented here before  shooting of children throwing babies into burning buildings and flames a man shot with a mounted heavy machine gun in close range and blowing up to a mess theres a lot of those kind of moments throughout the film after a while though it starts to feel that the gore and violence is there to cover up the deficiencies of the film  which are plentifulthe script is what i had the most issues with the story is unimaginative and very predictable and has little or if any story building moments in it its just plain killing and fake blood for the most of it the only scene i really enjoyed was the one where decides to go back to his old habits and forges himself a new blade and heads to war the scene though a very short one was well crafted the many action sequences were well shot and edited but not very interesting or holdyourbreath kind of ones its just about getting rid of the nearest enemy and heading for the next some may like it i didnt also the absence of dialog for most of the film and the ridiculously poor quality of it was a surprise stallone knows how to write good stuff but here he has dropped the ball a couple of times the ending didnt make me happy eitherstallone is a good actor in the film he looks like hell but delivers the couple of lines he has nicely matthew marsden school boy does a good job too as a mercenary sniper rest of the guys playing mercenaries though all feel very much out of place you wouldnt believe in a million years that they are hardcore killing machines as suggested here  especially with all the matrixthing theyre pulling constantly off jumping rolling and dodging bullets and knives another after another but its julie benz who stands out from the cast as the weakest link her voice is annoying here and she doesnt seem to put a lot of effort in her performance her character is poorly written ill give her thatis a quite short action marathon with a lot of violence i didnt get what the movie was about and the film was very black and white in the way it presented the situation in burma or in any other third world country in the middle of a civil war the films a blast from the past might have felt a lot more home in the mid 80s or so well see what v has to offer in a couple of years hopefully a good story  something that was absent here 24,cruel
if for no other reason than s rating sitting at 74 with the original first blood is a decent film but in my honest opinion it is a clear notch below first blood sure the production value is a bit higher given stallones financial status but this film squandered a great chance to have john j go out in style this film has as much action as the previous entries and by far uses more gore and cgi than the previous films if i were stallone thinking about this one in preproduction  i would have concentrated on the character his past and what i could do to make this a more emotional and meaningful final chapter needed more lines his place in life needed explanation his heroism needed acknowledgmentfinally and a tiny little bit of a love story might have thrown in a little wrinkle unfortunately i didnt get any of that this is a real cookiecutter action film  unfortunately it offers nothing more about john j the man and doesnt have stand out performances like the originalstallone and dennehy come to mind for me everything just felt a little flat and all the action and gore couldnt save this actingfree action flick with no heart at all not a terrible movie i say even with first blood part 2 a movie that depends on the action and nothing else i wanted something else we had some character development in the first film then they skipped over that point in the sequels  i thought stallone could have really embraced that void here but he didnt he skimmed the surface right when the credits rolled he should have started the film at his parents farm instead of rolling the credits there 54100,cruel
i was expecting more from specially after the competently made rocky balboa unfortunately the film is badly paced and while theres lots of cgi gore theres no character to care for stallone himself looks awful and doesnt do a lot in terms of action the film substitutes incoherent scenes of violence for thrills the depiction of needless child brutality leaves a bad taste in the mouth since this film is clearly meant for entertainment action porn perhaps and it is not a message movie basically its just a gory runofthe mill action flick with the title attached mediocre entertainmentoverall 510,cruel
stallones return as superhero follows the triedandtrue pattern of the generic action film is hiding out in thailand brooding a group of medical missionaries who want to take supplies to rebels in burma ask him to take them upriver of course he says no fortunately theres a hot babe who goes back to talk to him and after she bats her eyelashes at him a few times of course he says yesyou can probably guess what happens next the missionaries are dropped off and before you can say kaboom theyre in trouble and our hero returns to the rescue on the way theres the usual pious missionary claiming that violence is not the answer and of course doesnt see it that way what would be the point of a movie where he sits around and gets in touch with his feelings its all over and done with in about 90 minutes giving action fans a quick fix of the usual there are two distinctive things about this movie however one of the them is an apparently honest attempt by stallone to dramatize the situation in burma myanmar the burmese military are the most repulsive villains you can imagine and from the opening frames youll see a lot of very unpleasant and convincing violence as helpless men women and children are tortured and massacredwhen the battles begin the violence becomes extremely gory to the extent that its almost cartoonish its probably an attempt to be more realistic in action films people usually get shot and obediently fall over here their heads blow off with huge gouts of blood and body parts go flyingfans of the earlier films will probably enjoy this one its an action picture after all not henry iv part i and theres plenty of action but theres really nothing new here its a cookie cutter plot the cinematic equivalent of empty calories,cruel
this latest tale of john is sticky sweet gore candy it seems that sly woke up one day and decided it was time for a carnival of violence that wold make verhoeven stand up salute easily 60 of this movie an a homage to carnage a shining temple to trauma with our man getting gnarly on waves of blood normally reserved for only the most hemorrhage happy anime sure sure there is a message floundering at the bottom of this marianas trench of brutality it amounts to this dont go to burma especially if your an unarmed group of idealistic white folk from colorado outside of that handy little moral the undercurrent of this unabashed slaughter riot is how to make a film into a veritable vessel of viscera there are zero pulled punches in this tale of a horrid civil war men women and children are killed maimed beaten raped tortured and eaten not in a suggestive sense either rent enjoy keep all children under 23 and females out of the room,cruel
if it werent for the violence people wouldnt praise either movie its as simple as that dont overthink it because you know its trueits like the gore in this movie was its gimmick its not a movie with a little gore thrown in this is a gore movie with a tiny sprinkle of thrown in i dont necessarily mind it in fact thats what kept me from falling asleep watching it its the story thats the problemno wonder this movie felt so short how can you base an entire feature film around some guy saving some other guys from a village and thats what this is this is totally devoid of any character development no emotional growth no lessons learned or anything and dont tell me this is based on real life thats an excuse to give this movie more substance than it has this almost feels like some extended flashback sequence shot to be used in some hypothetical future movie and instead of watching the condensed down 5 minute version recounting the events of rescuing some missionaries from a village at which point they go back to telling the main story were seeing the full uncut 90 minute version of it that would explain the lack of emotion in this movie its only a glorified flashbackthoughtsi like the most recent rocky movie gave it an 810 so im not biased against stallonei have zero memory of the original movies so im not biased against a new movie from this franchisei kept thinking the story would take a twist and take us in a different direction at some point i kept thinking it couldnt possibly be this simple theres gotta be more to this story nope what happened was the equivalent of saving zelda from hyrule castle in link to the past and that being the end never even going back to dark worldwas it just me or was this movie unusually short i know its listed at about 90 minutes but i couldve sworn that had looked at his mailbox with a smile and had begun strolling down that road at around the hour and sixteen minute mark,cruel
this movie has it all and more it has the action the awesome explosions followed by the flinging of body parts and blood was super cool the acting was spectacular this movie although great it doesnt beat the first one because the first is not only just as great but it is classic sylvester stallone proved that you are never too old to blow up people up and kick ass it was realistic brutal and i want to watch it over and over again the acting of julie benz was good and very sincere even the annoying minor characters had their own bit of charisma charm and added wonderful things to the movie we have to to have bad guys after all it was an action packed adventure for everyone who has ever liked action movies or has common sense thanks stallone,cruel
i have never seen any of the previous films nor am i a huge fan of stallone however after the latest is definitely one of the best recent actions movies in some time stallone knows what the audience wants when going into a style action film and competently delivers on every aspect but falling into plenty of clichs along the way there is the disgruntled hero called back into service against an army of onedimensionally evil villains there are the ubercool mercenaries and of course the blonde beauty who is basically the centre of the plot thrown into the mix as well is huge amounts of blood entrails exploding heads and bodies and plenty of limbs i see many comments on here complaining about the violence and calling the film disturbed and sick really what does one expect from an r rated flick i went in expecting nonstop action violence and a onedimensional plot and characters and that is what i got for the most part i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it succeeded in its goal of being an adrenalinepacked action extravaganza one major problem i had was the fact you could not hear what stallone was saying he seemed to mumble his whole way through the movieoh well this is recommended for someone who wants 80 minutes of mindless violence and action35,cruel
sylvester stallone is back as john in this bloody actionpacked extravaganza as an action movie it holds its own as the action is unrelentless and entertainingthe movie opens with some disturbing images of a genocidetorn burma during news coverage and those disturbing images dont stop there whatsoever this movie almost got the dreaded nc17 rating but the appeals process to the mpaa gave it an r instead it shows a more realistic war violencethe plot is almost nonexistent but who really cares its an action movie all anybody should expect going into this is to see sylvester stallone kick some butt and that he does anyway a relief group gets captured by the evil burmese army and sets out to free them with a bunch of mercenaries  a good enough excuse for the mindless bloody action as anyactually in all reality i like how this movie just stuck with action instead of trying to make some point or fit the directors political agenda if it had any message at all i guess it would be that genocide is bad well duh also it doesnt try to be funny and fail like armageddon so if youre looking for a good action flick why not give this one a shot you could do much much worse,cruel
this movie is unique on the point of view of hardcore scenes and crueltyi never saw the other sequels of so i cant say if they were like thisbut i enjoy this war moviealso sylvester stallone does a wonderful job writingacting and directing this moviemans a bloody geniusabout the mass murder scenesi never saw something like thisi dont think even the ss armies did something like that to the jewish populationkilling everyone and with a rare crueltyoi wish it had been longer filled with a few more scenesthe way in which it ended its a bit dulli think they could have prolonged it a bitbut its a great war movie,cruel
this movie comes out at a time where there are reports of genocides happening all over the world the opening scenes are the most violent in the whole movie because they are realyou probably already know that is a killing machine that he is a man of few words that he lives by his own moral codes that he wears a red bandanna and that hes a hero well then rejoice action fans s back and he still bears all those qualities the violence is very realistic some times over the top and with a lot of editing this time goes on a mission with a team of mercenaries to save american missionaries that were captured by the bad guys thats about it when it comes to the plot here the bad guys are reaaaally bad aka one dimensional  their day job is ethnic cleansing so you cant expect to fight genocide with flowers this is not for the squeamishwhat i liked about this movie as opposed to the likes of sin city a masterfully done film but with a sick kind of violence that disturbs me is that in showing the massacres you actually get the point these things are real and i suspect they are even worse in real life than they are depicted in this moviethis movie even had me doubting my own morals as i recalled the scene with dr missionary telling that no killing is justified and all persons have a right to live replies saying there some have but some do not and in the end i was agreeing with him thats how powerful this movie isso if youre an action or fan youll be pleased dont expect something like die hard 4 and as weird as this sounds i think this movie is a mustwatch for todays sawhungry generation because at least theres a message behind all the glorified violence,cruel
has caused quite a stir for its strong emphasis on violenceyes it is violent and uncompromising but i dont think you can go to a film and expect anything other than strong intense violencei personally enjoyed the film very muchstallone has matured as a film maker and delivers another fine comeback with this filmits been a while since iii and when this film starts our hero is lost in the world and still struggling with his personal demonsstallone plays the character wellgiving an controlled numb performance before the rage in unleashed in the final thirdive always felt that stallone has been a highly underrated artist and like his rocky character is constantly written off but the last two years have been a thoroughly enjoyable trip down memory lanei advise you to stay away from if you are sensitive to violence but reallyyou should know that already 810,cruel
its hard to have any real expectations of this movie the last movies were bloody war pictures and you have no incentive to expect anything else from this onedespite the sad settings or maybe because of them this movie impressed me it doesnt try to be anything other than it is namely a brutal and vicious war picture the killings are ferocious and is as cool as ever but its not too much as one would expect its a humanitarian depictions of the horrors of war and at the same time a great action flick not perfect but indeed very good an 810 in my book,cruel
does it exactly what it sets out to do after the overly long excesses of there will be blood and no country for old men this is short sharp sweet and to the point stallones directing is surprisingly good with a real talent for timing in a proper cinema the soundtrack and effects are just staggeringly good there are killer one liners and a well judged balanced look at war and its effects  this is not simply an america is great flick there mercenaries are multinationals there is not an american flag in sight and is reticent in his role as the killing machine from hellthis just goes to show that you dont need to be an intellectual or an incredible original indie director who has this idea that no one else seems to get but the world must see involving 27 different plots a tub of vaseline and sign language to fashion a great film,cruel
in terms of authenticity stallone has exceeded everything he has done with this onethe rocky films as excellent as they were were ace because you supported rocky all the way you felt good at the end despite how untrue to life it wasjohn or iv shows the horrors of war the way it is it shares the same ethos as its predecessors as focusing on something that isnt in the limelight this film highlights something that has been going on for many yearsyes its ultraviolent and it pulls no punches thats the purpose is now a more synical and embittered character than the previous filmoverall probably the best action film since terminator 2 must see,cruel
it is a good return but very little more than that it is a sort of meets 28 days later kind of action gory and filthy i was checking the imdbs rating on the original first blood and it averages 72 so i guess this one shouldnt be more than a 60 same as i saw in rocky balboas 6 return last year i did on this as well the main thing is keep fighting which is what most fans of the genre want anyway i guess theres no need to tell the plot it is the same thing as previous ones vietnam afghanistan iraq whichever country were the united states army is invading the plot and are as well if youre a fan should watch it otherwise watch the killing of john lennon,cruel
let the bodies hit the floor this is what did exactly in this movie you can always change something and its always possible beat bad guys up really good which usually makes those other merchenary soldiers looks good as well one of the most remarkable signature that always show in all of its movies silent kill from behindthis movie is excellent filled with actions explosions gunfires blowing up heads and more explosions hes still in his usual self acting cool with few words to spare dont mind the soldier youre definitely not a boring guy to me mate however the movie could have been longer especially with those soldiers development since some of them doesnt like their leader would have been better if theres a bit of confrontation or grudges going on among themselvesbut anyway this movie is definitely worth watching and well deserved 1010,cruel
before going to see this movie i had heard a lot of mixed reviews some of my friend told me that it was amazing and an all out gorefest while i heard from critics that it was awful and just an hour and a half of mindless violencei have always been a fan of sly but i had to admit that 2 and 3 were pretty atrocious but he really revamped himself for this one to be 61 and in such good shape is one thing but to be able to take such a basic plot have hold the audiences attention for 1 12 hours is another triumph completely you cant deny that there is a lot of violence in the movie but i disagree with anyone who says that kill just for the sake of killing every person that he guns down or mutilates in some horrific fashion is an immediate threat to for want of a better word the good guys while the intense rape and massacre scenes are graphic i believe that they are included to give the world a realistic glimpse of what war is really likeim conclusion i came out of the cinema feeling well please with my choice in movie and now sly has done a double with rocky balbo and both turning out as impressive as the originals,cruel
i cant remember the last time i emerged from a cinema with such a big grin on my face this is a great action movie yes its very violent and graphic  not for the squeamish  but of course you have to expect that from a moviethis film has a simple plot with simple characters which allows the story to develop quickly and lets the action begin without too much waiting around  and boy is there action its the same tried and tested formula that has worked in so many hero action movies and i think it still works now the graphic nature of the violent scenes in some ways makes it more realistic showing the true horror of what bullets and explosives will do to the human body but like most films of its genre its also wonderfully farfetched dont try to overanalyse it just sit back and enjoy the show i saw all the previous movies in the 80s and enjoyed them all you dont have to have seen the whole series but i think it helps to know and understand the character john in fact this is the film in which perhaps himself finally accepts who or what he is i love what stallone has done with this movie i thought rocky balboa was a great film too and despite everyone joking about slys age hes still got it my only complaint is that i was enjoying it so much it didnt seem to last long enoughi have no idea why odeon cinemas chose not to show this film despite having advertised it previously ive asked them and they simply state commercial reasons luckily for me my local cineworld had the good sense to show it but there are many people who will miss out on a great film,cruel
there is no doubt about the absolute idiocy of many film critics who on one hand applaud simple one dimensional nonoriginal plagiarized repetitive bloody gory zombie  slasher films and ridiculously non factual so called antiwar films then condemn this series lets face it good old sly was one of those great action heroes who you didnt need to understand when watching this genre its pure war game escapism furthermore it is historically correct that the burmese cambodians the vietnamese and indo chinese do have a propensity to commit horrific and cruel atrocities against their own people in particular the mass torturing and murders of civilians by the pol pot regime there is no doubt that military incursions by the usa into vietnam and the middle east have involved several incidents of atrocities and these have been well exposed however only a complete idiot would brand the usa as worse perpetrators of military atrocities than the indo chinese japanese nazis yugoslavia the middle eastern muslims and many african regimes these countries commit atrocities on a scale that is a mindboggling tragedy and none yes none of these countries make documentaries or films about their dark histories to this day having said that does exploit the atrocities of certain indo chinese countries to establish a worthy opponent for and in this case it is the burmese who are actually murdering torturing and raping civilians on a daily basis as we speak stallone recently pointed out that todays film heroes a little flabby weaklings and that is true for russell crowe orlando bloom and hugh jack man so he went out and remade rocky and this he does look cosmetically tough and stocky but provides his fans of this genre a feast of killing in this story about the rescue of christian missionaries from the viscous burmese military it is a short film with a ridiculous story but at the same time was entertaining with its exploration of body mutilation,cruel
im amazed at this movie but even more amazed by the awesome reviews of it here on imdb first off let me say that ive been a fan since day one if asked my favorite movie of all time you will likely here first blood if not braveheart or gladiator but typically first blood is my answer of course i thought first blood ii was great although not the story driven movie like the first part iii started getting a little out of control on the popcorn movie check your brain at the door in order to enjoy factor but hey it was helping the colonel so i can go with it so here we are however many years later with im kind of pumped for this movie but i brace myself for something terrible wasnt terrible but it was just short of being terrible one of my main complaints is that the character changed so much from the earlier films it went from they drew first blood to some people are just born to kill or whatever it is that he says in this film they even played clips from the other movies but they strung them together in a way to act as if his character has always been about killing with no remorse and it simply isnt so in the past movies it has been about defending himself and not about just being a tough killer who chooses the good team to kill for i wont go into the story much except that tries to protect a group of people who are trying to get aid to people who need it that pretty much covers it so we have problem number one being that they totally changed his character and what he stood for problem two is that stallone now looks like a 60 year old man pumped up on steroids i understands he looks this way becausewellbecause he is a 60 year old man pumped up on steroids i couldnt help but watch and wonder if he didnt do steroids would his face still look as bad as it does anyway he doesnt look ripped like the first films he takes the steven segal route by keeping a big shirt on most of the time likely a good choice next the way this movie is shot seems straight from a b horror flick im sorry but give me a break in a b horror movie i cut it more slack but this is was there a rule by the direct that every person who got hit by a bullet had to have a limb blow off this movie makes the opening scene of saving private ryan look like it was pg kids stuff normally i wouldnt complain but it was done so badly the directing in this was horrible from the beginning to end i wanted to love this movie i really did but now i have to wonder whether i will even add it to my collection i guess i will by default because it is but i pray that they dont make another one unless they turn it into a comedy and fights from a wheelchair against elvis or someone  if you are a fan then check this out at a matine or wait for dvd i certainly wouldnt pay full price maybe my standards are too high and you will love it like some of these other people who loved it i think a 6 ranking is more than generous for this movie,cruel
the 1980s were a time when action stars ruled the dayfrom arnold schwarzeneggers terminator to sylvester stallones three turns as john with jeanclaude van damme steven seagal and chuck norris bringing up the rear it was a time when action scenes and stunts of sometimes amazing scope were staged practically and even the males in the audience could feel perfectly fine affirming their heterosexuality through the image of a shirtless muscled character firing off hundreds of rounds of ammo in a tireless quest to preserve democracy mom and apple piebut since the 80s times have changed icons like schwarzenegger have gotten political on us while the van dammes and seagals have all but fallen off the map or are relegated to directtovideo schlock i havent followed stallones career with much interest outside of the films which made the 2008 coming 20 years after the last filmseem like an interesting curio at the very least who wouldnt want to see if the second most wellknown icon of ampedup 80s action could still cut the mustard as a credible character as directed and cowritten by stallone with art monterastelli this third sequel is ultimately as shallow as it is thrilling and absurd achieving a level of murderous dementia that would leave michael bay slackjawed in astonishment and in a sense this seems like the best type of entertainment to spend an afternoon with in the dead of wintermakes few demands of its audience and while the screenplay is simplistic and free of depth who walks into this kind of film with expectations of a deep meaningful story for what its worth the plot involves looking weathered with age working as a boatman just outside of burma where a fascist military regime is silencing dissent through genocide when a group of missionaries from colorado led by julie benz tvs dexter and paul schulze panic room approach him for a ride into the chaotic area the thoroughly disillusioned refuses fck the world is his conclusion but he later comes around and it doesnt take long before the missionaries reach their destination and are flung into the midst of a warzone later teams up with a group of mercenaries of whom the irony is flatly obvious and stages a rescue mission within a the enemies compound that is by turns frenetic and confusing its raining and takes place at night and the film culminates in a jawdropping third act where stallones own unabashedly genocidal ambitions are brought to bloody life in a prolonged massacre that needs to and should be seen to be believedto his credit stallone the director keeps things moving along quite well the clunky callandresponse exposition scenes are wisely dispatched to the beginning of the film so they dont get in the way later on and the saving private ryan style camera effects actually complement the story and setting quite well while the sometimesunpolished cgi can be a distraction including bullethits that are way too clean and obvious the slick editing covers up any glaring flaws and lends the film a sense of ersatzdocumentary realismas for stallone the actor he spends the film with his now 61year old physique obscured by a baggy shirt and jeans and exemplifies the kind of rageboilingunderstonestoicism that made charles bronsons performances in the death wish series so iconic and memorable sure stallone will never be mistaken for one of cinemas great intellectuals but his performance here fits his established persona quite well and when he gets behind an antiaircraft gun at the very end mowing down a seemingly endless enemy army as limbs fly and heads explode it is a thing of sheer beauty,cruel
as usual movie i am a big fan of stallone but i am bit disappointed after watching this movie world has changed we are creating top notch movie with the help of graphics and all but when you will watch this movie you start believing that you are still in 1980 this movie has unnecessary violence what was not needed good thing is in this move that have shown the actual scenario of barma the country is really under trouble first blood is still top of the chat and 4 is nowhere anyway after all its a stallone flick so stallone fan go for it but dont expect much watching this movie without expectation will be a good fun,cruel
this is a very poor sequel of a sequel of a sequel the story is marginal a pretty standard pile of crap lions gate movie intentional lower case pretty much a pure shock movie violence in every way mostly unnecessary rapes mutilation and over the top action type violence for the high reviewers out there i am blown away and feel you might need professional help this movie never should have been released and especially not r it would be a hard nc17 this is the second worst stallone movie ive seen and i have seen most on top of everything else it is a b movie and not even in the style if you still want to watch this at least do so without any kids reviewed by josh,cruel
the movie is good if all you care for are action but the storyline itself is terrible the stupidity of people going to a wartorn country with absolutely no law whatsoever and thinking bringing some medicine and bible goner make a differnce those people would rather grab a knife and slice your throat open than listen to your western style mumbo jumbo should never bother taking them in the first place and definitely never should try to rescue them idiot should just let them die for those who watch the movie  immortal hope some of you remember the part how king hyperion treat the traitor during the beginning of the movie these dumb moronic ads worker deserve no better i dont have anything against good people but try to find a location that deserve to be rescuenot a place that gonna get yourself killed,cruel
okay after hearing about the new film before it was released in theaters i was siked up about it i even watch the last three flicks on youtubecom in order to get pumped for the fourth installment and after the day finally came to watch for what i thought will be the best action film to date with full anticipation and expectation well the film actually delivers but not much the film was actually good but i expected better and it had a lot of potentials aleast enough from keeping the film from being a complete disappointment and were only a few flaws in the mix first off i was expecting the film to be on the same level  on the same league as the last two films if not higher but apparently its just not there warning spoilers the film puts john in the heart of burma where its been said that the burmese war has been raged on for 60 years the burmese army have abuse their authority gunning down villagers kidnapping their women  children while killing some of them and warned them that they will be consequences of they defy them mostly raping their women and forcing their children to become burmese soldiers i including many have expected john to be put into a different new environment but instead is once again put into an asian jungle but im okay with that burmese army are so ruthless as they are despicable in fact youll hate them so much youll be urging to see kill them all the action was undoubtedly violent and gory at best which was the point of the film the only flaws were the film felt so rush through but above all there was no climatic style battle not even in the end instead you just see using a truck mounted machine gunner most of the time decapitating burmese soldiers and stabbing then slices the burmese leader in the end and that was it we see get into a helicopter vs helicopter battle in the second installment then a helicopter vs military tank in the third installment but in the fourth installment instead of something spectacular we get what was stated earlier personally i hope this isnt the last we see sylvester stallone portraying his role as john but still the film is a great homage to the previous films aleast thats all its good for anyways,cruel
sylvester stallones is a brutally realistic film on the rather untalked about topic of burmese genocide thought this is my favorite film in the franchise there are many crippling flaws to this film that may suggest that the starring actor and director may have been reaching beyond his limitsthe good aspects of this film is the realistic depictions of mass genocide and thirdworld warfare which is mainly due to the sfx and cinematography the climatic finish was done really well in comparison to other recent actions flicks it is also respectable that the film makers chose a topic that is less lampooned than others such as conflicts in the middle easthowever the fatal flaws lay in the cgrade acting and simplistic storyline which seemingly had very little thought into it the film contains no subplots or unforeseen events and hardly differentiates itself from other rescue mission films the casting is also bunk with not a single memorable performance,cruel
5 pages that is what i estimate all the collective dialog in this movie would take up if someone were to write it all down the lack of lines and plot or really anything other than mindless action was alarming and the little bit of dialog that there was consisted of cheesy mantras about what life is and what it means to save a life etc just really eye roll worthy garbage the movie was trying to be all thoughtful and deep and it was laughablethe actual movie is filled with lots of action and gore i couldnt care less that there was a lot of blood and graphic scenes  that is certainly not the reason for my low rating the movie was just pure crap plain and simple the big action sequence at the end that the whole movie lead up to was hysterically bad taking out a million guys  lots of blood blah blah blah been there done that stupidgranted i am not the target audience for mindless action films are not for me but i happened to be with someone who wanted to see the movie so i tagged along big mistake at one point randomly pops up behind a bad guy to surprise him and kick his butt and i burst out laughing and couldnt stopplease tell me this was a parody of a movie and not an actual installment into the franchise lastly stallone is too old to play  he looked washed up and ridiculous110 dont watch unless you like movies with little to no plot or dialog and enjoy cheesy action where the supastar is a senior citizen the high ratings and praise for this movie is baffling it was an utter failure,cruel
i am a die hard fan and am so totally disappointed after watching this film what was the director thinking there was hardly any effort new age cinematography spoiled action classic look of the previous movies there was no need for the mercenaries burma was a waste and the movie was terriblesly was still good cold and strong but somehow he was a sidekick in the movie why was that female crying i still cant understand and why did that brit mercenary hate his job so much whole lot of cribbing and skinny burma soldiers made to look mean and tough which would make any fan laugh considering the baddies in afghan and vietnam i would advice any fan to stick with the first 3 parts and let this one be ,cruel
dont worry ill justify that for those of you who dont know the plot here it is in a nutshell now living in thailand escorts a group of church volunteers into burma to help the karem people constantly murdered and abused by the government when they are captured goes back into action only this time with the help of a group of toughasnails mercenaries i have to warn you this movie is like many of the best recent films extremely violent but not in the traditional graphic gunfights with the occasional stabbing formula uhuh and it certainly doesnt have any reservations towards showing the brutal reality of genocide small children shot bayoneted and burned alive innocent people mowed down by uncaring and indifferent oppressing soldiers it also has no qualms in showing the devastating reality of modern warfare showing exploding bodies sheared off heads and people ripped in twain by heavy caliber weapons in a way not seen since spielbergs masterpiece saving private ryan director stallone apes the directing style as well to great effect stallone can never be criticized again for romanticizing warfare where the previous sequels were gungho commiebashing epics the new one is merely grimy and disgusting the bad guys are just as corrupt and ruthless but the exciting conclusion where they get theirs is less beautified and exotic than the previous two s replaced with a sense of chaos and ugly slaughter but in the end and the audience know it was worth itin conclusion let me tell you that while inspirational uplifting and pushing stallones righteous rage policies in a way the previous s didnt this is not for the squeamish or faint of heart due to its blunt realism and not mere action pornography as so many hack critics put it for everyone else be aware that this might be the best movie of the decade and is stallones best effort since copland ten years ago see it,cruel
this movie has grit tension and passion its much better than the rolypoly rocky we were given not long ago i love how nothing is sanitized regarding the effects of heavy gunfire on the human body i love how the story is based around the actual situation in burma and it is a public service to expose that in america to audiences that may want to refocus their aim away from iraq for a moment and onto areas like burma that need more attention from the west the photography sound editing and direction are all excellent way way superior to the lame indiana jones and the plastic skull whatever thanks stallone its great thanks,cruel
ya know how when someone is wearing a bad toupee everyone seems to know except the person wearing it well hollywood seems to turn the same blindeye to botox cmon people get yourselves some real mirrors or something stallone is barely recognizable from the first movie that said if you like gore this is a feast for the eyes the acting and dialog was so poor and clichd i actually felt somewhat embarrassed for the actors and the story is nothing at all new  stupid misguided people try to make a difference where none can be made peacefully  but the action was awesome and thats why i rented the movie in the first place so if you take it for what its meant to be you wont be disappointed if you expect to see a wellcrafted piece of filmmaking set in a war zone try full metal jacket saving private ryan city of god or a handful of others,cruel
the dvd version i rentedwas 76 minutes long until the end credits comingits clearly visible when mostly the explosions has cgi helpthe story is poor at allthe acting is just following the same qualityalright this film was dynamicbut howthere are some better one liners at the first halfexactly twowhen stallone and julie benz talks under the nighti forgot the secondsorryfinallypersonally agreeand feel like the other negative comments will open your mindand your eyes tooand dont forget to read that news group review articleunder external reviews linkand i also feel like the first moviefirst bloodwasand is the best movieat the moment310,cruel
if you can get past the crappy story and three pages of horrible dialogue you will get to see some serious carnage has done it again with over the top yet completely satisfying deaths if action movies are you thing this film is for you is still walking the same silent bad ass path answering questions with questions or one word answers all of the supporting roles seemed like cheap chinese toys that eventually get moved into the garage never to be seen again but honestly do we even care about any of that what you really want in this movie there is plenty of if your in the mood to see hundreds of people die horrible bloody deaths then will get the job done for you,cruel
after watching john i felt it was offering a very important message and that is war isnt glorious its inhumane i felt that was the real message behind the overused of violence its intent was to shock and awe enough so that the audience would get a real account of what war is and that its not about ideals like fighting for your country or justice himself made the point he killed because it was for himself it was for survival that is what war is survival ideals such as justice or revenge or liberating others these serve no place on a battlefield its only kill or be killed in a way its a very antiwar movie and it showed how the people trying to help did more harm than good how did they help anyone nobody and people died because of these idealism such as justice or spreading democracywar is hell and no one wants peace more than soldiersi am also very disturbed by the comments by individuals who found pleasure from watching the graphic scenes i myself was shocked but also realize its true and its intent is to remind me that right now in iraq and afganistan that soldiers are dying just like how it is depicted on that screen should it not be shocking that a father a brother an uncle is being killed like that as we sit in the theatre watching this is it funny and pleasurable that someone you know is dying just like that no real soldier would find this movie pleasurable and only reinforce the need of peace in the worldpeople who enjoyed themselves from this kind of graphic violence should be ashamed,cruel

i went to this movie not expecting a thing boy was i in for a treat burning carcasses dismemberment and decapitation by bullet what else can you throw into a movie to catch the attention of deranged lunatics raised on violence how about rape torture and the occasional child tossed into a fire the movie depicts just about every atrocity i could imagine i was told prior to viewing the film that the action is as close to war as it gets as the carnage escalated i found myself examining the small theater i was in for an emergency exit i became convinced that i would be witness to or victim of a post traumatic stress disorder ptsd induced outburst by any one of the gray hair mullet adorned movie goers that i shared the theater with luckily i made it through the entire film unscathed and with only a minimal case of ptsd myselfi wouldnt take a woman to this one guys trust me they wont like it this movie is 100 stallonetestosterone kill kill killto sit through this movie again i would have to get pretty liquored up first therefore i give this movie an 8 jagermeister ratingmy jagermeister rating system on a scale from 1 to 10 1 being great movie no substance abuse required 10 being this movie sucks lets get wasted,cruel
i had a feeling this film would be not all great even before i watched it but with all the hype being put on it and apparently lots of violence i knew i should at least try it basically vietnam veteran john sylvester stallone also directing and writing now lives a secluded life in thailand where he spends time catching snakes for entertainment and chauffeurs local people in his small boat even though he wants to avoid trouble trouble finds him a group of christian human rights missionaries led by sarah miller julie benz and michael burnett paul schulze want to rent his boat to go to burma for over 50 year burma has been a war zone where karen peasants and farmers are ruled by the brutal murderous burmese military and they struggle to survive each day eventually agrees to take them up the river and they end up in a raid and most of them taken captive escapes and as youd expect numerous deaths occur in his path most obviously are made by him also starring matthew marsden as school boy graham mctavish as lewis tim kang as enjoo reynaldo gallegos as diaz and jake la botz as reese stallone doesnt have the edge he used to in the three previous films his age obviously is part of this the story and dialogue are really lame too for me the only good reason to see this film is for the high overthetop violence and blood spill from severing limbs with high calibre bullets and the old machete blade thats it okay,cruel
i went to see last night with a friend it was the only option i had at the movie theater since i have already seen almost all of the movies that look promising i am actually surprised for how many people have rated this movie a 10 i just think people who love pointless action movies are the ones that loved this movie and nobody else went to see it by nobody else i mean people who actually look at a movie at a less superficial level well i can tell you that the movie is entertaining and makes 93 minutes look like fifteen but it is hard to take the movie seriously at any point there is only one point of the movie i thought had to be taken seriously but i think it was just placed there to add some plot since the movie itself doesnt really have one the dialogue is the worst thing ever i like action movies a lot but i really dont enjoy stupid ones so i will live my life from now forward following the tagline of the movie that could be created by a kindergarden kid live for nothing die for something,cruel
this movie offers nothing except blood and gore which is dissapointing adn for me weakest movie of franchise,cruel
stallone does a great job both acting and directing this is the best of the entire series  watch it,cruel
this is a great movie very fast pace very well written a lot of action very good acting a lot of fun it is better then the first 3 movies all the movies are good and this is the best one great movie great movie great movie see it see it see it see it see it see it it is a very good movie any who likes action movies should see this it is the only movie i saw in the theater that is because i was to young when other ones came out and the first one came out before i was born all 4 of this movies are some of the best action movie ever and this is the best one see it it is a most see all the movies are most sees,cruel

warning some spoilers ahead read at your own risk first off let me say that first blood is one of my alltime fav films however i always thought in the sequels he shouldve been more violent and the kills more brutal i have seen people who fought in wars and lost limbs due to getting them blown off with a certain type of weapon clearly shows what happens to the human body when a truck mounted heavy machine gun rips through them the result swiss cheeseyou feel a little bit of sadness toward he lives in semiseclusion avoiding violence and still violence finds him he gives you that feeling that the only way he will truly be free from such violence that seems to keep finding him is to die perhaps he feels that toward the end maybe his time will finally be upthe ending however was the only way they could end this franchisehe finally comes full circle in his life and seems to accept it at lastif you have a weak stomach for extreme violenceie kids being killed on screen dont watch this movie,cruel
honestly if you have a name like that youre destined to be a badass and you know what that is what he is in this movie can take out 100 solders in under an hour but what he cant do is have a more engaging storyso this is or should be s last adventure which is great to leave on this note so basically a group of samaritans hire to take them to a village so they can give the people there food and medicine once they get there these solders or lets say the villains show up and destroy the village capture some people kill the rest and leave so how hears about the people he just helped from this guy who has hire mercenaries to save the group of christains so helps and well you can piece together the restso character wise this story is bland and great at the same time so none of the characters are deep in any way but some like the sniper mercenary and are just such badasses you really dont care im happy to see the main villain didnt have some evil plan to take over the world he was just a sadistic evil guy who didnt say a thingthe gore in this is sometimes really bad you can tell it is cg but other times you just sit there thinking wow did that just happened i am happy to see that in a movie a high power gun will rip a guy in half not guy put a hole in him that in some weird way make me happy with the moviei would go into writing but honestly who cares about dialog in a movie at first i was annoyed but then i just said whatever and went with itso overall this is a low buy for me because if you like youll buy it if not then you will never give it a chance,cruel
has been the gold standard for insane violence for a while now its like the soldier of fortune of the movie world for reference the new sof was refused classification in america and banned in australia the new john does not disappoint and through some sort of mpaa voodoo it only got an r ratingimdb keywords for this film include massacre arm ripped off disturbing intestines and responsibility that last one was put in by some concerned parent im surethe movie opens with the brutal destruction of a village by the burmese army that both sets the tone of the movie and builds towards the ultimate thrill of their destruction i cant say ive felt less pity for someone being blown away by a 50mm sniper rifle than in this moviehas slipped into a funk catching snakes and standing in the rain stoically the presence of amateurs paid mercenaries is just the thing to kick him in to high gear and start the river of blood flowingi wont give it all away people die there just ruined the movie but the buildup and conclusion of setting off an old wwii bomb is about the best movie action ive ever seen i didnt know old stallone could move like that any morewhile not an oscar winner delivers plenty of blood and action while making previous attempts at brutality like saving private ryan look like a childrens birthday party,cruel
i went to go see on a bunch of liquor and had a blast this is a movie to see with the boys and intoxicated a humanly possible i loved the original film and this one was a great sequel all that was missing was col kirby rip was ultra violent with great effects even though a lot of the blood was cgi the story wasnt amazing especially the strike team he had with him but thats what made it fun if i were 12 this would be my all time favorite movie the bad guys were really bad and i loved seeing them disemboweled if you love any stallone film then go see this and enjoy the bloodbathrating  bvideogamehollywoodcom,cruel
having had the pleasure and sadness of visiting burma in 1996 and the added honor of a personal audience with the lady this film downplays the brutal regime of the military dictatorshiphaving seen boys carrying ak47sforced laborshake downsthe us wont get involved because there is no strategic importance and china is also our largest trading partner until you realize thisis just another popcorn movie that one soon forgets about after the final credits stallone says darfur isnt as bad as burmathink about that suu kyi is against violencepreferring gandhis passive resistance i would love to join a group of mercenaries and detonate bombs and assassinate generals,cruel
this is one of the most violent movies ive ever seen decapitations limbs being blown off disembowelment countless deaths  probably more than one hundred most die from gunfire but we also see how crossbows knives land mines and bare hands can be used to kill an unexploded wwii bomb also comes in handy there are also some scenes of cruel and sadistic torture this movie not surprisingly is light on plot reluctantly agrees to help a group of christian missionaries travel into burma predictably they get into trouble and comes to the rescue together with a group of mercenaries hired by the missionaries church standing in their way are over 100 burmese soldiers who inevitably end up dead julie benzs acting is terribly wooden and stallones is a man of few words but if you enjoy bloody violent action movies you will enjoy this movie,cruel
not a bad movie if youre in the right mood it belongs along with the die hard series and if youre a bit fed up tired and dont want to think too much just kick back and watch someone else go around doing a lot of shooting and swearing looking fed up too its pretty good if you want good plot fine acting script story twists and philosophical depth i wouldnt bother sounds obvious but its amazing all the one star reviews that complain about the latter missing from a film for gods sakes thats a bit like going to an indian restaurant and moaning about the spicy food mind you after watching about the hundredth body sawn off spewing blood from machine gun fire it got a bit silly to say the least,cruel
why to reuse rather revitalize after 20 years of its last movie  its easy the name has fame the star is still alive and there is no new original writing right now in the first place and when it comes to stallone well the man needed a hit too needed desperately a hitbut maybe there are some circumstances that made the character of john not as a wounded soldier but as a killing machine is so desired in 2008 circumstances that can make not a relic from vietnams swamp of the 1970s or hollywood commercial take on it in the 1980s but a symbol of expatriation new redemption and the necessity of war this movie on so many levels bothered me to the max to begin with it is downright action but poor and without a touch of singularity being a small so usual bmovie about gorilla war and letsrescuethemfromthesavages which was popular in the 1980s through dozens of movies like uncommon valor lets get harry delta force 2 etc stallone as an actor was at his worst except the final scene he delivered such a shaky performance between quivering features and sleepy facethe dialog sounded outwardly deep while its really dumb the climax was so weak stallone as the writer had to solve everything with one crazy cannon over a mountain that briefed the battle to make it so close to the parody in one sequence of hot shots 2 therefore you as a diehard fan of action whatever must leave your seat unsatisfieddeeper matters  the first was  supposedly  antiwar ok the next 2 movies were antiamerica some asians and the soviet union through hell of a war every time so lets not be poetic in the wrong place movies are war movies with no message but to entertain where the main entertainment comes from the equation of one army vs one man army this round maybe discovered that hes a madeinusa monster so stallone refused ideas for this late sequel where in one is a diplomat working in the un having a wife and son being a monster could have made great drama but unfortunately stallone just utilized the side of monster with a message was that bold to be antipeaceat last selected to come back to his home why not from the start  so his wandering soul may find its salvation yet after one unforgettable bloodbath ive never witnessed in a movie before he fought not for victory but for the extermination transforming into a walking genocide look at him at the end wiping up all of burmas soldiers off the earth without even taking internees  he proved this time that being a mad ugly monster aka  is the only way to survive in this crazy world but see whos making it this way its where cant be anything but an american war more than american hero and a tool to make some box office money not a character with any depths so his coming back to home isnt his longlost inner peace the war has become that as the something he would die for and there is no living without itaside from disturbing moral stallone with only 50 million budget in his hand mustve thought what could be done to attract the new generation to his resurrected character and old so80s hero and he found the answer its not the philosophical dilemma or the great action its the mince the man went with his story to the ratedr limit to make whatever he loves of gory ruptures diffused tornoff limbs and inhuman violence or inhuman moviemaking i just cant forget the climactic scene in which fires his devilish cannon devilishly killing  sorry literally shredding  the stereotyped enemies into hundreds of pieces body count  236 finishing off half of hollywood extras along with my stomach  this is sick so sick not the cartoonish violence of the first 3 movies this is rather the nightmare that john himself lived in vietnam with his friend which he told in the end of part 1 so as you see s movie became as evil as war and we  the poor viewers  got to be as psychologically complicated as him i hated this movie its bloody and horrible apparently that became the only way to make profits since there is no fine script or fine budget and for your information out of the 50 million it came up with 47 million profits thats in tinseltown considered a flop so despite all the mince in the world  this was a bad come back not a comebackfinally and burningly live for nothing or die for something  this can be perfect as recruitment propaganda catchline for bringing new american soldiers to fight in iraq yet another pointless dirty vietnam where the real mince is being made otherwise why not living for something as a change ,cruel
in the jungle in a third world country thats all i wanted to know after watching this shootum up fest i mean the hair was just a little too ridiculous since you know sly stalone is over 60 but stalone comes up with a really simple plot to let his character do what he does best in the movie is hired by some church group to drop them off in war torn burma of course the group gets captured when the evil general burns the village they were helping the church hires some missionaries to rescue them and is the boat driver gets involved and leads the mission into the enemy camp to rescue the survivorsthere is a lot of shootings and people stepping on mines in this and apparently all the bullets used are the kind that can tear someone in half real heavy duty stuff and has his usual stare when blowing someone upfinal verdict if you dont care about plot and just want to see some video game like action film then you will probably think this was ok i thought it was ok for what it was a movie that requires no thinking,cruel

waiting a long time for rocky also waited for this film wasnt that much impressive as its predecessors but not bad at all what some people may think if you are a hardcore fan i suggest not to be very much hopeful from this movie because the best performance of an action hero has been given by stallone in his prime years now he is quite old as to be he looks older to be a solo fighter but somehow i was impressed the way he again acted and directed another franchise the thing which is really deplorable is amount of gore kind of violence in the movie that s what i also dont like while as sly s appearance his performance as i still admire that he is still fit and can run a long distance can fight both with weapons and hand to hand can speak and talk in same manner as previous s used to now its time for him to hang his gun like he hanged his gloves off in rocky and look for other kind of characters this is not a must see while ok and some how worthy to watch if a fan you are7510 to me it deserves at least,cruel
i am one of those people who usually thinks that the last movie of a series is probably bad lets not forget indiana jones especially one where the main actor is 62 years old but this movie is actually really good the action was outstanding and i liked how was kind of haunted by the things he did in his earlier days he has a best inside of him thats just dying to get out and it does was super cool im not so sure if there should be a sequel though i think that it was hard enough to pull this one off and i dont know how they could make another one but you know how hollywood is all they want is money and they really believe in the phrase a sucker is born every minute,cruel
before writing anything else i cannot resist a small spoiler ends with the greatest cinematic noshup this side of saving private ryan in which stallone demonstrates that the best place to be in a firefight is behind a 20mm cannon in fact this 20minute piece de resistance is so explosively violent quite literally that the rest of the film pales in comparison i cant even recall what happened before something about missionaries trapped in burma rescue team of exmilitary hard men who cares really the franchise jettisoned the ethos of first blood so long ago that nobody in hollywood remembers what the point was however unjustly became fixed in the popular consciousness as an agent of mindless destruction and vengeance and in the fourth instalment art has clearly imitated life simultaneously setting a new bar for onscreen gorein times gone by the measure of an action movie was in how many blood bags you could stuff under an actors shirt 4 surely has instituted the era of dismemberment so many cgi arms and legs and heads catapult off in every direction followed by great torrents of blood that the only apt comparison i can find is japanese anime in its more bloodthirsty momentsmake no mistake this is a triggerhappy backtobasics shooter in the vein of arnies commando get your grandmother out of the room and tell your girlfriend to close her eyes and for pitys sake dont get on the wrong side of john ,cruel
recap has taken refuge from the world bitter and disappointed deep in the jungle in thailand he is sought out by a group of missionaries who want him to take them by boat into burma to help refugees oppressed by the burmese military when the group themselves become hostages he goes along for the rescue mission as wellcomments violence blood gore the movie can almost be summed up in these three words it is a little unfortunate because there was room for more the movie is not very long as it is now and there are some undeveloped aspects left one is the connection between and sarah there is something there but nothing comes of itnow the story is most of an excuse to show violence with little substance compared to the first movie this is what it lacks because the action is something special it is very direct and doesnt hold anything back if you dont like blood or gore this is clearly not the movie for you because people dies in lots blown to piecesi still hold the original first blood as the best in the series because it actually offers a little substance too this movie is good it had good potential but didnt use it to its fullest good entertainment for action fans though610,cruel
in this fairly unpleasant film stallone makes an illadvised fourth foray into the world of john the first film was great based on david morells excellent novel first blood it was an interesting examination of a man with no place in the society which had turned him into a killing machine it had serious points to make and made them well in the context of an entertaining action thrillerthe second and the third movies had less to offer  they were simply action thrillersthis fourth film purports to be the same thing but is fatally compromised by two things one the story doesnt have much to say there is a setup for missionary michaels all killing is bad viewpoint to be examined after he kills one of the bad soldiers for instance but this never happens and two there is an unsavoury and rather gloating glorification for making death as graphic and grisly as possible there is no character development of any consequence no moral very little story just a great deal of exceedingly violent killingi was neither enamoured nor impressed,cruel
stallones belated return to the story of outcast john manages to deliver all that is expected of it without bothering about any real plot or characterisation of course you dont expect much when you watch a flick like this so nobody will realistically be disappointed even though in terms of filmmaking it is as meaningless as its much hyped catchphrasea grizzled now lives in the jungles of burma earning his living catching snakes as in the other films he has barely a dozen lines of dialogue so we dont really get to know much more about him than we already did he doesnt like people thats for sure but they keep coming to him for help and he keeps allowing himself to be drawn in this time he ferries a group of mercenaries on the trail of a bunch of missionaries kidnapped by the burmese army the mercenaries are stock characters apart from the badtempered exsas commando who is a belligerent cartoonlike bully who earns himself some moody stares from but strangely never feels the heat of his wrath the burmese militia are all to a man drunken rapists and sodomites and therefore thoroughly deserving of the wholesale slaughter meted out by and his palsthe film is all about spectacle and the battle scenes are on a par with those from saving private ryan the film that seems to have become a benchmark for graphically violent battle scenes without really involving the viewer on any emotional level the inception of cgi in the 20 years since s last adventure means that we now see heads legs arms etc disintegrating in bloody showers that splatter the screen and which are sure to thrill all testosteronebloated men under the age of 25 the rest of us will quickly grow inured to the violence and you cant help thinking stallone knows this which might be why the film  minus credits  runs a scant 80 minutesstallone adds an underdeveloped coda to all this carnage with returning home to his father with a smile on his face im not quite sure exactly what inspired either stallone or to do this as a way of bringing the series to an end it is awkward and clumsy and leaves the viewer mystified it would have been better to leave him in that jungle shunned by a civilised society that only calls upon him when it has foul deeds to perform,cruel
if you want to be entertained by some great action sequences gun fights and explosions while not having to think too much i recommend this moviewhen you examine outside the action sequences there really isnt much else the script was overly simplistic and predictableis living in a small village along a river in burma he is making his living by selling snakes he captures to local entertainers seems displeased with his meaningless life a group of aid workers approach and convince to transport them up river to parts of burma that has been devastated by the brutal burmese military warns them repeatedly that they wont change anything he urges them to go home of course almost instantly off his boat they are captured by the military now with a whole different outlook on life feels he must live for nothing or die for something he joins up with a group of mercenaries that have been paid to rescue the captured aid workers they succeed in saving most of the captured looks like they didnt change anything and what did we all learn i struggle to see any true meaning or message in this movie other it striving to entertain audiencesto put it nice and simple is solely an action movie it definitely achieves it objective in that particular aspect but not much else i found all of the action sequences to be really exciting and intense exactly what you hope for in an action movie and boy oh boy were they bloody610 overall,cruel

having watched first blood part 1 part 2 and then part 3 and having enjoyed watching stallone in action i was very keen to watch thisjohn a vietnam war veteran lives a simple life in thailand and makes a living by catching and selling dangerous snakes to the charmers one day  a group of modern day missionaries arrive and ask him to escort them to war torn burma now known as mayanmar initiallly he refuses but after a lot lot of persuassion he agrees later he is informed that the group he took over has not returned and that he has to rake a group of mercenaries to the identical spotstarring sylvester stallone julie benz mathew marsden and graham mctavish this is an all out action movie which is the only movie that has been directed by sly stallone himself not boring at all if you like to watch action movies  this is a must for all sly stallone fansmany had said that sylvester stallone would not be able to make come back into movies well i think he has proved them totally wrong as he has had two movies including this one released this year the first one being rocky balboa conclusion a good movie to watch if you like action and lots of it as well however if you are scared of snakes or anything like that then may be its not such a good idea to keep your eyes open at the beginning,cruel
i have to agree this movie did have a crapload of violence that parents should definitely consider passing up this flick for the sake of their children for the rest of us youll get a big dose of shooting and blood and guts if you treat it for what it is its a very good action flick the storyline is quite weak though since its very predictable whats gonna happen to those missionaries this one is not as quite as good as iii my favorite in the series but gives first blood a run for its money and clearly outperforms first blood ii highly recommended if you have bluray and a decent size plasma or hdtv,cruel
if you are fascinated with guns mutilations and flying body parts this is for you if not its notthere was a lot of high packed action scenes and an overwhelming amount of gore to which there is a very high level of realism something i have not yet experienced before some people may feel offended some nausea i was surprised that i wasnt more appalled i went to see it with some friends we laughed our way through it fascinated with all of the action scenes and to some extent shocked by the abundance in variations over the theme body decompositionas to the acting it was very thin and the dialog thinnerspecifics  in the boat scene with the mercenaries there was a bit of tension but the scene although cut up was too longjulie benz performance especially in the beginning was below average but it gave the scenes a kind of realistic effectthe big explosion effect was particularly good and as mentioned the body parts flying around,cruel
theres no doubt if youre looking for a storyline and a plot that will keep you riveted to your seat and guessing whats going to happen next this is not the movie for you however if you want to see loads of action mindless violence and loads of gore this for you this is without a doubt one of the more graphic war and action movies that ive seen it portrays what i believe a war scene would be like in real life not having been in one and hope never to be forget hitting a landmine and being flung through the air as often happens in many movies this looks life like as bodies disintegrate and are dismembered by the bullets mines knives and all sorts of other weaponsoverall not a bad movie sylvester stallone does what he does best he acts without too many lines being spoken,cruel
hi i just finished watching 4  and i must say this was one solid action movie i remember watching the older movies when i was a kid and i recall nothing except that was a strong tough character and that the movies rocked so i was pretty excited to watch this new movie and i was blown away it had everything action fans wants guns machine guns bullets everywhere gore and blood and of course at his best strong tough full of energy with no mercy so thank you stallone for bringing back i hope they make a 5th movie i would love to see more of in actionim also planning to watch the older movies again so what are you guys waiting for go and see it and buy the dvd when it comes out because this was one of the best action movies in years ,cruel
i found this movie average compared to the other movies sylvester stallone been as john i was really enjoying this movie then all at once it was over with i said whattt come on a bit more storyline could have been in there other than john killing everyone there was more credits at the end of the movie than i thought ten minutes of credits wow so the movie is actually on one hour ten minutes which was really short the acting was not bad from the start but it is similar to one of the computer games just killing if you looked back at the tarzan movies they had a lot of adventure and killings in those movies that is what should have gotten adventure and just not killings all the time you would have thought he would get tired of killing all the time with those muscles you could boil an egg otherall it was not boring so i give it credit for that and i would see the movie but i would not let any children see it because too much blood and gore,cruel
i went to see the movie yesterday with a couple of friends i wasnt surprised that there were no females in the audience this is a 100 guy movieout of nostalgic reasons i have to give it an 8 but the plot and camerawork where not all that great nonetheless i still think its the best movie ever and enjoyed it very muchcompared to the old movies this one contains much more graphic violence the arms and legs are literally flying around but i think it is whats really going on in birma people are being killed for no reason every day stallone made the right choice to give this problem the attention it deservessure stallone is an old man but he can still kick ass,cruel
if youre old enough to remember the films of the 80s this will give you a warm nostalgic inner glow but its much more violent and visceral than the old filmsits fantastic in every sense of that word  best action movie and best comedy of the year the film establishes that the baddies are really bad early  so bad that they deserve to be killed in gruesome ways  thats where comes in no time wasted devising plans  a short scene establishing what sort of characters he is taking along for the ride a grizzly exsas guy and a friendly young sniper then straight to the action  body parts flying everywhere  and you the audience cheering along in spite of yourself while he turns the baddies into lunchmeatnice,cruel
if anyone doubted his acting ability this must surely set them straight the role was perfectly presented and no unrealistic scenes were really present certainly when you consider the age of the actor and the character he portrays stallones last performance in this and the rocky conclusion before it has proved stallones absolute quality as a performer i have watched stallone not only bring to life two quality characters that have spanned generations and created new fans in each decade but i have also witnessed him bring them full circle in their on screen life in masterful performancesthis type of accolade is only reserved for a special few actors that touch us all in different ways like him or hate him this film will rate as once of the greats in hollywood history simply outstanding and a must see for stallone fans and critics alike,cruel
i think that for most of the people from this generation of blood thirsty video gamers will be absolutely loved for the rest of us though its quite hard to follow and over the top most of the way through obviously its an action film and the special effects are great but the emotional bits are cheesy and all of the main characters are introduced too quickly because they were just trying to throw more dead bodies in i just watched the film and i myself was fairly entertained by some of the extreme special effects but tend to prefer a movie with a little bit more dialogue and a little less heads flying in the air my brother however quite easily pleased by all of the action thought it was the best film hed ever seen so maybe it just wasnt for me i gave it a 7 because it was ok just never was going to be a great,cruel
i saw the movie one month later and that because of my concern that it could be just another desperate try of stallones return but thanks god i was completely wrong john is a well acted movie and stallone still is a good performer and he just proved it again no matter his age he still has the instinct of action especially when thats combined with a quite good cast a pretty high budget as about the plot it is a bit short but enough to keep you totally hooked the action is continuously and blood is spread everywhere  when the movie ends you have the felling that you get what you expected to get what else the action of course and a bloody battlefield the only thing i really missed from this movie was the perfect body of stallone many greetings to every one who contributed to this movie,cruel
what can i say just watched john this evening an i was glued to my seat for the entire duration of this classic even after the movie had finished i was held down in my seat with my jaw still open staring at the screen contemplating on what an amazing movie i had just seeni say you can keep all your trash like titanic all your spidermans an most of the other expensive big budget crap that studios churn out every year stallone has shown that the man knows what the people want movies that you actually enjoy and remember which cant be said about most movies nowadays where you forget about the movie as soon as you walk out the cinemathis is the best movie stallone has ever directed and a class ending of the storyin the first three movies the character doesnt want to kill or harm anyone an is pushed into killing here finally accepts who he is an the skills possesses he comes full circle weve never seen this side of in any of the previous movies this is the killing machine that weve all heard about in the previous movies but never saw at his full capabilitythe ending made the hairs on the back of my neck stand uphave to thank sylvester stallone for making a really good movie the movie does not drag for even one second 9510,cruel
this was the greatest action movie ive seen in years sadly they dont make it like this no more sly was great in this movie and if you havent seen him before you would think that hes in his late 30s the story is intense and just right no philosophical point of views and no dragging its a pure action movie just like the many that were produced in the 80s with a brilliant directing from stallone movies dont get any better than this well except for people who enjoy romantic comedies and like to cry all the time this is not for you guys i could keep going on and on about this and i really enjoyed it and it made it up to my top 10 best movies list for all people out there who have doubts about sly and dont hesitate and if you missed it on the big screen buy the dvd dont rent coz this is a must have,cruel
now i bet all of you have been put off by the new and after watching it all i can say is what are these critics on i feel that people are overreacting okay it is violent    very violent but you cant say you havent been warned if it bears an 18 certificate and says contains strong bloody violence personally i thought was quite good it does take a while to get into but once the action begins you dont want it to stop although some scenes are a bit intense one example being a sick game of which civilians are forced to run across a field full of land mines im sure i dont have to draw a picturethe only thing i didnt agree with was a few 30 second clips of children being killed although if youve watched hostel ii youll be fine apart from that me and three other people actually wanted the film to be longer the only reason i could think why this film lost points was because it was full of heavily clichd moments and charactershowever slyvester stallone has still got it as considering the dudes 62 providing us with some memorable oneliners live for nothing or die for something    make the call personally i liked it the violence though intense did appear slightly like you were watching a cartoon in bits but there were some very creative executions im not giving examples    watch it watch this if youre a stallone fan fan into action gore and i mean gore and violence strong bloody violence if you dont like these things dont watch it although clichd has still got it but think before you watch but judge it for yourself not everyone is right even me,cruel
this movie i must say pretty much wraps up the way they should have the movie really brings it all together especially at the end dont get me wrong its a action movie 100 its brutal its cold its absolutely kickass pardon my french the whole time youll be wondering whats he gonna do next where is he gonna go is he gonna die whats he doing now youll never be disappointed in the results that follow i can gauruntee that to sum it all up its pretty much a fast paced brutal action film with some nice get to know yourself things thrown in along to way so if you have seen the first 3 or even if you haventi strongly suggest that you doyou should drop by a theater and witness the concluding end on legend of war himself,cruel
i just want to say thank you sly you are the best action hero and no one will ever be like you thank you for this the character again is great thank you for showing us that this world is no wonderland there are many sick twisted people all over the world and i think people just ignore it and dont do a thing to change the movie is just awesome the pace is great what an adrenalin rush the story is totally believable the missionaries and the mercenaries besides giving credibility to the story they support this is not vs all like some say i hope your movie just like rocky to be a great blockbuster i will buy it when it comes out in dvd god bless you sly your work will not be in vain ten stars   d,cruel
could sly do it again was the question bandied around following the warm critical and commercial reaction to rocky balboa the answer sadly is no where balboa references the original almost constantly in both tone style and meditation on character goes for the jugular80s style stallone has done exactly what the kids of the 80s wantpure unadulterated action on a painful level violence is both condemned and glorified with absolutely no time to stop and consider motivations or reasoning blood spurts forth people explode guns are fired with the actual impact shown alsoall of this action takes place within the final 35 minutes and at times it feels as though thats all youre waiting for with a few decent moments at the beginning the majority is retained for the closing act and here is where the problem is illustratedthis is not a film it is a film with in it apart from a few excellent moments of inspired carnage he plays second fiddle to mercenaries lead by the funniest british stereotype encountered since dick van dyke did a little dance concerning chimneysif you are expecting a book end to the series ala rocky balboa this will disappoint as sly makes zero attempt to justify actions or intentions even the final scene intended as some form of closure fails as it feels tacked on and unbelievable given the characters agebut  and a big but at thatif you are an action fiend this film is pure catnip it will no doubt be a major hit with the teens of today weaned on pg13 terminator and avp filmshere is a movie that is utterly proud of what it is an action movie that works in making you root and at times toot for the good guy,cruel
this is easily one of the best films a great ride from start to finish the action scenes are breathtaking sure the films violent but heck they didnt create the age certificate of 18 or nc17 for no reason stalones acting and directing is on top form which just proves the people who said this oap can not do another are idiots although i can honestly say there is not a bad actor in the film apart from the english sas solider he was annoying us brits are not all like that this is a fitting end to the saga  but hell i want another live for nothing  or die for something,cruel
that is the question whether tis nobler to endure the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune working on a snake farm in northern thailand or dust off thy bandana and kick some burmese glutusmaximus in sore need of being kicked hell yeahhhh is trying to forget his past but people wont leave him alone see some godsquad liberals come knocking on his workshop door they demand to be taken into burma by river  they want him to pilot the boat they wont listen to reason and no sooner are they dropped off than they get themselves kidnappedthen has to pilot a rescue party of multinational renegades to find and extract the hostages the mercs view him with derision  led by a mouthy exsas geek whos expostulations are met with antarctic thousandyard stares from sly the band of hoodlums leave him to guard the boat while they commence the mission these babies soon fall off the potty  but lucky for them arrives with the toilet paperthe movie is great i expected nothing but was hugely entertained the early scenes of burmese villager slaughter are unflinching and highly disturbing dialogue is tauttononexistent but still includes a couple of lines that tarantino would sell kidneys for once sly gets into his helltopay retribution stride  we are treated to pure highoctane ultra violence no one does it like this no stylised slowmo death sequences  just video game justice without any matrix or bourne codphilosophy codswallop its a shootemup that dont pretendthe most memorable scene has sly improvising with an unexploded ww2 bomb he happens to findoh lord  thats gonna hurt in the morning boys of course the critics hate this movie but screw them  who else but sly leaves you with bellylaughs and a huge grin on your face when you come out from a movie these days move aside mr woo get bent mr greengrass its supposed to be entertainment  and delivers  with bells on,cruel
if its action you want well here it is theres nothing at all to tax the intellect just violence on automatic fire pretty much throughout the moviewhich is exactly what most people who choose to see wantif there was a weak spot it was the missionaries what a bunch of muppets while obviously i understand what their role was in the movie and hence why they acted the way they did i couldnt care less about their fate with a bunch of mercenaries called in to rescue them id have left them to it but then im no and it wouldnt have been much of a movie if all he did was putputput up and down the riveranyway i digress great action plenty of machismo blood and exaggerated weapons fire its what is all about,cruel
this is how an action movie should be made brief setup then a nonstop adrenaline rush leading up to a fantastic climax only complaint is that it was too short which in itself is a good complaint for a movie stallone is excellent and his age is never a distraction i remember watching bond films in the 80s with roger moore and sean connery in their fifties they looked ridiculous yet sly is over 60 and never looks out of place does the movie make a meaningful point about the futility of war is it an accurate depiction of the situation in burma i couldnt care less its fantastic entertainment and thats all i want from a movie or any action movie for that matter,cruel
this is probably one of his best films we usually go to cinemas hoping for something and get a little bit of what we hoped for you get it all with i almost jumped out of excitement and it was all i could do to keep me from shouting heck yeah it also provides a moral insight on the great work churches do and the tremendous suffering some people in this world undergoi watched then i went out to the next show room and watched it again believe me it takes a lot to impress me the team work is great i just have no idea why hollywood is incapable of producing such great films all the time and instead rely on the power of advertisement and getting our hopes up this time it definitely worked with them and they produced a top class action it felt like you were right thereenjoy,cruel
this movie is the best movie after the original first blood it has plenty of action that finally after 2 and 3 respects the laws of physics story is simple but engaging bad guy is bad all the way and is of course unstoppable but more in the sense of the first blood and not 2 and 3 the down side is that there is no epic feeling to the story if you dont know who is this becomes just some simple b movie with the high budget but even if you know who is you will remember this movie just as another action rampageso the action is on the spot story could have been better and stallone is in good shape for someone born in 1946,cruel
this is one hell of a movie an action movie for the goreporn set this leaves you floored what a can i say that has not already been said yes this is very very extreame100 action from go to blood soaked end sly has made the best he could and im glad he directed people sometime forget that sly is quit a got film makerhe just doesnt make them for critiquesthe hash location heat that you could neally feel made an impression on me as much as the action solid action from start to finish just a shame we did get a little more depth in the story department flesh out a few characters or something so if you want a taste or whats to come is war films this is the benchmark that has been set be warned war is hell and bullets kill,cruel
after watching the first trailer i got high hopes for this film finally it seemed that sly made a real filmand he did this is by far the best sylvester stallone movie i have ever seen it is brutal it is powerful it had depth and very much soif you are not familiar with burma and the situation there you should spend a few minutes reading up on the subject the fact that they try to educate you with a few seconds of real and painful news footage some as recent as fall 2007 is good but not enough with some insight in the burmese situation you will enjoy this film much moreit is vital to stand alert watch every minor detail closely see the actions is taking here  and everybody else for that matter when the bullets start flying and they do fly so very often in this flick its tough to keep up but necessary stillwhere movies like saving private ryan and hostel tries to justify their violence with plot s violence is the plot nowhere have we seen such an honest film with such a tough central question is it ever justified to kill someone the movie is short it has four characters we learn the names of and only a few minor characters we care about it is minimalistic in every sense  but it is so very well done that we are watching a pure masterpiece herethis is definitely not a film for everyone but everyone should watch it it is an important film and it brings up an important subject it is pure theater pure excitementwhen i go to a movie i want to feel something and this film makes you feel so muchpure excellence1010,cruel
having heard all the hype over the past 23 years that stallone was making another rocky and i didnt think at his age he could pull it off after seeing rocky balboa i was actually quite impressed and now exceeded my expectations i expected this new installment to the series to be the first hour of talking and story build up and then the last 20 minutes to be full on action but as i saw today it was the other way round i was impressed also that there was no cgi and the explosions were all done old school and that it also looked like stallone was doing all his own stunts which was great other than what i have already said was and excellent start to the year but i do hope that stallone doesnt make another or rocky,cruel
war its faaaantastic at least it is if youre a guy with a chip on your shoulder and need something to provein a time of political correctness skewering the joy out of every thing good and wholesome the italian stallion brings to the screen something that eviscerates all the clichd standards of action movies with brutal violence that could give even incumbent housewives vietnam flashbacks there is not a shred of candycoating to tone down the brutality of the subject matternot to glorify the adult content but this movie puts to shame the genre of movies such as sawhostelhills have eyes this isnt stuff that was thought up by some loser with no imagination the brutality captured in this movie is the real violence that affects peoples lives around the world the missionaries that put their lives on the line in the name of hope are the real people who go out there to try and make a difference and the character of john is the soul of every man who yearns to bring justice no matter what the costan inspiring movie for anyone with faith in the hard work that honest men do to bring peace to the few that can appreciate it in the world,cruel
after the trailer i had the feeling this would be the best of the sequels now having just seen the movie itself i cant believe this but 4 challenges even the original first blood  which i have always considered one of my all  time favoriteswhat amazes me the most is the tone how can a movie be both a serious movie with a message and a solid mindless action movie especially when were talking nostalgia trip here with an overaged hero all other nostalgia trips seem to be dodging this and heading for fun action terminator 3 die hard 4 and indy 4 but stallone has a different agenda he wants some serious substance with a fitting tone so just like the character he portrays stallone grinds his teeth and takes on the challenge both of them also take a beating for it critics who seem to be having issues with stallone but both of them will also beat the odds and come out winnersi dare say 4 is not just the best action movie but the best damn movie ive seen in 2 years so mr stallone  thank you for going out there one more time and getting an iconic hero back home the way he deserves,cruel
haha laughed through the movie it was lots of funi cant remember a film that was just gory and i left the theater laughing d so funnynot like an excellent movie but definitely worth going to the moviesi got not much more to sayactually i have to say more since the 10 line rulenote not connected to ive been to myanmar xburma and gotta say that it is one of the poorest places on earth yes they do have a military dictatorship i dont still think that boycotting them will do much good for the people of myanmar i mean most people and our guide was very anti military most regular people live by doing very marvelous craft by hand hope things get better there ,cruel
sly still has it kept me entertained the entire time hate to see the series end at 61 sly still portrays a good action hero very glad i got to see this movie not suitable for young children though it did bother me in some moments of the movie not so much the gore but with the women and children makes you think how lucky we are living where we live instead of the war stricken areas of the world it makes me want to go and watch the old movies now man im gonna hate it when stallone stops making movies the new action heros will never capture an audience like him if you liked any of the old movies you will surely like this one as well,cruel
john or 4 or iv or whatever you want to call it sees mumbling muscle man sly stallone resurrecting his eighties one man army for a final mission the story is simple a group of missionaries get kidnapped by rebels in burma and in his own ultimately cheesy words its better to die for something than live for nothing john decides hes going to get them out cue eighties levels of violence as people are blown up by land mines cut in two by chain guns and generally splattered in all directions and that before has even started if you have seen any of the trilogy commando or anything where the hero takes on an army and creates a blood bath then you will know what to expect the story is scant the acting is bearable and the action is fierce but it is fun none the less maybe not one for the girls or anyone who is a little squeamish but a few beers and a switched off mind and you might just enjoy it,cruel

at first i might just say i did enjoyed the three previous moviesthe first one i think its a very honest action film with a good script and great actingspecially from brian dennehythe second although it seemed a little cheesy in a few momentsa script with patriotic contentbut with great action scenesstallone tried to give a statement about vietnam warbut not so well comprehended by some peoplein the end of the movie s speech wasmisunderstoodduring the reagan erathe third chapter unfortunately didnt do well in its approach showing helping lives in afghanistankilling russians in the end of cold warbut heythe action content in these movies are ultracoolno one can deny that may be a controversial charactermaybe its the reason why its so popular for some people but i definitely liked stallones approach for those moviesthe guy is an actorjust thatthe last chapter i think is as honest as the first chapter in terms of emotionsaction scenesbloody ones with mature content for kidsbut here is the heart of filmgood sly 710,cruel
the trailer leaked months ago promised an ultra violent fortunately stallone delivers the final version was not sanitized this movie is brutal grisly gory violent just as war isin a time when so many americans are enchanted by the idea of eternal war against half of the world this movie makes us pause it shows the brutality of dictatorship but the solution is hardly any more ethical or cleanstallone does a great job as the director and actor here he looks strong and menacing somewhat like a horror icon jason from friday the 13th comes to mind as stallone wields his machete and indeed after years of peaceful existence minding his own business comes to peace with the beast inside and goes absolutely berserk behind a machine gunim deducting a point for the miscast mercenaries what a silly bunch of course you have the obligatory britsaussies who seem to have invaded hollywood also theres less of the ingenious we saw in previous moviesyou will detest the bad guy cheer for the good guys and recoil at the sight of the carnage stallone has really outdone himself with this installment in a time where the only action hero allowed by hollywood is the 60 pound anorexic model seeing a true guys action movie is a welcome return to normalcy physical confrontation is mens business despite the glamorization of girlie power in alias sarah connor resident evil etcdont miss one of the best action movies in a long time,cruel
stallone returns to the type of movie were he became famous in this fourth installment of provides the viewer all the elements of the old movies only with much more violence rrated worthy and better sfx although the story was kept a little bit simple the actors did not always play as good as they should i liked the movie apart of the real life images at the beginning of the movie this is brainless entertainment you can compare it with a thrilling rollercoaster of 90 minutes  it will never win awards but the box office will love him respect for stallone he did not only appear as the principal character but was also the director and wrote the story everybody thought his career was over but with his two last movies rocky and he showed the world that hollywood hasnt forgotten him,cruel
i thought stallone did a great job his physical appearance is amazing for his age as for the movie it had me pretty fired up at one point during the film my hands and arms were getting numb in anticipation of the next scene this is a total testosterone flick and really gets the blood moving if you are unable to view blood and destructioni suggest you pass on the film the only negative i had which is why i gave it a 9 was i felt it was a little too short it kind of left me wanting more not sure if that is what was intended by stallone though in any case go see it i felt overall it was worth the 8 bucks went to an afternoon showing though plus if you are a stallone fan the price and time is worth it,cruel
the fundamental thing about all films is the amount of violence whilst throughout this film the violence is spectacularthe last half an hour in particular however it seems to me that this film failed to break any boundaries by taking a very linear plot line iv seemed to not venture further than a typical action movie plot however this did not seem to hinder the watchability of the film in anyway meaning that the intense action scenes and aweinspiring strength of john certainly provided a hard knuckle busting filmdefinitely worth a watch if you are up for some violence but perhaps too clich to rate too highly,cruel
i dont think this movie is for the weak at heart for those who dont like bloody movies but everyone else this is great this has some awesome action scenes if you want to see someone get blown apart by a big gun then this is the movie for you like any other movie you do have an occasional part that is slow or drags on but when the action starts dont blink because you wont want to miss any off itthere are some parts where you wish would have just hit someone but when he does get going you dont want to get in his waythis movie is definitely worth a look but you have to see this one on the big screen for optimal experience trust me spend the money dont wait till it comes out on dvd,cruel
after watching this movie i asked myself how can i rag this movie what is wrong with this movie and after due consideration i said to myself self i have no basis for ragging this movie this is a powerful compelling riveting movie with tremendous cinematography presenting a harrowing story this movie outprivate ryans saving private ryan this movie contains possibly some of the most stunning action cinematography ever filmed by a hollywood studio also this could be sylvester stallones best movie mr stallone succeeds in presenting a powerful action story with lots of special effects and incredible stunts without sacrificing character development the audience is told a lot about john and is given a glimpse of s philosophy of life excellent dialog great acting and incredible cinematography equals a great movie,cruel
grrr good old sylvester looking good for his age not a bad little film this better than expected though i did enjoy it more for the fact that you get to see mr stallones ample muscles looking good mr stallone whats the secret sir like mr stallone i like to keep trim and the way i do it is 1 x bran flakes for breakfast with semiskinned milk and a week old banana for lunch a nice caesar salad washed down with a pint of milk and for supper stomach crunches and a banana slim fast sometimes though i have a steak sandwich and i have to whip myself for 3 days in penance a message to mr stallone you are the only man i love,cruel
me and my friends were in cinema deciding over either to watch the new avp or most of my friends were quite against watching thinking that it would be another mindless action movie an aging recreation of the 80s legendary action genre and we were also quite curious whether this movie might just turn out to be a hopeless sequel to a glorified series so then initially we all agreed to watch the new avp movie but apparently it was a house full so now feeling quite disappointed we then went to watch we went in with low expectations but after 1 hour and 30 minutes we came out with full of shock and fascination we were all amazed and were quite quick to approve the fact that movie had to be the most realistic modern warfare action movie to date although the movie had a very linear and a predictable storyline but then its after all action is what most of the people picture in their head when they think of so to conclude what really made a success was that it was very well directed on a very predictable storyline had a good cast just the way you would expect builtforwar soldiers to be in this case mercenaries the extremely intense action throughout the movie and the last but not the least character himself sylvester stallone credit must go to him for actingdirectingwriting such a great akickin movie live for nothing or die for something,cruel
is back stallone looking every bit his 61 years but he can still deliver a knockout punchthe violence is certainly gratuitous and kudos to the make up artist for the absolute bloodiest shootings that i can rememberthere is no hollywood shootings ie several bullets to take someone down so in other wordsshoots people diei couldnt be sure if the saga has endedwho knows who will bring out of quasiretirementmaybe the terrorists i can think of worse movies to seedefinitely not a date movie unless you are taking your guya shoot em up for sure with saying about 10 words throughout,cruel

my favorite line is during s dream sequence as he mutters i didnt kill for my country i killed for myself this was the most sincere and honest demotion of war we are always taught by american propaganda how soldiers and being a soldier is defending and fighting for the good old usa when in reality when the chips are down we ultimately defend ourselves in times of violence and conflictstallones final installment of is a power house of violence and good special effects the acting is adequate and stallone gives one of his most brooding and truthful performances although he looks older and a bit more dissipated hes still tough and strong as nails like a commando tarzan hybrid the setting takes place in burma where there is actually a genocide occurring there as rebels pillage maim rape dismember and destroy the weak inhabitants of the local villages along the river decides to assist a group of karen christians and hired mercenaries to fight the rebels so you know the suspense builds up quite well but for the grace of god comes to save the day by defying all odds of bombs explosions and numerous hails of gunfire hes instigating his oneman army with a little aid from the other folksmy main qualm is that the script shies away from being too wordy or leading to moral themes and allows the action to overtake the plot but we arent complaining we are here to see the macho bad ass pave his way into movie iconolatry not apocalypse now,cruel

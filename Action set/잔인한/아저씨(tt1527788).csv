simply wowa lot of people are put off by foreign language films and i hope those people dont let that stop them from watching thisit has all the panache of a typical hollywood film and i have to disagree with some comments that the backstory aspect is lacking compared with the action my exact thoughts when watching this film were along the lines of i cannot believe how genuine the character development is the bond between the two main characters is extremely believable huge props to the actress who played the young kid i thought the fact that the film wasnt edited down to the hourandhalf standard probably gave them more room to develop and for an action film there was much more intelligence than i was expecting to the storyone of the best films i have seen in a long time910,cruel
this man is about as standard plotwise as action movies get a lone wolf type takes a little girl under his wing the kid gets kidnapped and he ends up having to go through heaps of bad guys in his quest to save the girl by all accounts the movie should have evoked little more than a shrug after all anyone who has seen even just a moderate amount of action movies will have seen countless movies with variations of this basic plot one might think of leon or man on fire for some closer examples or movies such as taken in other respects what made this movie into my favorite action movie in a long while is the execution of that basic plot this man manages to create just the right dark gloomy mood to match the story and all the characters are believable none of the scenes appear contrived or overly tearjerker another vital aspect for an action movie is of course that the action sequences are very well done the movie is quite graphic but not gratuitously so or for its own sake such as in many a recent horror movie the saw series comes to mindi guess the movie could be likened to a good apple pie  certainly nothing revolutionary in fact quite the staple of its genre but who would want to turn down a really good apple pie with quality ingredients,cruel
let me start off by saying that i was skeptical whether i should watch this movie because of all the comparisons here to us productions because while i did enjoy most of the ones named not enough to want to see a basically south korean copycat at the theaterif you fear the same thing dont worry this movie is exactly what you would expect from great korean cinema comparable to the likes of the chaser memories of murder and a bittersweet life in this movie there is lots of rather believable tragedy little kitsch there is the occasional unsuitable oneliner and the girl sometimes says things that in my opinion are too mature for her age and yank a little too much at the emotional chain  these are basically the things that brought my rating down to 910 and a fair amount of graphic violence and realism in the fighting scenes there are also some wacky characters just like they appear somewhat frequently in east asian productions but i think they fit in quite nicely despite the otherwise very serious toneif one were to compare it to a us production i would go with eg a history of violence because of the serious tone and the realism but still the overall style is drastically differentthe whole experience is nicely rounded off with a very beautiful score and the only thing i considered negative besides what i already mentioned was that the plot is moving very fast at various points i was not sure whether i didnt pay enough attention or whether details were left out meaning for instance how one character got the information about another character these connections of information between characters are not always clear in my opinion but it does not really hurt the story and i am sure that it would be clear with a second viewing  something that this movie absolutely deserves,cruel
was to come out of the viewing experience wowedas i sat watching the movie my general impression was this is a good movie it has a cool story the acting is great the characters are engaging the action is good but not proving itself to be better than what most movies normally put out therethen came the end and it ended with more than a bang more like a beautiful chaotic explosionthis movie as a whole was great i am in wow shock now the end was amazing but without the hour and a half of plot story characters suspense good fightaction scenes sweet revenge etc the end would not have been so incrediblethis movie is in comparison like a cross between taken bourne identity mildly similar to bourne he doesnt have memory problems or anything leon the professional and man on fire honestly this movie rivals them allits very gritty very brutal very violent and at times disturbing but there is a lot of emotion and heart building up at the center of it alli dont know if you are one of those idiots who dont watch these movies because they dont want to read the subtitles and think that the dubbing is too cheesy and would take away from the movie if you are get over it and you will end up experiencing a dynamic movie you otherwise would not have watchedif subtitles dont bother you then i suggest you go ahead and watch this one,cruel
this movie threatens to be a runofthemill action movie but manages to create its own identity the sameness is how it shows most of its bad guys and there are plenty as one dimensionally evil there are children who are put in harms way but not gratuitouslyfor the most partproviding the hero with a chance to be humanits very korean in its thinking which is always refreshing to me saying that i was surprised by how much it reminded me of taxi driver its not a retread by any means but it almost felt like the director was paying tribute to the earlier film in a couple of scenes i have no idea if this is true most people i have talked to about this movie have never seen the otherthis is an action film and it does not disappoint on that level some of it is pretty brutal but by the finale you will most likely feel that everyone gets what they deserve and if anything a few deserved more this is because they manage to build characters we care about with out slowing down too much the pacing is nicely done with properly placed comic moments as well some of the humor was a bit dark which was also nicewhat surprised me was how much i cared for the main characters the child was sweet but not overly so im used to the child being inserted for sentimental or ahhhh effectslike in the first rush hourbut that is mostly avoided here and it feels much more genuine over allthere are cruel moments in the film but the film itself did not feel cruel that is why i liked it so often films are either mindless or meanspirited and this one avoided these pitfalls,cruel
you may want to compare this with or see shades of the film from the likes of luc bessons the professional pierre morels taken and tony scotts man on fire with the common running theme of a highly skilled operative taking it upon himself to rescue someone they love from the clutches of devious villains and executing a brand of vengeance without remorse as he ploughs through and singlehandedly demolishes all who stand in his way the man from nowhere is south koreas answer to this subgenre and does so with aplomb both in providing that emotional punch to the highly choreographed set action piecesthe heartthrob won bin buffs up to become that titular character cha taesik a man with a secret past who now lives his life incognito in a shady pawnshop trade striking up his only friendship with the outside world through jeong somi kim sae ron from a brand new life doing an excellent job once again the kid from next door whose mom happened to offend drug traders who are also in the business of dealing with the lucrative body organs black market in fact the villains are portrayed in such negative light for the multitude of vices they get involved in including kidnapping children for an oliver twist type of artful dodging profession as couriers that you just cant wait for them to get their just dessertssomis capture and her moms demise moves the plot forward with cha having to rely on skills from his past to reclaim the only life of normalcy he knows as he goes on a one man rampage trying to piece together how deep the rabbit hole of villainy goes while on the chase by both the cops led by detective kim chigon kim taehun and the villains all out to put a stop to his series of destruction to their business like any korean film there is ample time given to deal with chas backstory as well as to showcase won bins good looks sans scruffy long hair and a perpetual scowl on the face his previous film mother and this one put together would already prove that won bin has a wide range of emotions to play unorthodox characters rather than just being another pretty boy on the blocknow for all the action junkies who think they may have seen it all this korean flick ups the ante in at least two scenes which makes you sit up and take notice that the stunt coordinators are no pushovers and can offer something refreshingly different theres that iconic leap from the balcony in the bourne ultimatum that had jason bourne chase someone through the balcony window in a leap thats followed by a camera here the same got pulled off with the major difference being knowing it is precisely the actor won bin himself executing the move from a second storey leap through the window followed by a roll on the ground to break fall all done in one swift motion and unless some devious trick is used thats the actor alrightthe other is the much lauded close quarters knife fight it may be inspired by the likes of oldboy or even repo men but this one held its own ground through its beautiful yes its a little weird using this to describe bloody violence choreography striking up that sense of all round danger with cha going for the jugular with a lesson on anatomy with respect to where major arteries are located paralyzing his opponents before fatally dealing with some this culminates in part b that moved from many to one to a one on one battle that occasionally puts you in the first persons perspective those scenes alone will be reason enough to watch this for a second time and for fans of the revenge thriller flicks the man from nowhere sets to deliver the no bs dead serious treatment that will leave you applauding each time any bad guy bites the dust recommended,cruel
korean thriller makers are making a splendid job nowadays they have even succeeded the hollywood thriller makers in this specific genrethe man from nowhere is a perfect example of this anyone might think this is a mix of leonthe professional and man on fire where a highly trained but troubled person tries to protect a child but this movie is more than thatthere are many short but strong stories nicely fabricated that will keep you watching the total movie in a rush now come to the story a mystery man with no past links suddenly becomes involved in a drug transport because of a child being kidnapped and unfortunately that child was the only link of him to the outerworld so had to comeout from his own hideout and save the girl and find out the persons behind it he has to defy the police as they are after it too at a point the sad past life comes to daylight and it was well understood about his strange behavior of everything this rouge so renegades the force and takes the action by his own the stylish bourne looking action scenes specially needs to be appreciatedbut i m not giving it the highest rating only its lacking of showing the touchy emotions in the best wayit was excess silence play a better role than words in some situations it needed that but the overall movie was simply sublimereasonable violence was shown hereit was logical some funny characters and parts are nicely putted into that enhanced the color and variety of the movie but i am getting addicted to this korean thrillers memories of a murder joint security area vengeance trilogy including oldboy infernal affairs trilogy the chaserthirstthe bittersweetness of life i saw the devilthe serial is getting longer and longerkeep it up ,cruel
after a long hiatus im actually looking forward for a new moviedrama from won bin and when i find out about man from nowhere i didnt miss a chance to watch this moviecha tae sik won binis a mystery man who lead a quiet life and own a pawn shop his neighbor is the girl somi and her heroin addict mother hyojeong the mother smuggles drug from the drug trafficking organization and later murdered by them somi was kidnapped and become one of the kids who work for the drug dealer this is when we tae sik turn out to be an exspecial agent cha deal with the drug dealer in order to save somii dont want to go details about the storyline what i want to highlight is the relationship between tae sik and somi thats the part i enjoy the most about this film you will find the relationship between tae sik and somi wonderful and heartwarming it makes me cry when somi say its okay if the fat boy at school say im a garbage but for you tae sikto ignore me its really hurt in here heart i dont want to hate you because if i do then theres no person in this world that i love the ending also for sure will make everyone cryits a good film and is worth watching especially to won bin fan but there are scenes that you may find it so cruel and disturbing  and you will definitely love the cute somi shes one great actress,cruel
when i first saw the trailer to this movie i wanted to go see it but wasnt like super hyped up for it it basically looked like the korean version of leon the professional but this movie is like the korean version of man on fire with fight sequences that are similar to the bourne movies i heard this film really skyrocketed won bins popularity especially in korea and i could tell why he really is a badass in this movie and his charisma is overflowing in this movie one of the girl in the audience couldnt help but say he is so cool in korean during the scene where won bins character is driving angrily while on the phone with the bad guys while showing some intimidating emotion the plot isnt super original or anything basically man on fire with a better flow and more dark and gritty with better action in my opinion overall this film was a lot better than i expected and also kept my interest from beginning to end while also being entertained the style of this movie reminded me of a bittersweet life in a good way which is a plus with saturated colors leaning towards the dark and blue some people might get a bit irritated by the constant camera shot to won bins face while he takes a pose like in some magazine or something but i could tell its to sell the movie to female viewers as well excellent casting pretty good story with some slick action scenes make this movie really worth seeing there is something for guys and girls8310,cruel
have you ever thought how lost and distraught one can be following the loss of hisher loved ones i guess this is a point that is worth pondering over especially when we are witnessing such a tragedy unfolding in japan the man from nowhere widely known as in south korea essentially depicts a man who has withdrawn himself from the society and lost his sense of worth and living due to the lost of his loved ones however he finally began to show affection and fondness in the little girl lives down the street it was just like how tin man finally found his heart they were each others only friend so when she is taken away he fights with all his might and wit because he cannot possibly handle the loss of his only beloved friendthis simple plot is very well executed in terms of the pacing it was just right and through subtle interactions between taesik played by won bin and somi played by kim saeron they show their high interdependency and chemistry there was not a single part of the movie that is boring your tension is constantly kept at high and you will be sometimes treated with some tidbits of laughter the narrative is definitely not the only attraction to this movie that eventually became the top selling movie in south korea in the year 2010 possibly the other main attraction is the films cinematography this movie has superb fight choreography underscores superb brace yourself for a bloody massacre but one that is not just of a bloody mess but of mission and gracefulness this coupled with creative angles and excellent sound effects you get a movie that is of high production value this alone assures you that the money that you spend on the movie is worthwhilehow can one forget the other important factor its the protagonist won bin has made several breakthroughs in his acting career that started back in 1997 however this is probably by far the most successful role that he has taken up with this single role he has bagged 7 awards is that justified certainly from the initial bizarre look and stare to later on how he soften his look towards the little girl he wants to protect to the flashback where it depict his downfall and devastation to the ruthless and merciless look that was fuelled by hatred and despair when he was in search of the little girl they were all effectively delivered to the audience you can get so drawn into his acting that you may feel the sheer violence is justified one moment you grief with the man who lost his loved ones the next moment you crease your forehead at his brutality the balance of this multifaceted character is definitely not easy but won bin did it also commendable is that there was no stuntman that stood in for the combat scenes all the fist knives and guns action were executed by him his black belt in taekwondo definitely comes in handy for his role indeed he has proved himself to be more than just an eye candyas the movie is coming to an end it takes on a twist that prevented another episode of tragedy the ending scene was definitely perplexing at first but it turns out to be the man has finally found his home for his heart where he can pour out his affection and love once more with the calming ending track leading into the credits you cannot help but be affected that is being moved to tears to sum it all great acting great production great moviewwwmoviexclusivecom,cruel
i dont know about those romantic crap lovers with strange sexual tendencies but for real men this is the kind of film you would like to see with your fellas having some beer and pizza while saying things like oh s what tha did you see that yes it is an old theme yes its similar to taken the professiona man on fire and even other koreans like the trilogy of vengeance and i saw the devilbut still is so cool in such unique ways that you may want to see it a couple of times while showing your american friends how independent filming is done in asiaat the beginning i thought it would be like many korean movies with long slow paced scenes dramatizing events but no it turned out to be a well balanced action movie with a proper ending,cruel
youve seen the story before in the professional or man on fire man with a checkered past gets drawn into unintentional friendship with kid who falls prey to bad guys due to extraordinary circumstances plot is actually fairly unique and interesting we get a peek at a creative underworld business strategy in seouls chinatown one of the bad guys has a fun role and the relationship between the hero and the kid comes across as pretty genuine action is pretty decent as well if you turn off your realism filter dialogue and writing are slightly subpar but it doesnt detract too much from the pace and plot of the film it shouldnt win many awards but this film is worth watching for sure,cruel
the plot isnt original a damaged special agent trying to lead a quite life gets dragged into danger to protect a young girl but it is done very wellthe pace is good we have a nice mix of action and story at the start to make cha taesiks attachment to the girl believable the action gets more involved and quicker as we progressthe acting is good bin won is convincing and for a change so are the villains they arent over the top comic book evil they are just criminals and the big surprise is that saeron kim manages to play the annoying child character without being annoying an excellent performance from herthe action sequences are well done violent without being very gory some elaborate martial arts and some simple brutalitythe ending is ok it tries to hard to be emotional but at least it doesnt try to be clean and sanitisedit reminded me most of the bourne films and although it is a lower grade than they are you should still find a lot to enjoy here if you liked them,cruel
i am captivated by child actors that can really put out a fantastic performance saeron kim is one such actress she alone makes this film work watchingbut the story is really about the pawnbroker cha taesik bin won charles bronson has nothing on him anyone who crosses his path really has a death wish and that death will probably not be clean and prettyusing the considerable skills he learned in the military cha runs through the evil doers like a knife though butter if you like a history of violence you will love this film and if you like bin won you have to see mother,cruel
as of recent ive been watching several good revenge flicks in the likes of taken man on fire the brave one edge of darkness and death sentence all these movies work in there own ways not because of nonstop awesome action but because of the emotional appeal and pacing this film is no differentthe man from nowhere follows cha taesik a long haired and deep voiced man who likes to keep a low profile his only real link to a normal life and only friend comes from his neighbor somi after somi and her mom are kidnapped by gangsters looking for their stolen drugs as cha tae sik gets closer to fining somi the more his mysterious past comes on to the openthe man from nowhere is nothing we havent scene before plot wise and is not crammed with action what makes the man from nowhere work is its phenomenal pacing and exceptional acting from most of the cast in the beginning you know next to nothing about cha taesik but by the end of the movie a lot comes clear about why he acts the way he does the real action takes awhile to hit but when it hits it really hits this was some of the most realistic and brutal action ive ever seen from korea a very impressive knife fight towards the end of the movie is worth your patience trust methe acting from bin woncha taesik and somisaeron kim was amazingly touching you really cared about these characters which gave strength to this movie by the end you will almost be in tearsthe directing of this movie was also some of the best ive seen from korea the dark tone and nearly flawless picture shows me how far up asian cinema has come a stand out shot is when cha taesik jumps out of a window two or three stories up rolls over and continues running all seemingly in one take i think it was cg stitched together but it looked very convincingoverall this movie has an old plot but stands out because of the tone pacing and wonderful acting i recommend this movie to anyone who loves good revenge flicks you wont be disappointed,cruel
i found out about this movie by searching for the best ranked korean films in this site after getting excited by the excellent the watcher and well to be honest this movie is kind of a 65 to me but imdb has no way of specifying it first of all i love oriental cinema specially korean lately so the quirky humor and weird characters arent a problem altough the chubby police man kinda annoyed me im used to them still the movie has a few problems on its own on the good side the movie is fast paced entertaining and the fight scenes especially the last one are great kinda reminds me of the first bourne movie some characters are memorable like the main character who is a mix of reevesneeson but then again some are plain ridiculous and exaggerated like the villain who always dresses in white all in all its a very entertaining movies with just a few flawed moments unfortunately for me those flaws killed the mood at certain times and they were unnecessarystill its a very decent movie and a nice addition to the korean cinema,cruel
asian crime dramas about the devastation of heroin distribution seem to be all the rage now however i applaud this film as this is only one facet to a larger story what we have in the man from nowhere is essentially three types of crime movies rolled into one where the film succeeds is that it does not borrow too heavily from predecessors in the korean revenge circuit and proceeds to craft an interesting story with elements that are both unique and welcome to the genre the plot revolves around an isolated mans friendship with a little girl that reminds him of a life he used to enjoy before it was taken away well the little girl ends up being taken away and a cat  mouse game ensues to get her back he will stop at nothing to redeem himself for the life he once lost and cannot bear losing it a second time this story has been done many times however there are further developments in the plot that completely changes the structure of the movie making it another beast altogether the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous with seoul being presented in many perspectives which you can feel like modern corrupt beautiful destructive etc the acting is all top notch and not for one moment did any performance or dialogue take me out of the atmosphere of the movie the only issue that bothered me was the way certain characters were introduced and how they were connected to others it becomes hard to decipher the ties between the many baddies that appear in this film and while this may be intentional to keep the audience in the dark revealing the characters to the audience later on still came across as convoluted there are multiple bad guys which do multiple functions for multiple organizations which becomes a mess for the audience to figure out a minor complaint but less screen time should have been spent for certain disposable baddies now the action is presented in explosive bursts it is genuinely gritty and intense which is seen in few action movies today the film is not an action movie by any stretch however the few sequences that are in here are worth the price of admission alone they are built up and they do deliver the drama is exaggerated but reasonable for the subject matter although one or two evil acts the bad guys do are just stupid and darkly comical regardless the man from nowhere is a very entertaining revenge film and i wholeheartedly recommend to those seeking a fresh twist on bare knuckle bloodshed 810,cruel
i have been a fan of korean thrillerdrama since the revenge trilogy so my standards have been set very high i went into this movie hoping i wouldnt be disappointed and that it wouldnt try to be another oldboyand i was pleasantly surprisedthere are a lot of clichs about the film including reminders of leon in the sense of a brooding loner with a desperate connection to a little girl but it really works the police and the bad characters are also clichd but in a good convincing way the story line about the brutality of the koreanchinese gangs and their complete lack of value for any human life is believable and sadfew things raised the film above other good asian violent gangster flicks for me the lead character was very well played his portrayal of the man in solitary pain was great and im glad there was no ott outbursts to try and explain his character or history the little girl was also excellent and convincing their relationship really works with some genuinely touching moments also the fights scenes were well above other flicks ive seen they were brilliantly executed and struck a good balance between violent but not ottoverall it was a thoroughly satisfying movie and im glad i chose it,cruel
so let me get this straightsome people like to compare this to iconic movies such as leon the professional and taken which themselves are movies ive already seen and immensely enjoyed of course some elements and little pieces of plot are borrowed but that is not quite so as the movie at its on right stands strongly as an original masterpiece everything shots characters music and choreographed fighting scene has that certain wow factor and is sublime in the movie beautifully directed by director jeongbeom leetaesik cha acted by bin won who also appeared in the korean crime movie mother 2009 and brother hood of war 2004 puts out an excellent display of acting melodrama and slick fighting i am judgemental about character appearance and the choice of his haircut is intriguing to note at the beginning which from some bizarre oddities with me today i thought i should write the longmetro sexy haircut we often associate with justic bieber is an element designed to mask his shadowy and mysterious past it also acts to mislead the antagonists about his unknown strengths which i got to say is spectacular when revealed in action scenesthose guys didnt knew who they were dealing with mid way through the movie the act of cutting his hair signalled a climatic turning point to save his unfortunate neighbour mido and an heightening problem for the gangsters he is confronting with he meant business taesik angrily warns the captors that people living for tomorrow have no chance living today  which is sort of true of course what he promises he delivers and theres no short of expectations of the body count that piles up later onoverall the movie is awesome and is highly recommended to watch for blokes who can tolerate a bit of melodrama most times when i watch tear jerking moments i act indifferent but in the movie the man from nowhere the tear jerking moments was presented very honestly and without clich so i got a little bit emotionainside,cruel
the mysterious taesik cha bin won has grown attached to his precocious neighbor somi saeron kim despite her drugaddled mums objection the latters involvement in stealing narcotics from major heavies results in somis being kidnapped taesik is inadvertently thrust into seedy world of drugs trade  human organ harvesting syndicate but the brooding hero possess array of unique skills to take on the baddies and rescue somishades of shane 1953 and man on fire 1987 in terms of story but this south korean actioner has immaculate productions values and absorbing pace to maintain interest from beginning to end and what about that tremendous climatic knifefight culminating with bloody faceoff against thai actor thanayong wongtrakul playing the silent henchman,cruel

i was just browsing through imdb genres to add some good movies to my watch list and i came up against this i must admit that this is by far the best action movie considering the story line which is based on the reality in which we live in as most of the action films are either fiction or unrealthis movie is surely not made for the weak hearted and for the kids however if u really want to enjoy a good action movie with a real story line then this one is surely in ur bucket listi guess this one is surely an example set for the others that stories does matter more than the money spent on the effects 3d graphics animation,cruel
it doesnt take much to piece together a competent action flick but this film goes the extra mile armed with an elaborate soundtrack increasingly brutal action and a pair of powerful performances from bin won and kim saeron the man from nowhere is a onetwo punch worth remembering,cruel
this is just another normal story with splashy screenplay and a great directionthe protagonist played by binwon is an exspecial force agent living a life without a meaning due to his past tragedy he befriends a girl whos her neighbour and suddenly his life gets a meaning when the little girls mom gets into trouble with a wrong group of people thats the outline of the story though its just another normal storythe execution stands out unlike any other action thriller the film deals with scenes filled with silent emotions which helps the viewers to understand the gravitysometimes emotions can be ruined by words but the director chooses to address it with the universal language action scenes stand out and binwon has given a immensely subtle but at the same time a great performance once the protagonist chooses to pursue the kid the viewers are in for an action ride silent scenes with subtlety makes the film one of the best south korean movie to watch if you are a fan of action movie then do not miss out this movie,cruel
this movie is a mixture of bourneleon there is nothing new about it a man protects a girl but its fun its thrilling the fight scenes are awesome if you are looking for some good kick butt time like bourne youll have it and the drama is good enough to touch you hollywood does not have this drama part in an action movie but koreans always pull it off there is one or two parts thats gonna make your eyes teary and most of all i liked this movie because it was a happyending i was tired of main characters dying in korean movies but this one doesntkorean movies are getting there,cruel
those who have put this down in their reviews obviously dont know an amazing film when they see one i am a huge fan of the action and martial arts genres i usually dont watch subtitled films but this had high marks so i checked it out i certainly wasnt expecting incredible acting outstanding direction and editing a flawless score all with the action and martial arts i love and the fighting wasnt gratuitous just for fightings sake it was only used if part of the story line ok so the plot overall wasnt anything new or fresh so what it still was an excellent execution of the story and kept me riveted from start to finish this main actor is a star im sure he can speak english and could easily be as popular as jet li or chow yun fat here in the states now im off to look up some of his other films if youre thinking of watching this and youre a fan of dramatic action films then this is an absolute must see just click play already,cruel
you have to remember that there is a school of thought that suggests that martial arts were invented in korea whether you buy that premise or not you can be assured they take their action movies seriously on paper the notion of a mysterious pawnbroker with an unknown past who just wants to be left alone who befriends the child of a local partygirl  well it does not prepare you for this adventure in truth this film has more in common with matt damon as bourne than any other recent american film i can think of he is polite he is pleasant but you push this guy the wrong way and bang the bodies just start to pile up no question some blevel hollywood shop will go for the fast dollar and do a remake but this will always be the one to watchupdated may 2015  in 2013 i said the hollywood version was a lock i was right it was called the equalizer and starred denzel washington it was a combination of this story and the old tv series of the same name in the final scene of this us version which many missed the writers left the door open for a sequel or even a franchise which appears to have been greenlighted as i pen these words and i was right about something else  this version is still better see it ,cruel
the man from nowheremy love for korean movies is starting to become very obsessive while the theme of revenge has present throughout many films such as man on fire taken etc this one is awesome yet sada quiet man who works at a pawnshop squares off with the mafia to save a girlthe pluses woh bin the action scenes the innocence of the little girl and the story moved a lot fasterthe minuses too gory and so much cussingoverall the man from nowhere is an awesome gun toting movie it may be a simple story guy saving girl but no it is much more complex than that this movie is not for sensitive viewers 910,cruel
i watched it twice a little bloody so much so that its not quite believable i wonder if that style of using blood is closer to actuality than what ive seen in most american made movies chas acting is superb he is really gorgeous although a little skinny actually all the actors were excellent so mi is such a beautiful little girl her scenes made me cry wish cha had smoother fighting moves during the last fight i did not expect ip man smooth but the moves could have been a little better i have never seen so many good looking koreanasian hope im correct men in my life especially the leader of the three government guys that came to take over the investigation into cha wow this was really a nice change from hollywood movies which uses the same 50 are so actors for every movie made,cruel
what we have here is the story of a child who through the failings of her mother ends up being taken to be used as basically a drug mule for a gang it just so happens that her neighbor whom she has developed the beginnings of a father daughter relationship has just the type of background needed to help rescue her well executed cast of gang members you have the bold the drugged out the brutes the crazies etc that is very believable and the fight scenes are quite well done altho in the beginning they tend to only hint at our protagonists fighting prowess leaving us asking for much more but they do deliver on that ending in one epic finale with very good knife fighting choreography the story itself is well done and our lead man does a great job in making us feel that even though he is the strong silent type he becomes strongly emotionally attached to his little friend the little girl does a fairly good job of playing the outcast child altho her pain is less believable also didnt help that the end got dragged out just a tad long in terms of emoting in summation  good action good story line nothing over the top convoluted as far as plot structure and a strong actor in the lead role glad i watched this,cruel
a spectacular performance by the the lead character supported by a moving performance by an upcoming sweet youngster my case is not one who saw this film expecting a soso reward at best no i have seen a few other korean films in the past and had an idea of what i was getting into though not specifically i will simply say i got my moneys worth though i must confess i saw it online streamed legally for close to nothing but if i had paid full price for it at a theater my time and money would have been well spent i wont go into a summary or synopsis since thatll only lead to spoilers and besides i expect the reader would have read the lead summary anyway all ill say is the key attribute of this film is its unique ability to elicit emotions across the spectrum at any given time and at the turn of a dime film buffsaficionados will acknowledge such a task on the part of a director is by no means easy watch the film if you havent already done so and recall my point when a korean speaking actor responds in english with one word to an english speaking actor in the carthis is a treat of a film one i would pay to see again if asked just as a gesture of artistic support,cruel
im a big fan of both revenge films and korean films having seen some great movies out of korea over the past few years i decided to give the man from nowhere a watch i loved itso it starts with our hero taesik as a sort of rundown figure his hair is long hes quiet lonely and hiding a dark past no one really pays him any attention except somi a little girl who lives near taesik and doesnt have the best family life they sort of relate to each other until somi and her mother are abducted by a ruthless mafia of organ harvesters and drug dealers and our movie takes off from therei was reminded of several popular american films from taken to man on fire and the presentation of the bourne films however i found the man from nowhere to be a much better film something about the relationship between this lonely man with a violent past and this little girl who he works so hard to rescue came off as genuine and boy does taesik work hardthe action in this film is great a mix of wellchoreographed handtohand scenes as well as intense shootouts and struggles one thing that puts the man from nowhere above other well known korean revenge dramas of fairly recent years is that the gore isnt too overthetop believe me ive enjoyed my fair share of ridiculous violence but something about the unrealistic brutality in say i saw the devil by jeewoon kim takes me out of the experience im distracted from the emotion thats not to say that the man from nowhere isnt over the top taesik is a supersoldier of sorts and is seen taking on armed men outnumbered sometimes twenty to one and still coming out on top and yet these scenes didnt have the blood geysers of kill bill or anything like that there was indeed blood but the right amount of blood where the film can still be taken seriouslyand thats my analysis of the violence in the film i felt that was an important aspect when comparing it to other korean films of this genre the violence is really used as a way of expressing taesiks passion for rescuing his captured neighbor often i felt that his emotions were told by his facial expression ive never seen lead actor bin won on screen before and from what i understand some see him as a teen idol of sorts but his performance was really well done here and not to mention that young actress saeron kim as somi actually wasnt annoying as i personally find most kid actorson the negative side the beginning is a little slow i can think of several movies that people would consider boring and slow that i like very much but this came across as slow even to me thats only the beginning though it does get very good during the second half theres really not much more bad i can say about this film my score would be a nine were it not for the first acts pace as it stands consider my review a high eight thanks for reading and enjoy the movie,cruel
essentially an asian variant on the liam neeson hit taken the man from nowhere sees a quiet man driven to violence when a child neighbour is kidnapped by a drugs gang south korea is gathering a reputation for making some of the toughest and best thrillers of the last decade id previously watched and loved the chaser so i had some idea of what to expect here and this is another triumphthe movie offers a perfect balance between plotting and action theres plenty of storyline and characters to get involved with and the action sequences complement the plot perfectly won bin makes for the usual quiet mantype hero not much to look at but once he gets going hes phenomenal the bad guys are well drawn and given more characterisation than elsewhere the heartstrings are pulled effectively and the action choreography is spectacular particularly that final knifefight if this is a good example of korean cinema today then i cant wait to see more,cruel
i havent watched an asian film for a while if not of my friend who talked a lot of good things about this film i would like to acknowledge the director for directing incredible artists who portrayed tremendous performances who actually touched my feelings and emotions in many different ways the main character embellished as a young hero who can really save by the speed of his fists his skills in weapons to defend himself and remorseful countenance in his face in order to portray his agony compassion to save his only beloved object the little girl and the children yet you can see this man in contrasting character the softness side of him when he really cried and could see the real tears coming down from his eyes the voice clarity of the movie is another standout unlike certain movies i have to stop and replay the parts i did not understand i enjoyed so much listening how they pronounced and emphasized words according to the character portrayed i have seen asian movies in the past and the dubbing were the worst part entertainingly the movie was beautifully crafted i was at my seat all throughout enjoying every moment since there were some scenes of brutal killings i am though suggesting for adult viewers only enjoy the movie,cruel

super deadly killer with super human strenght reflexes and what not starts a friendship with a girl that lives in the same apartment building where he lives the mother of the girl is in trouble with the mob the little girl is in danger our hero awakes from his slumber and goes super saiyan level 4 and wrecks hell on mobstersthats about it now the problem is among other things how the protagonist is pretty much invincible he gets the obligatory action clich scene where they have to remove a bullet from him but aside from that he destroys his enemies so easily there is little to no tension in the action sequences the friendship between him and the girl is also rather dull and never feels very convincing or engaging add a highly annoying stupid detective and you have a set of insipid characters the action sequences range from decent to average while there are some nice camera tricks here and there one including a continuous shot going from inside a building to the street other moments suffer from the jerkycamera syndrome of todays action cinema performances are also very painfully averagenot really worth of the cult status some people are throwing to this one ok to kill a rainy saturday but even so you might just want to pick a better action movie,cruel
 you live only for tomorrow i only live for today korean films have been making a lot of noise in the past decade and many critics believe that they are making the best films at the moment as well i only had the opportunity to watch the host and oldboy before getting around to watching the man from nowhere oldboy is considered by many as one of the best all time korean films but i wasnt too overwhelmed by it i thought it was good but not enough to get me interested in korean films the same thing happened with the host but now i that ive seen the man from nowhere directed by jeongbeom lee i want to see more i really loved this movie and thought it was great it was a character driven action film with some powerful scenes and a memorable lead performance by bin won who also worked in mother another successful korean film this film reminded me a lot of a couple of western films like man on fire and taken but with the extra ingredient of being from korea so you would expect better fight scenes and a much darker tone the film is very dark at times and violent but it also has interesting characters and a gripping story the story isnt original weve seen it before many times but the mood of the film and the lead performance are what make it so entertaining this movie had it all my only complaint was that the melodrama was a bit over the top there were a couple dramatic scenes that didnt work too well but the spectacular fighting scenes made up for it this movie was better than i expected and loved it much more than the other korean films i had seen now i just want to watch moreas i mentioned before the plot isnt very original we have the quiet and reclusive man in this case a pawnshop owner named cha taesik bin won who has a hidden and violent past he lives a solitary life and isnt much of a talker his life changes when a neighboring little girl named somi saeron kim begins intruding his life and trying to befriend him shes a smart girl who lives with her drug addict mother hyojeong hyoseo kim when her mother decides to steal some drugs from a dangerous drug trafficking organization everything changes for cha taesik first of all hyojeong hides the drugs in a bag which she leaves at the pawnshop without chas knowledge when the dealers catch up with somis mother they kidnap both of them and force cha to deliver the drugs to another dealer cha accepts to deliver the drugs as long as they dont touch somi but what he doesnt know is that the deal is a setup to eliminate another drug ring leader and that they have no intention of letting them go cha discovers hyos body which is missing several organs and realizes that hes not only dealing with a drug trafficking cartel but an organ dealer one as well that is when cha taesik begins hunting down the men responsible for the kidnapping of somi and unleashing his merciless fury the drug dealers have messed with the wrong mandespite the story being predictable it is memorable thanks to the great action scenes which are brutal and violent at times the film also owes great deal of its success to bin won for his performance in the lead role in the same way that taken worked thanks to liam neeson or man on fire thanks to denzel washington he had the look and the qualities you would look for in this type of film bin won is one cool dude no matter how he cuts his hair yes the film has several clichs and melodramatic moments but it stands out from those average movies and delivers some memorable scenes there are great choreographed fighting scenes especially near the end of the film in the climatic final battle and there are also some great shots like one in which the camera follows bin won as he jumps out of a window from a second floor these qualities are what make the man from nowhere stand out from other similar movies and the film will stick with you long after the credits have rolled i will definitely be checking out more korean films like this one because they have a unique atmosphere and setting i really loved the dark mood of this film and how they mixed it with some humorous momentshttpestebueno10blogspotcom,cruel
the man from nowhere is not exactly unique the premise is a young girl who is kidnapped by drugdealers organ traffickers after her mother gets involved with them her neighbour is a mysterious young man who owns a pawnshop and while he doesnt show it to her face he cares deeply for her and she is his only friend in the world what follows is a riveting ride featuring the somewhat reluctant main character in his quest to bring back the young girl some may refer to this as a revenge flick however i do not think this is the case as the violence committed by the man is not undue he always attempts to get her back without fighting however obviously this does not work out the cinematography is superb as is the acting and the writing it is kind of tough to get the full feel of the film without being able to understand korean but i managed as the subtitles were for the most part accurate the characters were great i usually become annoyed with the main characters and start to quietly cheer for the antagonists however in the man from nowhere not even doubts of the main hero came across my mind shocking for someone like me you quickly become emotionally involved with the characters if you enjoy action of any sort you will love the man from nowhere bin won is great the little girl is surprisingly good and the supporting actors never detract from the movie a great sign do yourself a favour and check this movie out,cruel

what happens if you put the best child actress ever called kim saeron of the wonderful drama a brand new life and the incredibly gifted actor won bin of mother and the brotherhood of war in one cast you get a masterpiece that cant be reproduced by anyone and that mixes incredible emotions with profound characters a gripping and sometimes surprising plot and tons of amazing action scenes and liberating slaughter passages its a pity for the western world but south korea produces many movies like this one while american movies of that kind happen to be ordinary stuff like getaway this film dynamically mixes elements of genres such as dramas action films and thrillers in one and doesnt forget about a few humorous and philosophical moments to give this rollercoaster ride a few breaks i wont give away any plot details because you must watch it yourself but i might mention that this film of course includes many memorable scenes the moment when the young child experiences how her mother takes drugs and is tortured by pitiless criminals was really intense the final action scene of the movie is one of the most brutal and at the same time liberating scenes of that kind ever done in cinema the best part is though the very last scene of the movie just as it should be in a perfect movie if you dont have tears in your eyes while watching this you are simply inhumanthis movie has a very good reputation but its not yet good enough it proves once again why south korea has created the best movies worldwide in the last fifteen years this film is at the same level as oldboy a tale of two sisters i saw the devil my way and so on those who dont recognize the quality of this movie dont know anything about cinema i dont want to give away any details just try anything you can to watch and purchase this masterpiece of contemporary cinema,cruel
the plot isnt anything new but as far as this genre goes lonely man saves the day this movie has to be the best one of its kind it makes taken look like childs play and the lead actors won bin charisma is off the hook even with little dialogue he is able to convey so much emotion just with his eyes great actor that needs to do more movies in my opinion also the action in this movie is flawless it has the most epic knife battle i have ever seen on screen the knife battle was truly a masterpiece and i dont usually say that one thing that sets this movie apart from taken leon man on fire is that it brings out an emotional reaction from the viewer i actually cried like a little girl during this movie its the first action movie i have ever cried in simply brilliant south korea you have done it again,cruel

so this is a very asian story about a quiet but skillful knight going to rescue a very adorable little damsel in distress and its absolutely good and i mean everything the story is well put together albeit quite simple and very leon like the acting with very little exceptions is brilliant and the directing is on par with that if you enjoy some guns blazing combined with a very well built drama about a very real subject human trafficking and drugs and martial arts without the magical acts like in so many american and chinese movies these days this is a movie for you oh i almost forgot the soundtrack is good too especially the main title so enjoy,cruel
dont get me wrong its great stuff if you havent seen a single thriller in the past 20 years officially being south korean it is formulaic hollywood filmmaking that doesnt even work well on that level there is no distinctive style and of course its overedited an unnecessarily complicated plot for something thats devoid of substance and overall theres very little fun to be had which mostly comes from quirky sidecharacters its probably enough to have only seen tony scotts man on fire for the story of to feel stale if furthermore you have seen taken with liam neeson you have seen a similar story taken to an extreme level that borders on parody so in that case is unlikely to work for you solely based on its storyperhaps above all this another problem i had with it was the for me lack of characters to care about whenever it tries to make one care for the characters it is overdoing it with obvious scenes that have little to no other purpose and in the end those people still lack much personality apparently the viewer is basically supposed to care about the girl despite being a drag and a thief simply because she is a child and because the mother was a crack whore and for the man from nowhere one is supposed to care about because his pregnant wife got killed on the account of him and now the seclusive man is more or less nice to that aforementioned girl that gets no love and he eventually even gets out of his way to rescue the girl and even goes so far that he is about to commit suicide when he thought he failed but of course the girl shows up before he can pull the trigger becausewell hes a good man at heart and not because the two actually have much of a bond to speak ofyou can rest assured that the film doesnt miss out on using flashbacks to provide backstory for the socalled man from nowhere does it show the wife getting killed well yes its a several minutelong flashback of the tragic event that is included after we already heard several times what happened with the flashback bringing very little new to the table in moments like those and in about any scene with the little girl is so sentimental it makes spielberg look like lars von trier one user on the movies message board made a pretty telling post when he said that he doesnt normally like foreign movies but this one was really awesome after opening his post with this was a great movie for anyone like me that grew up on steven seagal and van damme movies in the 90s my rating is admittedly harsh and im looking forward to reading 0 out of 12 people found the following review useful but nowadays i just have very little patience for formulaic films that are professionally made but unengaging or lacking in anything particularly interesting,cruel
if you want to experience a simple story told in brilliant way watch this moviethis is one of my all time fav movies the acting is excellent background score set the emotionscene straight and omg the action it is just brilliant mainly because the lead are performing themselves i am fan of action  gangster movies this movie is entertaining and have heart at the right place to unfold a simple storyi thank this movie to introduce me to world of korean cinema the girl is so cute in the movie i would have done the same for her   ,cruel
an excellent action crimethriller with enough action gore story and emotion packed into it its been ages since ive seen a good actionpacked thriller with no superherofuss involved as a fellow reviewer has mentioned this makes taken look like a childrens movie its taken with the brutality of kill bill the story isnt that original a man trying to protect or find a young girl  weve all seen leon man on fire taken etc but the way man from nowhere is crafted is what makes it so gripping and entertainingthe two lead characters cha taesik and somi are so wellrounded and have enough depth to sustain your interest the associated actors give praiseworthy performances too this is won bins third brilliant performance after tae guk gi and madeo mother he carries the movie on his shoulders with such charisma though he has very few dialogues he is terrific even in his silenceyou live for tomorrow  i only live for today ill show you just how fked up that can be,cruel
it is pretty rare to watch an action movie and actually feel like there was a measure of not only reality but a little justice as well while there are parts of this film that are obviously not the civilized definition of the latter there is something very satisfying about suspending your disbelief there is really no happily ever after here which is a welcome change to me i have always felt that movies that have to wrap up everything in a neat package for you somehow cheapen any sacrifices that were made by the characters to resolve their stories obviously there is a fine line between the entertainment value the reason we watch movies in the first place and the appreciation for the gravity of what we have watched it is really nice to watch something that actually makes you feel like all the blood and stress that brought you to the end credits actually had some impact this film has that in spades and doesnt sacrifice the entertainment factor to get there there are some very graphic scenes which to me only enforces this message real fights wouldnt be pretty and people who won them wouldnt be unscathed also people who are capable of killing large amounts of people for whatever reason shouldnt immediately be put in charge of the well being of children this is a fantastic movie that got a lot of things right,cruel
the movies plots were made unreasonable just to have a good emotional aspect its a waste of time the only thing good about this movie is the acting,cruel
well i would say maybe why  because the rating reflects not objectively the true qualities of the movies but more precisely the impact made on the audiencegiven the fact that its not made in hollywood i would say the almost eight stars are quite fair stillif you are a won bin fan you definitely will like it comparing it with the role from tae guk gi you can see that this is a good actorfar from me to compare this movie to leon man on fire etc why  because the story here labelled by some as unoriginal is one very different totally i might sayno spoilers i promised to myself well how can i explain better any other way  lets seea past paced thriller close to the end a drama at the beginning and a dramatic thriller as a whole the motivation is what differentiates it from the two movies named above from flashbacks we learn what triggers he reaction and the dramatic transformation undergone at a pointi agree more with the users comparing this movie to history of violence because of shocking transformation of the herosome might be unimpressed by the final battle one against so many  well even in that scene there is a reason more likely two reasons for the clarity of the path chosen by himthe ending  hmmm i do hope this is but a bridge to a second movie with the character,cruel

whats with this korean trope  sappyfy their otherwise pulsating thrillers with weak unnecessary melodramatic wimpy crying scenes ugh its like trying to enjoy a steak dinner when a cockroach suddenly falls into your plate gross that said ill try my best to erase the sappy scenes from my memory this was a pretty wellwritten albeit somewhat complex crime thriller there were also enough bloodsoaked scenes to satisfy gore hounds such as myself if i had the banknote and was into producing movies id hire the filmmakers behind the man from nowhere they understand tension and choreography well dialog wasnt too bad either could do without the forced comedic scenes though all in all a pretty good film if you can stomach those stringheavy syrupy melodramatic crying scenes,cruel
the man from nowhere has been compared to the professional but in this case the killerchild relationship is mostly at a distance without much time for a bond to develop beyond cliches about bad mothers and cool guys who cant display positive emotions the movie has lots of great individual moments involving knives tasers bathrooms and driving ranges but most of the characters including our protagonist are too cliched to take us beyond a collection of cool action shots the police subplot slows the film dramatically this wouldve been better at 90 minutes with the cops gone almost completely and the ending is totally unsatisfying skip it unless youre specifically into korean action thrillers,cruel

its been years since my initial watching and i can still say that every viewing feels like the first and thats primarily due to the fact that the characters are perfectly written the action sequences are amazing executed and the cinematography is immaculately directed its honestly the biggest shame that won bin is inactive as an actor considering the fact that his performance in this film rivals some of his highly praised actingfocused celebrity peers such as lee byunghun particularly his performance in another excellent revengefilm called i saw the devil,cruel
sad to say its a pretty bad movie do not watch it definitely does not deserve the high rating it gets on imdb there are better korean movies than this the problem with the movie for me might be that it is geared towards a preteen female audience there is nothing specialmemorable about the action sequences the story line is rather dulli did not find any of the characters to be likable the only positive i can think of is the main characters voice is very deep the whole purpose of the movie was to create a unstoppable hero this causes a problem in that it the movie loses suspense when we know that the main character is invincible the worst part of the movie has to be the forced attempt in making the protagonist as a cool guy this does not work the dude comes off as a model and for some unknown reason gets a haircut halfway through the movie i dont know what other bad things i can say about this movie,cruel
i like watching foreign films because quite frankly i get tired of the same tired actorsactresses playing the same characters in different films no matter how many times i see bruce willis he always seems to be john mcclain that is why i truly enjoyed brotherhood of the wolf and why i recommend watching this filma lot of other reviews mentioned how the plot is very similar to others but i feel it takes a different patha darker path much like 8mm and hostel this movie delves into the seedy underbelly of its environment our hero has chosen an area to disappear into where people seem to be lost and discarded without a second look even though the girl is not the cutest you find yourself sympathetic to her plight by the end you are literally wondering what else could happen to herthe hero tries hard to stay out of the chaos erupting around him but is drawn in deeper and deeper finally the only alternative is to simply jump into the pool with both feet and he does it with a vengeance the action sequences are awesome and even better believable more and more movies are trying to go over the top with their action sequences which tends to take away from the movie one reason i tend to shy away from asian films is because of the stupid fight sequences with people running across tree tops and flying at each other with swords these fight scenes reminded me more of the transporter serieseven though you find out that the hero is some military special forces guru you tend to believe in him because his character is unlike those from the same genre no big guns simply a pistol and knife no big transformation scene before the big fight simply a haircut i think it is the simplicity of the character that makes the movie greati noticed some people have trouble following the plot lines i have seen two versions of this filmone dubbed and one with subtitles i notice the plot varies a bit between the two and some of the lines are completely different watching both seemed to really put it all together i never understood the film title until i saw the subtitled versionso to wrap things up if you are an action film buff watch this movie there are a lot of cool action scenes as mentioned before in another review the follow shot out the window is awesome youll know it when you see it there are a few surprises too i have watched it three times and want to see it again,cruel
i saw this on dvd seeing that the film was invited to a few international film festivals boy it was all hype and gripe with me about this film its basically a cookiecutter action flick about some former spy who takes pity on an orphan girl who is kidnapped by gangsters i would think that in 2010 action movies would try to be a bit different than the norm but not in the man from nowhere the film is basically an excuse for won bin to be in a starring role that he is truly unfit for i mean come on hes just a pretty boy but not convincing as an action star and the plot and film are just repetition of what ive seen before in korean movies except for more action and goretrust me you do not need to see this film it is also very long at two hours and much of the footage was unnecessary save two hours of your life by skipping this dud,cruel
the man from nowhere a gruesome film written and directed by lee jeongbeom was very hard to watch at some parts however at other times this film made me feel somewhat emotional and very attached to the characters personally i did not appreciate the amount of fighting and violence within the film including lots of visual injuries and strikes however i did appreciate some of the beautiful relationships between certain characters in the film for example the relationship between the young girl kim chigon and her very kind nextdoor neighbor who decided to save her life cha taesik i would recommend this film to anyone who is not afraid of a little gore and violence and is interested in a thriller with a heartwarming background plot,cruel
i stumbled across this movie on netflix it had four stars so i decided to check it out it turned out to be an excellent decision this movie has it all great story fantastic acting well executed fight scenes and its funny moments it is hands down one of the best movies i have ever seen it won the korean version of the oscars for best male actor bin won who plays his part perfectlyit starts off at a club and the detectives are trying to get this criminal organization then jumps to the man character at his work and goes through pretty much a daily routine he owns a pawn shop at the apartments he lives at he befriends a little girl though by the way he treats her it seems like he doesnt care for her at all her mom happens to be a drug addict and stole from the wrong people they wind up kidnapping the mother and daughter and decide to use the main character chatae sik to send a message to another gang we soon find out that he used to be in a special military group and he puts his skills to usei did a very dimmed down version of about half of the movie it only gets better as it goes and the ending is superb brilliantly executed fight scene and a good ending to tie it all up this movie is somewhat similar to taken and man on fire but at the same time very different korean movies in general are pretty good but from what ive seen there are three that stand out the most this one oldboy and i saw the devil all amazing and oldboy is on the top 250 movies on imdb voted by users ive read other reviews that say the main character is somewhat invincible which is not true at all first off the military group he is in was said to be on of the most brutal trainings out there making congressmen faint from what they see he takes pain a much different way than a normal man would all in all you would have to watch the movie for yourself and believe me you will not waste your time watching it,cruel
even if i find somi you two are still deadpretty cool movie the man from nowhere is a south korean actionthriller of similar type to taken or the bourne flicks a dangerous man with a mysterious past gets caught up in a conflict with a group of criminals when a lonely young girl hes befriended is taken by them as he tracks her down we learn about his tragic past and see him put his deadly skills to use against some despicable lowlifesthe movie isnt perfect theres a lengthy period before the action starts that perhaps goes on a little too long and the dialogue at least the translated subtitles is occasionally hammy and unintentionally hilarious there are also a few too many blatant attempts to pull at the viewers heartstrings and force you to get emotionally invested in the story i always find that kind of thing to be a little annoyingso its a little derivative and it has some definite pacing problems but that doesnt stop the man from nowhere from being a movie worth checking out at its best pretty much the entire last act its an intense ride that fans of movies like taken will thoroughly enjoy bin won is believable and effective in the main role and the tidy and sure to please ending is a nice bookend for all the carnage,cruel
essentially a remake of man on fire and the professional but its very well done and if you liked those movies youll probably like this korean twist on them the tone is darker and the gore is heavier and more realistic so while this film is highly derivative it is much grittier than its obvious inspirations it feeds directly into the common male fantasy of possessing near superhuman abilities that no one around you knows about youre actually a deadly coiled snake waiting to strike yet to all outward appearances youre a worm just wait until they find out theyll live long enough to regret their misjudgment theyll pay for disrespecting you they have no idea who theyre messing with etc etc im a guy too and you know what im talking about dont bother denying itfirst cars now films korea has come a long way and is producing some top notch products although in this case not exhibiting much originality,cruel
the man from nowhere directed by jeongbeom lee is yet another example of how the south korean film industry has the market cornered on revenge thrillers despite featuring familiar a plot and character types both are sharper and a bit more selfindulgent than their american counterparts there is no conflicting vision to tone down the unhinged rage and violence the end result is unfiltered vengeance and bloodshed and undeniably thrilling while it may occasionally stretch its credibility from time to time it still boasts its share of welltimed surprises and always walks on the side of excess the relationship between our protagonist cha taesik played by bin won mother 2009 and somi played by child actress kim saeron is at the heart of the film and their bond slowly develops in the first half hour right before somi is abruptly kidnapped the rest of the film mainly focuses on chas efforts to find her having almost nothing to work with and with the police being more of a hindrance than a help we learn more about chas past as he gets closer to finding somi won bin delivers a grand performance as a highlyskilled fighter and is equally effective as an emotionally damaged vulnerable protagonist the more technical aspects of the filmproduction and cinematography are all executed with a great deal of skill the film does suffer somewhat from over complicating the story line and please enough already with clich inept police department that simply runs in circles and into each other it also does run a bit too long at times due to the overly melodramatic moments that simply drag on this korean action crime drama revels in its genres conventions a great thriller a nonstop adrenaline rush with plenty of impressive action sequences to carry one through its two hour run time the film does a decent job with character development and its backstory and the dramatic elements are admirable for an action film maybe someday american audiences will get to see the lighter side of korean cinema in the meantime theres no denying these powerful films of vengeance and revenge the man might be from nowhere but the movies could only come from korea,cruel
like toshiro mifune in yojimbo sanjuro etc or clint eastwood in a fistful of dollars for a few dollars more etc bin won in the man from nowhere is a man of few words also like mifune or eastwood in the aforementioned flicks his motivation is understandable some would argue even more so since bin wons motivation is the rescue of a little girl who reminds him that his own child was lost when his pregnant wife was murdered won looks almost like a quintessential anime character with the tall thin dapper look and the dangling hair perpetually draped over one eye not to mention the explosive violence that hes able to unleash on them as what needs explosive violence unleashed upon them if youre interested in exceptionally wellcrafted carnage with some real worldtype motivation thrown in for good measure check out the man from nowhere,cruel
2019 watched movie after reading reviews im glad i did it was very entertaining ,cruel
from watching the trailer for the man from nowhere my immediate vibe was leon the professional meets taken and although reviews here state the man from nowhere is its own identity after watching the film i think comparison to these two films is fair if you have watched both leon the professional and taken you will have a very good idea of the tone the themes and the kind of highly competent violence in the man from nowhereunkempt stoic child molester vibe pawnshop owner cha taesik has a parentlike relationship with his young neighbor jeong somi very much like as in leon the professional the character cha taesik i think is not as developed as leon though and neither is the young girl but even so the relationship feels genuine and the bond believable enough to carry the filmi would say cha taesiks martial art skill set background is not really as believable as liam neesons character in taken like i mean cha taesik is phenomenal in his movements but the reason why he is in such stellar shape having a six pack as a pawnshop broker is less believable while a retired special operative like cha taesik liam neesons character was shown to be a bodyguard theres a bit of suspension of belief in regards to cha taesiks character that does impact my rating of the film although i found these aspects easy to overlook as i consumed the great action sequencesi did feel that there were other parts of the film that did ask me to just kind of go along with it like the whole thing with the cops was a bit extraneous and like why were they even mad didnt even seem like they were mad at the organ harvesters and just at cha taesik for busting up some cops i felt like the cops couldve played either a lesser role or a more integral role to the story at some point the cop characters and the druglordorgan harvester characters just seemed to run into each other because of their similar personalities serious bossfunny sidekickbut like overlooking the extra parts and the gaps the man from nowhere does have serious heart here the feeling is very much like taken such as one man going against a very large apathetic organization i do think taken goes one step farther than the man from nowhere because it shows how the cops involved also aid the problem of human trafficking if the man from nowhere had done that i think its themes wouldve been strongeranyhow if you are going to make a film that takes its inspiration from other films then the man from nowhere is how to do it i did enjoy the message it tried to get across and i also found some moments of humor in it too in the last minutes cha taesik says something brooding and enigmatic to jeong somi and she simply asks whats that supposed to mean i do think that cha taesik did sort of say nonsensical things at times with the druglord not understanding it was kind of funny because its a bit of a cliche in asian films i thinkanyway the kind of activities the criminals do in the man from nowhere is genuinely despicable but the characters have this balance between being utter pieces of work and then like total children so theres a weird likability to the villains even though because of how destroyed they get you understand their actions are unacceptable and as it should be the man from nowhere is at once hyperbolic and absolutely serious and even poignant which is what i think differentiates it from the other two films mentioned i think the man from nowhere is closer in tone to leon the professional rather than taken because its not as gritty or realistic as the latter in terms of plot though the man from nowhere is much more inclined towards taken since it is less a relationship film than a rescue filmi thoroughly recommendi do want to mention one thing though that confused me for a great length of time a character meets jeong somis mom in the first few minutes of the film the character has the same hairstyle and build as cha taesik so i thought it was him and was trying to make this bit of background fit for the rest of the film finally i figured out cha taesik had no relationship with the mom so he was really the man from nowhere rather than the man from a few minutes before it appears im the only one who made this mistake but honestly i think the beginning of the film is relatively weak since it doesnt spotlight or foil important characters they should have started with cha taesik or something,cruel
where to startthe story is dull a mysterious man who is more than he appears goes on to defend the poor daughter of a drug addict that is abducted by the mafia this movie is a caricature of leon drive and john wick which is itself a caricature of lonesome hero movieswhat makes it worse is that they overuse dramatic events to make the drama surrounding the story more intense they made the little girl as sad as possible by inflicting her with the worst this world has to offer so much so that it becomes a joke the main actor is coming straight from the dreams of a 12 year old girl he is as unsubstantial as it gets with the charisma of a perished oyster with his impeccable abs and 100 pounds of bodyweight he will take headon about 16 bandits armed with guns with his bare hands because yes its that simple to make an action movie nowadayslet me save you the time that i have lost forever watching this movie by telling you that you will regret watching this garbage unless this is the first action movie youre about to see and youre a 12 yearold girl,cruel
while dark and violent this movie also has a certain charm mainly due to the painfully touching and charming little girl who befriends a pawnbroker who turns out to be more than he appears somewhat predictable and sometimes a bit overthetop in its grim bonecrunching violence this movie is also wellpaced and is manipulative in a good wayworth watching,cruel
one of the things they did was to give this movie a smooth translation without having the characters have oriental accents china is competing with korea for drugs the koreans set up a deal with the chinese for them to sample their wares the heroin gets stolen by a dancerdruggie who has a daughter her neighbor is a mysterious loner who operates a small time pawn shop he and the daughter become semifriends perhaps the best way to describe it the korean dea is also on the case they bad guys catch up with the dancer and kidnap her and the kid the pawn shop owner gets dragged into the mess as it turned out they picked on the wrong guy he goes walking tall to rescue the girlthe movie has one corpse nudity scene some groping and needless mf and fbombs the movie is straight forward action one scene is a little awkward where there is a chinese translator a man would say something in english and then the translator would then say it in english also just one of those foreign movie things,cruel
this movie has it all excellent plot and extremely excellent acting i was very impressed plus a nice ending some people might say a little gory but really not that bad at all actually probably just the right amount of blood and guts for those that need itlol,cruel
this is a fine movie that has both powerful action scenes and intensely emotional moments on many themes won bin is a superb actor who can develop his character more through his eyes and the quiet play of emotions across his face than most actors can do even with training what won bin does cant be taught its a gift it is also won bins last film before leaving the entertainment business 10 years ago ive read that he left at the height of his career to focus on his personal life marriage and child i have also read that he has become a mutimillionaire from doing cf and modelingboth of which im guessing are not as draining as acting in brilliant films that win lots of awardsespecially when the star is as good as won bin still i join the chorus of voices that would love to see him in another film when and if he chooses to do so,cruel
im not particuliary fan of the asan action mviesbut i saw that movie a few days ago and i still think about it loved so much the main caracters are very well defined and the girl is gorgeous i recommended  for me is the best asan movie i ever seen so pity the principal actor doesnt have done practicly nothing after that because he is so amazing,cruel
hes not an excon please fix your description imbd,cruel
man those koreansthey know cinema wish there were more available to usthe man from nowhere isnt the most original movie but its thoroughly interesting twisting and has heart oh and some kickass actiona pawn star to his little girl neighbor is thrust into the crime world apparently again when said girl is kidnapped and sold into slavery just think an animetakenyes i know this isnt japanese but i did see so much liveaction anime here especially the lead pawnshop guy with hair over one eye for half the feature its nowhere near the top of the best of korean cinema but its absolutely worth it when it gets going its either hilarious actionpacked or unbelievable where they go watch itfinal thoughts helps there were soooo many good looking asian men can never have too many of those to see for two hours,cruel
this film is so amazing  good story a lot of action the actors are greati loved it,cruel
i am a great luc besson fan but this is the film that leon  the professional aspires to the story is told in a restrained and logical fashion it is gory and gritty but as appropriate to the genrea warning to the faint hearted however it is brutal in the action scenes not gratuitous like peckinpah but still chillingly graphic its gore and grit are very appropriate to this genrei was prepared for a light illogical action flick and got a layered story with superb acting the cinematography was top notchthe police and the evil henchmen are cardboard mockups of characters which helps the viewer detach from worst of the carnage this is high on my watch again list,cruel
the heros development through the story to the end perfectly matched the title it wasnt because he was mysterious it was the fact he was the girls neighbor you dont see how much he cared for the girl until the finale he was a strangertechnically due to him a the girls relationship in the beginning that helped another he was almost like the star from the movieredemption  a hero who fell off but crawled out of itthe villians werent dumb they were an actual threat to other people around themthe license plate scene and the ruffied girlthe bad guy were just really caught off guard which is understandable because they were dealing with someone they know nothing about and underestimated they were even evil to the point that their brutal deaths gave the feel they deserved it the use of ants was even new to me as well this showed these werent the usual drug traffickers you hear aboutthe fight scenes were used well the first fight the hero had being the tip of the iceberg of what the final fight would finally be the brutality matched the emotions and situations from self defense survival and to pure rage unlike most fighting movies who has fights in every scene this actually made the wait worth it,cruel
the direction is astonishing and the cinematography is gripping enough to keep our eyes on the screen the film does an effortless job of building tension and discomfort when need be making the scenes of violence and revenge all the more gratifying the violent scenes do exhibit blood prepare for a lot of stabbing but its used sparingly enough that the film isnt in danger as being classified as shock gore,cruel
the man from nowhere lives in a pawnshop next to a mother and daughter he is a withdrawn man with no relationships and tries to keep to himself however he forms a bond with a young girl over the time they spend time together he develops a soft spot for her but then she was abducted and her mother was killed the man from nowhere goes on a quest to get her back i really enjoyed the movie the man from nowhere it had great plot development and a wonderful storyline you really got to see the characters deepen throughout the movie you learned that the man from nowhere wasnt always so dark this was one of the most interesting parts of the movie to me to find out he had a wife but not just a wife a pregnant wife that died was heart breaking to me but it really explained his character it showed why he was so scared to form connections he was just scared of getting hurt again it also had a great ending i was very much expecting for the little girl to be dead but everything worked out okay in the end although he might go to jail she was alive and thats all that mattered to me,cruel
cha tae sik is the man from nowhere and is a introvert special ops agent who has been running a pawn shop for years a young girl somi tries to befriend him but he does not confide in her presence but little does he know that her mom is a stripper and is not much of a father figure to somi furthermore the chinese mafia and south korean gangs trade drugs and tapper with organ harvesting somis mother takes heroin from the gang and they both get kidnapped for messing with the wrong people hence chatae sik tries to save them moreover the korean gang calls chatae sik in order to settle a dispute against the chinese mafia and if he does this chatae sik will receive somi and her mother back safely however chae tae sik is deceived and the koreans kill the mother anyways and harvest her organs for sale and turn her daughter into a drug ant child drug trafficking that is why i love this film so much because it does not sugar coat anything or give anybody the hollywood hope that is really looking for it exploits the raw and cruel nature of humans using others to their advantage and not caring a growing number of south koreans are turning to the illegal websites and black markets to advertise the sale of their organs in order to overcome financial challenges and or debt furthermore police are batting an eye away from the illegal organ harvesting and illegal organ trafficking is clearly on the rise arrests relating to the practice have decreased showing an unwillingness on the part of police authorities to crack down on the problem along with economic hardship lack of donors in the country is also contributing to the rise in illegal organ trafficking because the dependent population of men and women is so high men and women ages 16  64 there is a lack of organ donors to support those in the home country of south korea since the youth population is so small thought provoking question what would you do if someone offered to give you 50000000 dollars for your organ knowing that your chances of survival are low due to the organ you are giving up is a vital organ the helps you function with your everyday activities,cruel
the film the man from nowhere is a really good film it showed that people arent always as they seem the main character cha taeshik was known as the creepy quiet neighbor and pawnshop keeper that people thought would rape young children he becomes fond of his nextdoor neighbor somi at the beginning of the film somis mother steals drugs from a drug trafficking organization this causes somi and cha taeshik to get involved the drug traffickers kidnap somi and her mother hyojeong throughout the film we see cha taeshik take many risks to get somi back and to make sure she remains alive he puts himself in major danger to save the one person he really cares about he fights to save somi from her kidnappers this shows that he isnt as he seems he is actually a kind caring person that wants to protect a young girl,cruel
movie the man from nowhere 18rating 455since i saw the films indian remake first and enjoyed it as well i will write just a brief review as most of the praise has come out in the review of the remake rocky handsomethe man from nowhere is one of the best south korean action films as it provides great action while also combining it will emotions and thrills the film is full of scenes that have gone down into the filmmaking history as classic since i already knew the entire story due to having seen the remake i wasnt surprised but was still very impressed won bin is a perfect actor and his performance will make you remember him for long kim hee won is decent and plays his part well kim saeron is quite decent in the role provided same for rest of the castthe action as i said before is great what i didnt mention is that its dynamite in impactlee jeongbeoms the man from nowhere is undoubtedly a smart action film which is entertaining of course but also quite different from most action films,cruel
for me there are a bunch of films that leave an impression later after soaking in the scenes and pondering on them for a while most of blockbuster films usually have one or more notes that comes off wrong and ruins the entire orchestra leaving a bad taste and wishing i could just forget it forever some films have less spikes and are easier to watch without getting overtly jolted some really have a nice overall tune that i would probably go as far to say i would purchase the bluray film to support the creators then there are some really well made films that fit the bill perfectly and even surprise when you least expect it yup you guessed this film is just great from beginning to end the highlights are the realistic fighting scenes that use real world gravity and the camera shots that are crystal clear the film is raw and exposes real world problems like drugs prostitution and child exploitation would be a 1010 but in reality its a 9510 due to the extreme violence that our hero retorts to for immediate justice also the hero persona more than likely caters to an asian market while in the west it may seem different overall this film needs to be played in theaters and needs some awards so that a wider audience may praise it and we may all be jolly in agreement,cruel
there are many action movies with action star and his friend who goes missing our hero in turn goes as one man army for the rescue of the friendly counterpart well the movies come to our mind are leon man on fire and takenthis movie however impresses me the most the reason is its cinematography and emotional take in its execution also unlike many action movies the action does not seem unrealmany reviewers were unhappy about the plot being complex according to me this may be because movie is korean my view is its not at all compound just that the language is something that we are not use toremake rocky handsome of this movie in bollywood nowhere stands near original,cruel
i stumbled onto this film because of insomnia amc used it as filler about 330am on a weeknight and i was mightily impressed extremely highquality movie all the way around and it takes its time building up a big head of steam then it delivers a deeply satisfying and emotionally moving payoff the only problem it has and several reviewers commented on this is the complexity of the plot and all the different characters intertwining and converging this is really only an issue because of the language barrier and it is difficult to read the subtitles and also keep track of the many characters and plot points at the same time so i bought my own dvd it was cheap and i was able to easily untangle the whole story the dvd also has a dubbedin english version if anyone is so inclined believe me the entire script is quite intelligent and very logical and it all fits together seamlessly once you catch on spoiler alert for example some reviewers couldnt figure out how somi was spared near the end ramrowan had a private sense of warriors honor or the samurai code or whatever you want to call it in him the whole time and he adored somi despite himself so he ended up killing the surgeon at the very last instant and cutting his eyes out instead of letting the surgeon cut somis eyes out he also couldve easily shot cha taeshik during the climactic battle scene but he believed it wouldve been a great dishonor if he and cha taeshik didnt settle matters mantomananyway this is one of the very finest onemanarmy revenge films that youll find anywhere i put it right up there with denzel washingtons man on fire its that good,cruel
the man from nowhere directed by lee jungbeom completely blew my expectations away going into the movie i was a little biased as an american that held a false global perspective i imagined that since this movie was produced in korea that it would not be as professional nor good as an american movie i also thought the language barrier would make the movie even more unappealing i was completely wrong this movie is one of the best movies i have ever watched the language barrier was nonexistent for it was fixed with subtitles and the annoyance was never apparent because the movie was too good the director portrayed the main character as a quite mysterious person who owns a pawn shop and lee later develops the characters backstory throughout the movie as people investigate him the ties between family and the pawn shop owners past are discovered and bring emotion into the film after his neighbor and her daughter who he has formed a connection with are taken by drug lords he attempts to save them while dodging the dea after being set up by the captor of his neighbors to fighting multiple villains we watch our main character a juggernaut as he dispenses of as many enemies as it will take to find his neighbor and her daughter eventually he manages to pinpoint the head villains and take them down one by one the ending of the last fight scene which i wont spoil is extremely satisfying and a giant relief and makes this movie even better this movie deserve a tenoutoften rating because it was incredibly enjoyable to watch and was well directed,cruel
the man from nowhere was one of the best films that i have watched this year not only was it a well put together action movie but there was also a little comedy thrown in to help spice things up it was also interesting to see how they placed the story from different perspectives as well i really enjoyed looking at things from the deas perspective as well as somis perspective one thing that did confuse me about this film was both the presence and lack of guns it seemed like all of the police were able to obtain guns and at one point so was the main character however almost no one in the drug ring had guns and when they did it was only for specific parts i dont know if thats coming from an united states perspective where guns are plenty around here but it seemed like there wasnt as many as there could have been everything else about the movie was fantastic especially the fighting sequences,cruel
this was a very intense movie to watch it had many exciting elements to it as well as many sad moments the story follows a man named cha tae shik he served as part of a special operations unit in the military and went completely under the radar after the death of his wife the only people he has left are a drug abusive dancer and her little daughter who is only a toddler when a south korean gang takes the mother and kills her to fuel their black market organ trade they take her daughter as hostage cha tae shik wont stop until he gets the dancers daughter back in the meantime the cops are also going after the gang members but they get needlessly distracted with shik this movie had many intense action scenes in it it was petty easy to watch at some points but at others it became very hard for example when the garbage truck slammed into shiks car killing his wife and unborn baby or when the trunk of one of the gangs cars is popped open revealing the dead harvested body of the mother one of my favorite scenes was in the end after cha tae shik had killed all of the bad guys and was in the parking lot out of the dark came the daughter in good health and ran towards him this relieved basically all of the suspense and tension that nearly the entire movie had built up i also noticed how clever some of the camera angles were my favorite was when shik was running into the subway station as he entered it was raining and the camera was facing down as the water droplets fell away from the viewer it created a very cool effect in my opinion,cruel
i liked the movie and the actions scenes were entertaining the main character cha tae sik has a sad make story and that is why i feel he wanted to save somi a little girl and his only friend however there was a big plot hole in the story there was a scene they put somi to sleep with drugs and it looks as if they are about to remove her eyes but they later showed us that they removed someone elses eyes even though i was happy to see her alive i was upset to how somi was conveniently free with no one else around her at the moment cha taesik was about to kill him self though the movie is already two hours long i felt that they could have made it a little longer to explain how somi got free,cruel
the movie the man from nowhere is one of the best movies i have seen in the past year that has to do with a foreign film i guess it had something to do with all of the action but i just really enjoyed watching it there are a few moments where you have to think about it and try to come to a reality where something would actually take place yet due to the main characters past and everything that he has gone through it is really hard to tell just why he does everything that he does to start it off i will go with the relationship between the man and the prostitutes daughter there will be many spoilers but to carry on with my point there are many different reasons for why the man chases after the girl after she is taken away due to her mothers involvement with the drug ring is south korea etc anyway i believe he does this due to the loss of his daughter and his wife as they were taken away so abruptly he never had a chance to save them yet now he actually does have a chance to save the little girl that he somewhat sees his wifedaughter in despite this the movie puts a view on the trafficking of body parts and the use of children as no one would suspect a child to do anything harmful they use this to their edge and due to that it is a huge problem this movie is a 9 out of 10 i would recommend anyone watches it,cruel
the man from nowhere was a great movie in my opinion following a great story line that also included chaotic yet easy to follow fight scenes the backstory behind the main character was touching but not so different to be unrelatable cha was a former special agent so he uses his unique set of combat skills in order to save his neighbor who has been kidnapped since chas pregnant wife was killed because of his line of work he always felt responsible cha feels the same way in this situation because he was not given the opportunity to raise a daughter before so he wants to do so now this film uses great cinematography especially with the closeups of chas hand with the fingernail polish on it another aspect that i enjoyed about this movie was chas motive for fighting at first he was just in it to save his neighbor and her mother once he finds out that they killed the mother and took her organs when he was set up he decides that it is his mission to take out the organization behind it then when cha realizes that the organization is using children as slaves to make and deliver drugs and stealing the organs of innocent people he then makes it his mission to kill everyone involved in these crimes overall this film provided an entertaining tearjerking action packed rollercoaster that i would suggest to anyone willing to watch a foreign movie,cruel
i really liked the film the man from nowhere i liked the amount of action and the main plot the story was based on a man who gets attached to a young girl and then fights to find her when she is kidnapped the film had a lot of good action and fighting scenes i also liked that you grew attached to the characters throughout the film as you learned their life stories i also enjoyed all the different types of good and bad guys i did not like all the gore if you are someone who isnt able to handle bloody sciences i would skip out on this movie i believe that even though the movie was not in english it was easy to understand and follow it was a well rounded movie that i would recommend,cruel
overall this was a great film that i would definitely recommend to watch in the beginning of the film i thought that the pacing went kind of slow but my perspective on the film started to change while getting more into it the main character in the film owned a pawnshop and met a young girl when she came to his shop the owner of the pawnshop taesik cha became close with the young girl when he noticed the danger that she and her mother were in taesik cha had a secret dark past which eventually effects the way he behaves the little girls mother and the girl one day get taken away by some people who are involved with drug violence and cutting people open and selling their organs illegally taesik cha wanted to save the little girl and her mother and was able to save the girl but unfortunately the mother perished the little girl in the film sees taesik cha as her own father but has troubles realizing if he will save her or not but he is able to defeat the bad guys and save himself and the little girl there was a lot of violence in the film but most american films are violent so this could be an issue to some i liked how the movie was filmed and how it showed some parts of the film as if one was actually in it but the only down part of this film is that most of the time i was very confused why certain things happened which was never explained in the film and therefore i would give this film a 45,cruel
the man from nowhere is a crazy movie in the sense of all the gory scenes and intense themes throughout the film i really liked the main character taesik cha he seemed very complex and mysterious at the beginning of the film as the viewers learned more about him i began to like him more because of the way he handled his past and the situations at the present his determined search to find avenge and eventually save the little girl who is his neighbor is honorable and very sweet i enjoyed the complex plot of this film however i found myself cringing throughout the movie due to the extreme blood and violence present during the whole movie the various groups of people involved in the plot was a bit confusing but i think the director did a good job making it clear who belonged to which group and each of their relations to each other as the movie continued overall i would say that i liked the movie especially the main character however it contained a bit more violence and gore than i would typically like to witness i would give this film 355 stars,cruel
this movie has become one of my favorites its so well doneit was such a pleasant surprise sometimes i watch the ending again both for the action and for the emotional impact its just so well done bravoi especially like the dynamic between the protagonist and the vietnamese rival he keeps having to fight overtime you can really see how the vietnamese guy grows more and more respect for his opponent until it becomes full blown awe the crescendo of the rivals own inner conflict has such a perfect pace and reaches its peak so perfectly that its almost beautiful,cruel
the story and plot is very simple a man randomly helping a girl out yet it shows love and deep compassion which really makes a difference compared to other movies it brings out the true nature of human chemistry it is very mysterious as well it keeps you thinking during the whole movieaction in this movie is the best of korean cinema of course hollywood has a bigger budget that is why i give credit to korea still on a lower budget they made an excellent movie the style of action and fighting stands out it shows intense but realistic fighting scenes a lot of people leave movies wondering how did they fight like that it doesnt make sense the action was confusing there was nothing wrong with this movie it was just flawless the movie taken is very similar to this movie with the story and plot just watch and enjoy,cruel
not a particular fan of korean movies i decided to give this one a try after a friends suggestion i must say what a surprize the pacing was good though its a bit slower than movies in the same genre the main actor gave a convincing performance with minimalist dialogues he doesnt say much and his haircut hides half of his face yet his presence is felt with impactthe plot unfolds bit by bit and keeps us breathing tight till the very endthe action sequences were convincing from the fist fights to gun fights and one excellent knife fight towards the end i highly recommend this one,cruel
the man from nowhere is an intense movie with more then just enough of the blood very well edited and marvelously acted movie however its kind of movie which would have worked better with lesser of the words at times it felt very expressive especially when characters would express their emotions using words the title lost its justification somewhere between those dialogues which brought him form nowhere into open book category fight sequences are intense and very well choreographed cinematography is good too writing could have been little better thoughgenerally a good revengechase movie,cruel
for many years now i stayed away from the japanesekung fu flicks because they dont make them like they used to but i was super blown away by this film  they had two main characters i actually cared about the fight action sequences is probably some of the best i seen in a very long time im almost certain they put tons of work into hence the reason it came across so well the plot itself wasnt hard to follow but wasnt a clich revenge plot as well now their are a few things i didnt like about this film which happens but this was things that stood out immediately 1 he shouldve died plenty of times but of course i understand hes the hero of it all but it started to make him look like a cat with nine lives 2 the little girl shouldve died as well it made no sense whatsoever that she made it out unscathed when the boss gave the order who saved her why the sudden change of heart theyve been doing it for years what made her so special all in all the film was enjoyable than i thought  i more than likely will watch it a second time,cruel
with exception of the final 15 min or so of its runtime i thought the man from nowhere was quite entertaining yes it has a few annoying qualities  namely one that its music and score sometimes just dont match the images and two one of those ridiculous fight scenes where one character singlehandedly manages to kill 20 thugs at once so you might ask whats good well some very crisp and well cut fight choreographies including major spoiler a tense welldone knife fight scene and surprisingly whats good is the core actors forged friendship  one that is paved well in the first 20 min or so of the movie i enjoyed the child actress well this is an entertaining movie despite its small weaknesses,cruel
i dont even know how i got to see this movie but it is now in my collection and i tell people to watch it all the time i have seen it many times over as the story line acting is impressive both the little girl played by saeron kim and the main character played by bin won gave extraordinary performances i now love korean movies from watching this to see the connection with the main characters was a delight and heart warming to watch as an action movie junkie i was not disappointed and unlike most western style or modern action movie the main character got hurt spoiler warning this movie gives me hope for humanity to see someone who completely detached from the worldheart melt by interacting with a someone else who wasnt even trying to change him i would love to see a sequel to this movie as i didnt want it to end i cannot say enough about this movie and how great the acting characters and action was very rare to get all three in a movie now a days also watch the making of the movie as it proves you can make an amazing movie without a big studio budget i cannot believe they made this movie for what they made it for talent director writer and actors i want to see more of these characters writer and directors,cruel
for the most part i found this movie very enjoyable some tightly created action sequences visually appealing cinematography lots of different characters and settings to keep the senses amused the film moves along at a good pace and features some disturbing scenes and effective use of gore to satisfy a sadistic film watcher like myself fighting scenes are sharp and not overly drawn out and the performance by the young girl who plays somi pulls on the heart strings and is probably the most impressive acting performance in the movie yes the entire cast may have been out acted by a 10 year oldthose are the good things a little while into the movies plot there is a strong sense of dejavu as every other action movie come flooding back to you as another reviewer said this movie would be great if you hadnt seen an action thriller for the last 20 years it is extremely formulaic and the ending is straight from the 90s hollywood vein of cheesy endings i may given this movie a solid 7 had they not gone down the sparkly gooey happy ending route which i found was an awkward contrast to 15 hours of brutality which preceded it good fun if you are an action enthusiast and not too concerned about original ideas,cruel
if youre looking for action looking for brutal violence and a mesmerizing story linethe man from nowhere has what you seek cha taesikbin won is a man of mystery he is a mild mannered pawn shop owner that comes to the rescue of a young girl that has been kidnapped by a ruthless gang of drug runners the girls mother happens to owe a large sum of money and these vicious and nasty criminals are bargaining a rough trade taesik feels compassion for the girl and after being framed by the kidnappers he will enter kickass mode to save his young admirer and seek justice the action is high octane and the violence is brutal and combustible not for the faintofheart this flick seems hellbent on grabbing you and not letting go its like a train wreckyou just cant stop gawking other players include saeron kim jongpik lee taehoon kim and do won kwak you will want to watch again just for the hell of it,cruel
wow braver then taken and safe the atmospheric back streets of seoul and the depiction of korean low life brought to life on the screen the reality of another world acting superb believable characters beautiful child actressand lead parts gruesome at times but true to the brutality of crime reflected modern korean attitudes to perfection its plot is believable and moves along at a fast pace in a logical pattern direction taut and dark shots down the back alleys of the criminal under belly add to the atmosphere i didnt leave my seat for the whole length of the movie which is a marker of a good movie watched at home it would spoil the films place in action crime movies if a sequel was made as it has made all the statements for and against drugs child abuse trafficking and murder,cruel
wow this movie was on the money i was referred to view this movie and was absolutely blown away by this gem the movie hits on all points the story although not unique is well written dialogue is somehwat limited at times but matches the emotion of the movie the acting feels real and the action sequences are spot on no fluff found here the producers bring it to you the scenery gives you the feeling of the grimy streets and run down nature of the area it takes place in the main character shows much emotional baggage as he attempts to stay away from the organized crime that hes getting pulled into the girl he protects makes you feel sad and angry as she gets pulled around by the bad fellas,cruel
this is a really good movie  one that every adult should see regardless of whether or not they have enjoyed foreignsubtitled films in the pastthe actors do a fantastic job of selling characters without a whole lot of meaningful dialogue the little girl is fantastic my wifes reaction wasi wish they had child actors like that here in the states she was that good the lead is great as well and extremely believable as an exhighlevel secret agentthere were other characteristics that really strengthened this filmthe action sequences are spectacular and this wasnt a bigbudget filmin that way it reminded me of equilibrium the fight scenes are well choreographed but not too overthetop i really dug the fact that this film didnt have to rely on either the action or the storyline to carry the weight  it was wellbalanced  the quality of the acting and the production on the whole in a word impressive it wasnt some overblown action film with serious lapses in other areas eitherb13 ultimatum comes to mind all involved deserve gigantic props for putting their heart and soul into this project there must have been some experience behind the camera toothe director did a good job piecing this thing together without it coming off as choppy or rushedthe music is good and meshes with the storylinehighly recommended this now sits there with some of my other favorite far east filmsfive deadly venoms fulltime killer crouching tiger the host iron monkey oldboy seven samurai cj7 tekkon kinkreet spirited away house of the flying daggers infernal affairs a better tomorrow etcit has a bighearted appealtypical of many korean or chinese films mixed with the action storylinealso typicalalthough mixing the two not so much and it just works this films popularity will only grow over the next few months following its us dvd release i told the video store owner i was interested in buying his only copy after he rented it out for a couple months maybe that way more people might grab this off the shelf and enjoy it before i add it to my collection with all the crap thats been in the new release section lately  you should move this to the top of your list  immediatelyyoull like this if you liked equilibrium infernal affairs oldboy or taken86100,cruel
though it lacks the original idea the man from nowhere is still an acceptable action pack that would satisfy fans of this genre the storyline itself isnt far and quite similar from some onemanshow movies like leon the professional and taken it also has silly and questionable theme about how a stranger would risk his life to save a next door child thankfully the movie never gets me bored its brutal violence and some bloody action sequences that make the man from nowhere enjoyable to see and far from safe its just satisfying to see the way taeshik punished the bad guy after some immoral acts theyve done a cool central performance from won bin is also the positive side that has lifted this thriller from just being ordinary perhaps the movie wont mark in mind like other dark thriller from south korea but overall it still got some styles to be amusing,cruel
the general rating of 79 is completely misleading it is a badly composed story mainly consisting of raw brutality knifes varnished with asian emotional stereotypes revenge submission inability to express feelings the subject is entirely sad drugs mafia organ trade of children we get to know korea as a dirty living conditions consumeoriented plastic everywhere luxury goods and extremely unequal country out of state control if this is asia i know why i never want to go there nothing more to say to this entirely dark film which can not even be lit up by the rare smile of the child actress which is nevertheless playing the most authentic role,cruel
here we have a movie similar to tony scotts man on fire with its concept and story with a bit of jason bourne thrown into it as well with as an extra tipping on top of it the fact that its korean seriously by saying this im sure of it that that there are dozens of people already wanting to rush out and find this movie and yes you should since its a good movie in its sort though its definitely not without its flaws and weaknessesthe way i look at these south korean genre movies they are like the best combination thinkable of japanese chinese and hong kong flicks they have the style and class of japanse production and the more overthetop and crazy elements as some violence filled chinese and hong kong action flicks but having said that this movie is not as crazy and overthetop as you might expect its actually one that tries to be more realistic with its story and approach which makes it a bit all the more a shame that the movie looses some of its credibility and power when its being oversentimental with its drama no the movie is definitely not without its flaws and weaknesses and i would had actually preferred it as well if the movie was even more raw and straightforward with its story and violence you could tell that this movie was also more or less inspired by john woos style im talking about his early hong kong movies as well but not enough really im convinced of it that if this movie indeed got done by john woo himself it would had been a better as well as a far more awesome onebut obviously it doesnt hurt the movie that badly since its still a more than great watch especially when you look at this movie in its context and within its genre its definitely one of the better ones of recent years it has a great simplistic revenge type of plot line in which you care about the main character and his motivations despite him not being necessarily a good guy himself it also means that the movie can afford to have plenty of action and violence in it and let its main character do some pretty brutal stuff to the real villains of the movieit overall is a well made film especially when considering that this was only jeongbeom lees second movie as a director despite it not being a perfect movie though far from it really but you sort of tend to forgive the movie for all of its weaknesses since its a movie that still does so much right and above all things succeeds to entertain with its action and there is plenty of well shot action to enjoy in this that keeps the movie fast going at all times as well it besides features some good solid characters in it that make the movie work out even betterdefinitely recommendable especially when youre into these modern korean action type of flicks810 httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,cruel
if you liked oldboy youll like this filmi hated oldboy if thats any indicator of how i felt about the man from nowhere i think some of the korean directors are going for distinction in the cruelest of asians category judging from the content of many recent films from korea and frankly i worry about sharing the planet with the people who have given this movie rave reviews and high rating numbersthis film is excessively violent and graphic and i just could not watch the final moments im already concerned that some of the images might stick unwanted in my memorythat said the lead actor bin won who was brilliant in tae guk gi in 2004 and the little girl who played some turned in awesome performances where do they find these brilliant children this little scamp will tear your heart out just as she did for her neighbor in the filmi think what really bothers me about films like this is that threatening to commit the kind of cruelties they carry out here would be sufficient instead nothing is left to the imagination which is frightening enough its all played out in very gory fashionjust want to warn you if youre a lover and not a sadistic fighter,cruel
all the characters were written in a very basic manner  no one stops to make logical decisions people on similar sides of the conflict dont communicate which may make the movie more dramatic but instead l was left bewildered at why people were doing what they were doingon the plus side the acting was really good  especially the daughter so mi and the main character,cruel
i was looking at some movies in the list top 50 favorite south korean movies and i saw this onei absolutely loved it the story was amazing the acting was done really well and i actually had to shed a tear at the end ive watched quite some korean movies now and this is one of my favorites if you have the time please watch itit also makes you wonder if stuff like this is still happening in underground korea its a really scary thought to be honestif you like korean movies i recommend to go and watch old boy and the chaser those were amazing too in my opinion furthermore if you are into horror movies koreans make really awesome and mostly totally effed up horrorflicks haha,cruel
the entire plot seems to closely follow lon the professionals vibe there are elements that are more in tune with the korean culture such as the element of ajeosshi  older male and the affection that sometimes forms in the culture among elders and younger people without any of the connotation that other cultures might try to portray when such a relationship is developed for an actor like won bin whom i had thought of as just a pretty face this has definitely marked a jump in his performancehowever the drug making child labor was not so convincing as drugs in korea are rarely dealt,cruel
this movie will take all the oscars prizes if it made from hollywood but the life isnt fair this is my review  the movie story  spoiler operating a pawn shop in a small neighborhood the nonsociable cha taesik won bin now leads a quiet life his only connection to the rest of the world is a little girl somi who lives next door somis mother hyo jeong is a heroin addict who steals drugs from a feared organized crime group she pawns her camera bag to taesik he does not realize it has the stolen drugs inside when a powerful crime lord finds out about the gangs stolen drugs orders his associate and subordinate manseok to retrieve the drugs when manseoks henchmen find out where the drugs are by torturing hyojeong they proceed to kidnap her and her daughter three gang members are sent to taesiks pawn shop to retrieve the stolen drugs but they are easily overpowered by taesik however upon learning that the gang now has in their possession both hyojeong and somi taesik gives the beaten gang members the camera bag and its contents,cruel
this movie is absolutely amazingi enjoyed every second of itespecially the emotional scenesim saying that because it was different than other fighting korean movies by the fact it had a few fighting scenesthat werent so long to start and bore meand the fighting part at the end was so well done that you could hardly tell it was fake you will be so impressed with a knife fight as never seen before  i loved the fact that the characters were outlinedjust like the storythe directorwriter was so focused on the story and the main character that you can actually lose yourself in the script  sorry for my english and lack of writing reviewsbut im not very good at it  the man from nowhere is a must watch for everybodyyou wont regret it,cruel
in broad generalities the movie has a lot in common with leon the professional 1994 one of jean reno  gary oldmans great films there are of course significant differences leon was a mafia hit man by training the man from nowhere has a murky past that the police must uncover leon was a gun for hire the man from nowhere was not but both sought to protect and help the young daughter of their neighbor who is swept up in trouble of course leon deals with corrupt ny police played fabulously by gary oldman and the man from nowhere a wide variety of japanese gangstersthe man from nowhere is quite violent but the black hats have it coming they deal in drugs heroin meth and body parts so it is easy to feel that they all get what they deserve except for the closing confrontation the violence is actually rather muted and the number of bodies restrained what makes this movie enjoyable is that the hero is a sad and troubled soul but for reasons that likely reflect the sad untimely death of his significant other he decides to save his 5 year old neighbor even though her mother is a less desirable member of society how very unjapanese but then he is not japanese reflecting a subtle reality of japanese culture and discrimination the man from nowhere is chinese and thus subject to the usual rampant discrimination that japan has for all nonjapaneseone of the interesting subplots is the way various gangster organizations set each other up as they compete for a share of the underworld pie these are not nice people though there appears to be a puzzling absence of traditional yakuza from the movie plenty of yakuza want to bes though the gangs are of course replete with incompetent sadists all the more deserving of a vengeful death the chief police inspector is a persistent and joyously optimistic soul who does his duty in an efficient and relentless mannerif you liked leon the professional you will enjoy the man from nowhere how can you not but admire someone who goes allout to save a 5 year old neighbor he barely knows from the worse dregs of society,cruel
i dont want to bore you with a long list of korean films i love but its important for you to know that i love korean films my favourite is probably i saw the devil so you can imagine my excitement when i sat down to watch the man from nowhere ill call it the man for short with koreas incredible reputation in films the man had a lot to live up to and it didnt disappoint the man demonstrates why korean films are so good in its opening half hour or so as it zooms in on a very touching but not fake relationship between a pawnshop man and a little girl whos mother is a heroin addict and altogether bad mother this relationship is so cockleswarming and cute you cant help but be sucked into these charactersi would guess that the american remake which will inevitably arrive will feature a mum with shelves full of mom of the year awards and the man ill call him the man as im quite bad at korean names will probably be a taintless guy who saves orphanages and adores kids however its the characters flaws that make them interesting realistic and altogether more likable for it the man isnt the nicest person in the world however he has great qualities and its enough to make the audience like him it turns out that he becomes even more badass than liam neeson and bruce willis put togetherive heard this film being compared to taken and oldboy but really this film is much much better than taken and i loved taken but not oldboy however its not that far off oldboys greatness but this just goes to show that foreign cinema is so much better than american in the majority of cases as taken was even directed and written by a frenchman the man however is superior in every way its narrative is more complex and its characters are much stronger and although it may not be as actionpacked as taken it certainly carries more of an emotional punchi do really want to give the man a 1010 but i dont think its right to the plot did become overly complicated in some parts especially with all the similarlooking faces and there were some parts where i was just waiting for some more action to happen but thats not to say that i didnt enjoy the man because i did at 2 hrs theres rarely a moment where the film dies down its a fantastic thrill ride which explores some typically dark avenues its korean and you cant help but appreciate it for having the balls to do sothere are also some incredible action sequences that are shot almost to perfection the camera is extremely quick but never does it make you feel disorientated as to what is going on these action scenes are more up to ip man standards which if you havent seen ip man is very high theres a hugely entertaining and tense fight scene in the mens toilets and it just leaves me wishing that there were more however the man is so much more than just an action film its got a huge heart and brain to match the directing is terrific and quite mesmerising at times one stand out moment features a smash through a twostorey window all in one shotall of this thrilling narrative culminates into a stupendously entertaining climax that almost feels as cool as kill bill its an action extraveganzer hard word to spell full of incredible directing and superbly choreographed fight sequences with quite a bit of blood too its a riproaring revenge rampage which is quite incredible to watch the ending however is even more impressive its quite simply one of the most touching endings ive ever seen with a great use of music that really pulls at the heart strings i had chills and those chills took a while to leave after the credits had rolled as it just created such an emotional impact that is quite hard to topthe man is quite simply another korean masterpiece its storyline might not be all that original but its characters and intricate plot points shoot it up into matching the greatness of the chaser the man excels in its wonderful characters and huge heart yes some parts couldve been simpler but its a film i cant wait to see again which certainly cant be a bad thing can it it rivals most american films and youll need the hardest heart in the world not to be touched by the knockout ending a truly mesmerising film,cruel
the man from nowhere is actually a rather amazing korean action crime and thriller movie piled into one great mixso just what makes this movie work well for starters the detailed and wellexecuted storyline it is the kind of story that picks you up and leaves you constantly wanting more and find out what happens next it is the kind of story that you immerse yourself into immediately and fullythe story is about a loner named cha taesik played by bin won running a pawnshop living alone and having contact with almost no one save a little girl named jeong somi played by saeron kim taesik steps up to take on a drug and organ trafficking ring when they kidnap somi and kill her mother taesik must stay one step ahead of the police if he is to bring down the ring and save his friendactually the story in the man from nowhere does have a great number of various levels upon which it works quite well because the director manages to interweave various plot lines well and make great crossconnections the story is not only a story of violence and action but it is also a story of compassion and love a story of friendship and acceptance but of course it is spiced up with a hefty amount of action that is really well executed and brought to the screen i might add and a solid crime story as wellthe movie wouldnt have worked out so well if it wasnt for a great ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast listthe man from nowhere was a great surprise for me and was thoroughly entertained from start to end i had never heard about this movie prior to picking it up and having done so i am glad i did you dont have to be a huge fan of asian cinema as i am to enjoy this movie because the storyline itself is rocksolid and nicely brought to life on the screen,cruel
i although agree with most of what has been said about this tremendous action packed korean thriller yes i agree with ninety nine percent of every thing its the best of the best i have rarely been disappointed by the korean movie industry contrary if i compare with the hk features or recent jananese releases no the only thing that annoys me in this awesome picture isisyes folks for those among you who know me through my previous comments youll guess easily  this is the ending i did not realize i did not want to accept this soooooooo predictable ending as we could have been waiting from an american film an ending only for sissies yes sissies for this kind of film i waited for a different ending such as the one we had with man on fire directed by the late tony scott this was a perfect ending this kind of topics are not like die hard series ones for god sakei love movies which destroy you literally in the inside movies that wipe you out turn you into pieces not this kind of ending what a shame for this fantastic piece of work,cruel
i begin this review as i have seen a good chunk of this movie about 46 minutes inso far i am hugely disappointed there has been close to no action and the plot is this sobstory that is supposed to hit your feels but it doesntwhy must always the relationship between the tough guy and the kid be the same the kid yappin on about all kinds of stuff and the tough guy just walking away in every scene without answering what the hell what kind of freaking idiot douche would just not answerand what is with the incredibly unfunny comic relief cop weird faces aint funny no moreif this movie is to redeem itself the action should be laid on pretty damn thick from now on i tell ya im off to watch the restok i have now seen the rest at about 35 minutes left the action actually picks up its not that great but at least its action near the end we get a pretty big and quite bloody fightaction scene not bad thank godin general this movie did not deliver what i was expecting at all little action and the fighting choreography and editing is sloppy and not well done at all really takes the fun out of it the parts with shooting are pretty decent but man what a disappointment the super sad story did not get to me at all either sorry movieoh and what the hell is the deal with having several potentially awesome fighting bits off screen really i could have douched it up and given this like a 2 but it is pretty well made and has certain qualities,cruel
i know this movie was out way before john wick but ive only seen it now so that was my first impression the plot is fairly simple and straight to the point while the action scenes are brutal i totally did not see that coming at first i thought ill just watch a korean action movie and i expected to get pretty emotional it did but not in the way i expectedsecond the atmosphere is superbly captured even though the music can get repetitive after a while this movie may have just become my reference for how action movies should be donei have only one annoyance with the man from nowhere aka the villains are stupid usually this is not the case in korean movies but in this one they seem to have copied the cliche from hollywood blockbuster guy drops his gun to fight barehanded just because it will look cool the fight scene that ensures sure does look cool but come on you had your chance and you wasted it because youre stupidfor once i want to see an action movie that is both gripping and the characters act smart until then i have to be content with what i can get and is one of the top movies of the genre,cruel
plot is maybe not amazing but it is still good but wow it doesnt get any better as far as production values execution of action scenes pacing it completely draws you in camerawork editing convincing acting and excellent acting by won bin playing the protagonist as well as the little girl and hey who doesnt like a well made revenge film lets hope hollywood will not butcher an american version in most cases which will very likely be made in the future yet i dont think it will ever match the emotions of the original,cruel
this is how you do a revenge movie it has a similar theme of a child being kidnapped and a former secret agent going to get herthe fights are brutal but the film also takes the time to make you feel for the characters so when the girl is kidnapped you really care you want to see our hero destroy everyone and everything to get her back,cruel
this movie is action to the max asian movies are really the only ones making the best actions movies right now sure every once in a while we get something like mad maxfury roads but most of the time it is stuff like xxxreturn of xander cage this movie has great action scenes a good mystery as well as good acting the only thing i really hate about this movie is that the final 5 minutes of this movie is so overdramatic that i actually rolled my eyes i mean we have the hero on his knees hugging a person crying while this person is saying something very sappy and there are people all around looking at them let us not forget that it is also raining toodespite this scene still a great action movie,cruel
10 points for this movie the story of this movie was incredible comparing it with john wick the truth surprised me a lot,cruel
this film is definitely my favorite foreign film so far this year the film is about a man cha taesik who lives a quiet life running a pawn shop he is loner whose only friend is a little girl somi who lives next door somi is a loner like cha taesik who can take care of herself and steal really well somis mother hyojeong is a heroin addict who stole drugs from a notorious koreanvietnamese drug gang and never provides or protects her daughter somi two gangsters go to taesiks pawn shop and attempt to take a package from him through force and guns but taesik easily overpowers them scaring them with his speed eventually the mother is caught beaten and kidnapped along with her daughter somi once taesik finds out he goes on a quest to save them in his search he finds other children being used to make drugs and deliver them he saves them and kills one of the drug lords brothers which causes the other to become furious threatening to rip somis eyes out and kill her he eventually finds out the somis mother has been killed and they tell him that they harvested somis eyes and killed her this enrages taesik and he heads out on a hunt for the druglord  once he arrives he is given a jar of eyeballsthat are not somis and thinks that they belong to somi this leads him to kill every drug member by either shooting them or slowly slitting their wrists he catches his breath and formulates some thoughts he rationalizes the situation and does not see another option than to kill himself so he has his gun to his head and is about to shoot himself when suddenly somi appears from the shadows untouched with both eyes,cruel
after his wife and unborn baby are hit and killed by a truck tae sik cha finds himself wrapped around the finger of a little girl who is at the mercy of her neglectful drug addicted mother working as a dancer although she steals and robs she only wants a friend and seems to find one in tae sik but he doesnt in her however when she is kidnapped by the korean mafia who kill her mother he goes to extreme and bloody lengths to save her from getting her organs sold on the black market with many other kids being held captive but the ending really confused me what happened to so mi and what happened to tae sik and why did he tell her he was going to hug her just once i would usually say that these types of suspenseful unknown endings are what makes the movie but this time for me it only added to the confusion of it also the amount of violence was insane and so unrealistic in my opinion i am not usually squeamish when it comes to violence and i usually do not mind it but i surprisingly found myself feeling literally sick with all of it the part about this movie that struck me the most is the fact that they were killing people for their body parts usually people are murdered for money or out of hatred or defense but i never thought about people being killed so their organs could be sold i was also super surprised when tae siks pregnant wife was hit by a car after just getting out from an ultra sound at first tae sik looked so different that i did not even recognize him nor did i realize that this scene was a flashback but then i realized that was probably because he had transformed as a person after everything happened with his family he let his hair grow shaggy so that it covered his face and when he shaved most of it off i think that was really a new turning point for him almost as if he had let go of the sadness and anger he felt about his wife being killed even though it doesnt seem like much for me i think that cutting off your hair represents change and wanting to change yourself to get ready for a new chapter in life which is what he was getting ready to do because he was trying to save so mi to be honest i dont think i would ever go to the lengths he did to save her but i cant help but think that maybe the little girl reminded him of what he would have had if it wasnt for his wife and unborn childs death maybe so mi represented his own child and filled that void he had for so long,cruel
decided to watch this on netflix on a whim and i wasnt disappointed highly enjoyable action movie i was a bit shocked on the violence depicted but you really felt the danger the little girl was in you also see through flashbacks why the man was intent on saving the little girl the story is simple but the characters are what really set this film apart it is violent but it also has heart the coolest shot is when the man jumps out the window and the camera follows very entertaining filmwith all the stories you hear about s korea and its problems with human trafficking you get a sense of justice with films like these it was the highest grossing film in s korea in 2010 and i think it really hit home with audience,cruel

watched this movie on netflix one evening due to boredom extremely glad i did this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen excellent action and very well executed characters all the actors did a phenomenal job especially the lead bin won he draws you in and you actually feel for the guy throughout the whole movie the flashbacks to his past truly made you feel for the character his facial expressions and his action was truly great i definitely need to check out some of his other films the actress who played the little girl was just right for this role storyline is similar to other movies such as man on fire but this film justified the story so well the last twenty or so minutes of this film is pure excellence dont be scared to watch this film because of reading sub titles you wont be disappointed,cruel
this is the first foreign action movie that i watched and boy was i blown the production values were as good as hollywood and at times even better the subtitles were very apt there is a bit too much of gore in this movie and hence giving it just a 8 instead of 9 the performance of the little girl  saeron kim is phenomenal she has the potential to be a starthe stunts are choreographed really well and is a treat to the eyes so it is not just jet li who can move like that the story and the direction was very tight i had a tough time reading the subtitles and watching the action at the same timethe gore is a little high and might not be suitable for all viewers but definitely a mustwatch if you love action flicks like i do,cruel
